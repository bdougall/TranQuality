This is the train, dev and test set data for the Indic Languages Task in WAT 2021. The languages involved are:
Bengali (bn), English (en), Gujarati (gu), Hindi (hi), Kannada (kn), Malayalam (ml), Marathi (mr), Oriya (or), Punjabi (pa), Tamil (ta) and Telugu (te).

The development and test sets are n-way parallel consisting of 1000 and 2390 lines respectively. They are selected from the PMI dataset.
This enables the evaluation between 110 translation directions but in WAT we will only evaluate translation to and from English.

The train sets come from several sources such as: PMI, PIB, MKB, ALT, JW, Wikimatrix, Tanzil, Ted2020, Bibleuedin, Opensubtitles2018, Iitb and Odiencorp2.0.
Not all sources contain training data for all language pairs.
We have filtered the training data to eliminate overlaps with the development set so please use the splits in this repo if you plan to use our test sets.

The folder structure is:

dev/dev.LANG [Where LANG is any of the aforementioned languages]
test/test.LANG [Where LANG is any of the aforementioned languages]
train/SOURCE/en-LANG/train.{en,LANG} [Where SOURCE is one of the aforementioned sources and LANG is any of the aforementioned languages]

Before using any other parallel corpus please contact the task organizers: Raj Dabre (prajdabre@gmail.com) and Anoop Kunchukuttan (anoop.kunchukuttan@gmail.com).
