The rationalization of Autonomous Bodies under Department of Health & Family Welfare will involve inter-ministerial consultations and review of existing bye laws of these bodies.
The time frame for implementation is one year,
Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN) was set up as a registered society to provide financial medical assistance to poor patients receiving treatment in designated central government hospitals.
Since the DoHFW provides funds to the hospitals, the grants can be given from the Department to the hospital directly.
RAN functions can, therefore, be vested in DoHFW.
Managing Committee of RAN Society will meet to dissolve the Autonomous Body (AB) as per provisions of Societies Registration Act, 1860 (SRA).
In addition to this, Health Minister’s Cancer Patient Fund (HMCPF) shall also be transferred to the Department.
The timeline required for this is one year.
Jansankhya Sthirata Kosh (JSK) was set up with a corpus grant of Rs.100 crores in the year 2003 to raise awareness for population stabilization strategies.
JSK organizes various activities with target populations as a part of its mandate.
There has been no continuous funding to JSK from the Ministry.
Population stabilization strategies require private and corporate funding, which can be accessed through JSK.
The main concern of the Government is that ABs are required to be reviewed and rationalised with a view to improve their outcomes, effectiveness and efficiency, utilisation of financial and human resources, synergy, governance and relevance in current policy and programme context, with improved monitoring and oversight.

A partnership between the two countries will provide a platform for interaction at the operational level and supplement initiatives associated with all International groupings and forums where both countries are members.
Following is the text of the PM’s address:-
Mr. President, Excellencies,
The ECOSOC is a key pillar of the United Nations structure.
Its creation as a distinct part of United Nations is a testimony to the centrality of development in the vision of the founders of the UN.
India was a proud participant in the creation of this body.
An eminent citizen of India, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar, was a key architect of ECOSOC.
He had the privilege of serving as the first President of ECOSOC at its inaugural session in 1946.
70 years have passed since this body was created.
We are now 15 years into the 21st century.
It is also the most important unfulfilled objective of the United Nations.
The 70th anniversary of the ECOSOC could not have come at a more appropriate moment.
The international community has just given to itself a new comprehensive vision of development.
The ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, presents a valuable opportunity for the UN system to rethink its role and purpose, and make itself more effective.
It is now the responsibility of ECOSOC to rise up to this challenge and contribute to making this Agenda a success.
The 2030 Agenda is a reflection of the challenges faced by poorer countries.
We in the developing world not only have to end poverty and hunger and satisfy the legitimate aspirations of our people for a better life, we also have to do so in a manner that is friendly to the planet and environment.
The developed countries on the other hand, face enormous responsibilities to rapidly move their economies on to a sustainable path, follow sustainable lifestyles and assist developing countries with finance and technologies.
At the same time, we have enormous resources at our command.
And technology today presents us with solutions that were unthinkable earlier.
The challenge is to channel the available resources and use technology to tackle the most urgent problems facing us.
I urge you to see this as an opportunity.
To rejuvenate the Council, to make it more action oriented, policy relevant and more responsive to the needs and aspirations of our people.
In doing so, the guiding philosophy of the ECOSOC must always be the welfare of the poorest of the poor, or ‘Antyodaya’ in Indian thought.
So long as there is poverty in the world, so long as our people, no matter in which country, remain deprived of basic human amenities, freedoms, rights and opportunities, the work of the ECOSOC will not be complete.
This objective is of particular significance for developing countries and emerging economies such as India, which is today the fastest growing large economy in the world.
India’s contribution to global economic growth and prosperity underlines our commitment to “Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development”, which is the theme of the Summit.
I look forward to meeting leaders from other G-20 countries to review the work of G-20 in the last ten years of its existence and chart the ways and means to meet the new and upcoming challenges of the coming decade.
I will highlight the need for reformed multilateralism which reflects the contemporary realities and can effectively strengthen collective action for global good.
As in the past, I look forward to the opportunity to meet leaders on the sidelines of the Summit to exchange views on bilateral matters of mutual interest”.

He said that the metro will provide a convenient and environment friendly mode of transportation for the people in Ahmedabad.
He said the card would ensure ‘One Nation-One Card’ for mobility.
He added that the indigenously built card has removed the previous international dependence on making such cards.
India is one of the few countries in the worldhaving aOne Nation-One Card fortransportation, PM added.
Prime Minister also spoke about the various initiatives taken by the State Government and Union government for the development of Gujarat, like water supply schemes, electricity for all, infrastructure development, housing for all and schemes for poor.
He also explained in detail the various schemes undertaken for the welfare of Adivasi community in the State.
The transformation of the Gujarat in the past couple of decades is due to meticulous planning and hard work of the people in the State, PM said.
He added that Gujarat should be taken as a case study on how development should be undertaken.
He mentioned that the multitude the infrastructural development projects being implemented in Gujarat will transform the State massively.

It is being set up using modular and prefabricated construction techniques, modern machinery, and environment-friendly features.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji was one of those social reformers, who made an important contribution for India.
In this context, he also spoke of the Bhakra Dam.
The Prime Minister mentioned Sir Chhotu Ram’s initiatives to provide remunerative prices to farmers, and also spoke of the steps taken by the Union Government in this regard.
Speaking about the progress of the Ayushman Bharat scheme, the Prime Minister said that the first beneficiary of the health assurance scheme was from this State.
He added that these are indications that we are progressing rapidly towards realizing the dreams of Sir Chhotu Ram.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to the phasing out of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).
The proposal entails abolishing the FIPB and allowing administrative Ministries/Departments to process applications for FDI requiring government approval.
The proposal for abolition of FIPB was approved by the Cabinet in its meeting on 24-05-2017.
Presently, applications are considered by FIPB in Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance comprising of various Secretaries of Government of India for making recommendation on FDI applications.
After the Cabinet decision, it would be handled independently by Administrative Ministries as per Sector.
I also welcome all those who are joining this event remotely from across the world, over the internet.
This was followed by the advent of social media, and the mobile phone as an important vehicle of data storage and communication.
Expressions such as the Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, have now become commonplace.
These indicate that change continues, perhaps at an even faster pace now.
Today, digital technology has emerged as a great enabler.
It has paved the way for efficient service delivery and governance.
It is improving access, in domains from education to health.
And it is helping to shape the future of business and economy.
Through each of these ways, it provides the less privileged sections of society, a more level playing field.
On a macro-scale, it has contributed to emergence of a flat world, where a developing nation like India can compete on a level footing with developed nations.
We believe it validates the Indian philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – the world is one family.
We in India, give primacy to the human face of technology, and are using it to improve what I call, “ease of living.”
Empowerment through digital access, is an objective that the Government of India is especially committed to.
“Digital India” is the world’s largest, technology-led transformative programme which is paving the way for our citizens to avail digital services.
We are using mobile power or M-power to empower our citizens.
Three factors: first, financial inclusion through our Jan-Dhan bank accounts; second, the Aadhaar platform; and third, the Mobile phone, have greatly helped reduce corruption.
We call this the J.A.M. or JAM trinity.
Today, a farmer can access a variety of services, such as soil-testing results, expert advice, and a good price for his produce, at the click of a button.
Digital technology is therefore contributing to increased farm incomes.
A small entrepreneur can register on the Government e-Marketplace, and bid competitively for supply of goods to the Government.
As he expands his business, he also contributes to lowering the cost of procurement for Government.
This leads to increased efficiency, and greater value for public money.
Pensioners no longer need to present themselves in front of a bank officer, to provide proof of life.
Digital technology has facilitated several new enterprises led by women.
Citizens of India are increasingly adopting cashless transactions.
For this, we created the Bharat Interface for Money – or BHIM App.
This App is helping the movement towards a less cash and corruption free society.
When we assumed office in May 2014, many people, particularly youngsters expressed a keen desire to share their ideas and work for the nation.
It is our firm belief that there are millions of Indians, whose transformative ideas can go a long way in taking India to new heights.
Therefore, we launched the citizen engagement portal, MyGov.
This platform enables citizens to share their thoughts and ideas on important issues.
In many key policy areas, we received thousands of valuable suggestions.
Many logo and emblem designs for various Government initiatives today, are the result of crowd-sourcing, and competitions on MyGov.
MyGov is a prime example of how technology strengthens democracy.
Let me turn to another example.
On assuming office, I realized that important government projects and initiatives often suffer on account of unnecessary silos in government functioning, and the lack of focused decision-making.
Therefore, we devised a cyberspace based platform, called PRAGATI or Proactive Governance for Timely Implementation.
PRAGATI, in Hindi, literally means progress.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I meet top Union and State government officials for a PRAGATI Session.
Technology breaks silos.
Sitting in our respective offices, aided by the cyber world, we discuss and resolve important governance issues.
I am happy to share with you that the PRAGATI sessions have resulted in faster decision-making, through consensus, in the larger interest of the nation.
PRAGATI has put back on track infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars which were stuck in red-tape.
I have even tried something of my own, through the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
This App deepens my connect with citizens.
The suggestions I get through the App are very useful.
At the back-end, these services will be catered for by many different departments of the Union and State Governments.
This integrated approach will add an automatic layer of “peer performance pressure”, in the working of these departments.
On the other hand, India is keen to find scalable models and innovative solutions in education and health, using digital technology.
We also wish to make cyberspace an enabler for the differently-abled.
Recently, during a thirty six hour Hackathon, college students suggested solutions to chronic problems that were put forward by Ministries.
We look forward to learn from global experiences and best practices.
We believe that growth happens only when we all grow together.
Cyberspace remains a key area for innovation.
Our startups today, are looking to provide solutions to common everyday problems, and improving the lives of people.
I am confident that the global investor community, will recognize the immense potential waiting to be tapped from India’s startup pool.
I invite you to invest in this space, and be a part of the unfolding story of Indian startups.
It offers equity of access, and equality of opportunity.
Today’s discourse is being shaped by Facebookers, Tweeples, and Instagrammers.
Social media platforms are making cyberspace participative for all.
News that experts tell us from studios, is now supplemented by experiences highlighted on social media.
This transition, to a blend of expertise and experience, is the contribution of the cyber world.
The global community needs to approach the issue of cyber-security with confidence, as much as with resolve.
Cyberspace technologies must remain an enabler for our people.
The quest for an open and accessible internet often leads to vulnerability.
Stories of hacking and defacement of websites are the tip of an iceberg.
They suggest that cyber attacks are a significant threat, especially in the democratic world.
We need to ensure that vulnerable sections of our society do not fall prey to the evil designs of cyber criminals.
Alertness towards cyber-security concerns, should become a way of life.
One of the major focus areas should be the training of well-equipped and capable professionals to counter cyber threats.
Cyber-warriors who will remain on the alert against cyber-attacks.
The term “hacking” may have acquired an exciting, even if dubious overtone.
We need to ensure that cyber protection becomes an attractive and viable career option for the youth.
On a related note, nations must also take responsibility to ensure that the digital space does not become a playground for the dark forces of terrorism and radicalization.
Information sharing and coordination among security agencies is essential to counter the ever-changing threat landscape.
Surely, we can walk the fine balance between privacy and openness on one hand, and national security on the other.
Together, we can overcome the differences between global and open systems on one hand, and nation-specific legal requirements on the other.
Important questions of transparency, privacy, trust and security may need to be addressed.
Digital technology serves to empower mankind.
We must ensure that it continues to stay that way.
The large multi-stakeholder participation at this event, is proof of the global endorsement that this platform has received.
Nation states, the industry, academia and civil society, all need to work towards a formal collaborative framework.
I am told that all the background and logistics have been handled digitally.
I hope delegates from around the world found it a smooth and seamless experience.
I conclude by wishing you fruitful and productive deliberations and outcomes.
I once again welcome you, and wish the conference all success.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired a roundtable meeting with top American CEOs from the financial sector.

The interactions happened on various days in the month of October 2017.
The last of these interactions was on October 17, 2017.
Subjects such as Governance, Corruption, Public Enterprises, Government e-Marketplace, Health, Education, Skill Development, Agriculture, Transportation, National Integration, Water Resources, Swachh Bharat, Culture, Communication, and Tourism came up for discussion during the interactions.
On Earth Day, let us reaffirm our commitment towards creating a better planet for our future generations.

Cooperation will also be effected through exchange of research scientists and experts; exchange of agricultural information and scientific publications (journals, books, bulletins, statistical data on agriculture and allied sectors); exchange of germplasm & agriculture technology; and conducting joint seminars, workshops, symposiums and other similar activities.
Under the MoU, a Joint Working Group (JWG) will be formed to enhance cooperation on matters of mutual interest including consultations on bilateral issues.
The JWG will meet at least annually in the initial two years, alternately in India and Egypt to formulate joint work programs, facilitation and consultation, including making additional supplementary engagements with regard to specific issues.
The Prime Minister appreciated the progress achieved in resolving outstanding Constitutional issues in Nepal, and expressed hope that all such issues would be resolved at the earliest in a spirit of cooperation and collaboration.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the foundation stone for the Dr. Ambedkar National Memorial, to be built at 26, Alipur Road in Delhi, the place of Mahaparinirvan of Dr. Ambedkar.
The plaque for the foundation stone was unveiled by the Prime Minister at Vigyan Bhawan.
Later, delivering the sixth Dr. Ambedkar Memorial Lecture, the Prime Minister categorically asserted that no changes will be made to the Union Government’s reservation policy, so as to deprive the weaker sections of society, of their existing entitlements.
He recalled that such misinformation had been spread even when Shri Vajpayee was the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister explained that five places were being developed as “Panchteerth” in honour of Dr. Ambedkar.
These included his birthplace in Mhow, the place in London where he stayed while studying in the UK, Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur, Mahaparinirvan Sthal in Delhi, and Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai.
In addition, the Prime Minister also referred to the building for the Dr. Ambedkar Foundation being built at Janpath in New Delhi.
He said that it is an injustice to Dr. Ambedkar to limit his contributions to just the Dalits, or even just to India.
Talking of recent policy initiatives and legislative measures, the Prime Minister said the vision for developing India’s maritime potential, and indeed for Inland Waterways, was first conceived by Dr. Ambedkar.
Similarly, the vision for providing electricity to all unconnected villages, which the Union Government has promised by 2018, is also a step towards fulfilling Dr. Ambedkar’s vision, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister recalled his recent meetings and interactions with Dalit Entrepreneurs, and the suggestions made by them.
He said all these suggestions had been implemented by the Union Government in the recent Union Budget.

These guidelines which were notified in February, 2012 will not be required for separate JV by the DPSUs.
The Guidelines issued by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) and Ministry of Finance (MoF) from time to time, which are uniformly applicable to all Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) will be applicable for the DPSUs to set up JV companies now.
This will meet the goal of indigenization / self-reliance in this sector.
The abolition of the existing JV Guidelines will provide a level playing field between DPSUs and the private sector.
It will allow DPSUs to forge partnerships in an innovative manner enhancing self-reliance in defence and provide for enhanced accountability / autonomy of DPSUs in ensuring that the process of JV formation is effectively managed by them, so as to secure best outcomes in the interest of national security.

India is elated on the accomplishment”, the Prime Minister said.
He said the life of every soldier is precious, and today no one can mess with India.
He said the Government is committed to taking every decision in national interest.

He added that this fear, is actually good.
He said enemies are fearful of India’s valour, and the corrupt are fearful of the law, and this fear is good.
He said that those who ruled the nation for many years had interests in two things – doles and deals.
He said that the biggest sufferers of this approach were our Jawans and Kisans.
He said that the defence sector suffered because of the deals made by some, while agriculture suffered because there was no concrete policy beyond doles.
It was launched within 24 days of announcement, he added.
He explained that fifty five months of his Government, and the fifty five years of the others have given two contrasting approaches to governance.
They had a ‘token approach’, we have a ‘total approach,’ he said.
In this context, he mentioned initiatives taken in the areas of One Rank One Pension for the Armed Forces; financial inclusion for the poor; clean cooking fuel (Ujjwala Yojana); Power for all; and Housing for all.
He asked a series of questions, such as why India was not Open Defecation Free till now; why there was no War Memorial or Police Memorial built for so many decades, etc.
He said India is today removing poverty at a rapid rate, and is the fastest growing large economy.
He said the period from 2014 to 2019, was to fulfil basic necessities for all; while the period from 2019 onwards is the period of fulfilling aspirations and achieving new heights of progress.

Thank you President Ashraf Ghani, for your presence.
It truly holds a special significance.
It is a privilege to be here.
Excellency Rouhani, President Ghani and I have just held detailed discussions on a range of issues.
The agenda for economic engagement is a clear priority for us.
We stand together in unity of our purpose.
To carve out new routes of peace, and prosperity is our common goal.
We want to link with the world.
But, better connectivity among ourselves is also our priority.
It is indeed a new dawn for the region.
Iran, Afghanistan and India are deeply aware of the richness and reality of our ancient links.
Through centuries, art and culture, ideas and knowledge, language and traditions have formed a common bond between us.
Even through turmoil of history, our societies never lost touch with each other.
Today, we meet to write new chapters in our engagement.
It is a new foundation of convergence between our three nations.
The corridor would spur unhindered flow of commerce throughout the region.
Inflow of capital and technology could lead to new industrial infrastructure in Chahbahar.
This would include gas based fertilizer plants, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and IT.
The key arteries of the corridor would pass through the Chahbahar port of Iran.
It’s very location, on the mouth of Gulf of Oman, is of great strategic significance.
Afghanistan will get an assured, effective, and a more friendly route to trade with the rest of the world.
The arc of economic benefit from this agreement would extend beyond our three nations.
Its reach could extend to the depths of the Central Asian countries.
When linked with the International North South Transport Corridor, it would touch South Asia at one end and Europe at another.
And, studies show that as compared to the traditional sea routes, it could bring down the cost and time of the cargo trade to Europe by about 50%.
Over time, we could even look to connect it with the strong sea and land based routes that India has developed with the Indian Ocean Region and South East Asia.
Today, the watch-words of international tiesare trust not suspicion; cooperation not dominance; inclusivity not exclusion.
This is also the guiding philosophy and driving spirit of the Chahbahar Agreement.
This will be a corridor of peace and prosperity for our peoples.
Motives of economic growth, and empowerment would drive it.
It will build our security without making others vulnerable.
It would break barriers among our nations and encourage new benchmarks of people-to-people contacts.
And, help us to eventually build what we all desire and deserve – a friendly and healthy neighbourhood.
The world around us is changing in fundamental ways.
And, the lack of comprehensive connectivity is not the only challenge that limits our national growth.
Political turmoil and undercurrents of economic stress continue to spread in West Asia.
In the Indo-Pacific,rise a mix of political competition and economic opportunities is putting pressure on the existing Asian order.
Global economy is yet to fully come out of uncertainty and weakness.
Our present growth and future prosperity is under threat from the spread of radical ideas and physical terror.
Amidst this landscape, our three countries are blessed with the most potent resource—our youth.
Our three nations are estimated to have more than 60 percent of their population under 30 years of age.
They are an asset in our national and regional development.
We want them to walk the road to knowledge and skills; industry and enterprise.
And, not fall victim to the path of guns and violence.
I am confident that economic fruits of the Chahbahar Agreement will expand trade, attract investment, build infrastructure, develop industry and create jobs for our youth.
The Agreement will strengthen our ability to stand in mutual support against those whose only motto is to maim and kill the innocents.
Its success will be a positive vote for peace and stability in the region.
It is my strong belief that trade and transit routes should only be a starting point of our journey to greater connectivity.
History will look back at this effort with nothing but approval and admiration.
I compliment Excellencies Rouhani and Ghani for their leadership in guiding this effort.
Thank you all.

Governor of Manipur, Dr. Najma Heptullah,
My ministerial colleague, Dr. Harsh Vardhan,
Other distinguished dignitaries on the dais,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me begin by paying my rich tributes to three very distinguished Indian scientists whom we lost in recent times – Padma Vibhushan Prof Yashpal, Padma Vibhushan Prof UR Rao and Padma Shri Dr Baldev Raj.
They all made out-standing contributions to Indian science and education.
Let us also join the world to mourn the death of one of the greatest physicists of our time, Stephen Hawking – one of the brightest stars of modern cosmology.
He was a friend of India and had visited our country twice.
The common man knows Hawking’s name, not because of his work on black holes, but because of his unusually high commitment and spirit against all odds.
I am delighted to be among scientists, whose work paves the way for a better tomorrow.
I am also pleased to see Manipur University hosting this important event.
The University is emerging as an important center of higher education in the North-East.
I am told, that this is just the second time in over a century that the Indian Science Congress is being held in the North-East.
This is a testimony to the resurgent spirit of the North East.
It bodes well for the future.
Science has been synonymous with progress and prosperity from time immemorial.
I stand here today, in this brave land of Manipur, where in April 1944 Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s INA gave the clarion call for freedom.
When you leave Manipur, I am sure you will also carry the same spirit of dedication to do something ever-lasting for our nation.
I am also sure you will continue to work closely with the scientists you have met here.
After all, effective solutions to big problems of science and technology, also require close cooperation and coordination among scientists across diverse streams.
The Union Government has initiated several new programs for the North-Eastern States, in the area of science.
We are now working to expand this network to all districts of the North-East.
Several new centers are bringing relevant science and technology to the North-East.
An “Ethno Medicinal Research Centre“ has been set up in Manipur.
This will undertake research on the wild herbs available in the North Eastern region, which have unique medicinal and aromatic properties.
State Climate Change Centers have been set up in seven North-Eastern States.
They will undertake risk analysis, and raise public awareness about climate change.
We have freed “bamboo” from being treated as a ‘Tree’ species, and classified it as a “Grass,” which it scientifically is.
For this, we changed a decades old law.
This amendment will allow for the free movement of bamboo.
It will ensure that the production and consumption centers are seamlessly integrated.
It will make farmers realize the true potential from the entire value chain in the bamboo ecosystem.
Government is also revamping the National Bamboo Mission with an outlay of Rs. 1200 crore.
States like Manipur will benefit from this decision.
The Indian Science Congress has a rich legacy.
During our interactions on various occasions, I have exhorted our scientists to seek solutions to our socio economic problems.
I have urged them to take up new challenges to benefit the poor and deprived sections of society.
In this context, the theme chosen for the Indian Science Congress this year, is quite appropriate: “Reaching the Unreached through Science and Technology”.
The theme is very close to my heart.
The roads made using this method are more durable, water resistant and load bearing.
At the same time he has found a constructive use for the ballooning problem of plastic waste.
Professor Vasudevan has given this technology to the Government for free.
This technology has already been used to lay over 5,000 kilometers of roads across 11 states.
Chintakindi Mallesham was given a Padma Shri in 2017, for inventing the Laxmi ASU Machine which significantly reduced the time and labour required to weave Sarees.
I therefore urge you to direct your research and innovation towards solving the problems of our times and meeting the aspirations of our people.
Scientific Social Responsibility is the need of the hour.
The Session’s theme also raises some questions.
Have we done enough to ensure that children in India are sufficiently exposed to science?
Are we giving them a conducive environment to develop their inherent talent?
Our scientific achievements need to be actively communicated to the society.
This will help inculcate scientific temper among the youth.
It will also excite and attract our young minds to careers in science.
We have to throw open our national institutions and laboratories to our children.
I call upon scientists to develop an appropriate mechanism for interaction with school-going children.
I also urge them, to spend 100 hours every year, with 100 students of Classes 10, 11 and 12 discussing various aspects of science and technology.
100 hours and 100 students, imagine how many scientists we can nurture this way!
We are committed to increasing the share of non-fossil fuel based capacity in the electricity mix above 40 per cent by 2030.
India is a leader in the multi-country International Solar Alliance and in Mission Innovation.
These groupings are providing a thrust to R&D for clean energy.
The Department of Atomic Energy is setting up ten new domestic Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors of 700 Mega Watt capacity each.
This is a major boost to the domestic nuclear industry.
It strengthens India’s credentials as a major nuclear manufacturing nation.
Our space research program has the capacity to successfully place over one hundred satellites in space in one go.
This has been made possible through the hard work and dedication of Indian Scientists.
After the success of Chandrayan-1 we plan to launch Chandrayan-2 in the coming months.
This fully indigenous effort will include landing and travel on the surface of the moon by a rover.
The greatest scientist of the last century, Albert Einstein had given the theory about “gravitational waves”.
It is a matter of immense pride for all of us that 37 Indian scientists from nine Indian institutions participated in the international Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) Collaboration and proved this theory correct three years ago.
Our Government has already given approval to establish third LIGO detector in the country.
It will expand our knowledge in basic Sciences in the areas of lasers, light waves, and computing.
I am told that our scientists are tirelessly working towards making this a reality.
I have talked about developing Clusters of Excellence in Science in Cities, around important Scientific Institutions.
We have recently approved a new “Prime Minister’s Research Fellows” scheme.
Under this Scheme, bright minds from the best Institutions in the country, namely, IISc, IIT, NIT, IISER and IIIT will be offered direct admission in Ph.D. Programme in IIT and IISc.
This scheme will help address the brain-drain from our country.
It will go a long way in promoting indigenous research in cutting-edge Science and Technology domains.
India faces major socio-economic challenges which affect large sections of our population.
We need science and technology to help us make India clean, green and prosperous.
Let me re-iterate some of my expectations from scientists.
A large section of our tribal population is affected by सिकलसेलअनीमिया.
Can our Scientists come up with a simple, cost-effective solution to this problem in the near future?
A large proportion of our children are affected by malnutrition.
To address this problem, the Government of India has launched the National Nutrition Mission.
Your suggestions and solutions can help us meet the objectives of the Mission.
India requires crores of new houses.
Can our scientists adopt 3D printing technology to help us meet this demand?
Our rivers are polluted.
It requires your innovative ideas and new technologies to clean them.
We need a multi-pronged approach including efficient solar and wind power, energy storage and electric mobility solutions, clean cooking, conversion of coal to clean fuels like methanol, cleaner power from coal, smart grids, micro-grids and bio-fuels.
We have set a target of having 100 Giga Watts of installed solar power by 2022.
Imagine the resources we will be saving on this account.
ISRO uses one of the best battery systems to run satellites in space.
Other institutions can partner with ISRO to develop cost effective and efficient battery systems for mobile phones and electric cars.
We need to develop new procedures, medicines, and vaccines to get rid of silent killers like Malaria and Japanese Encephalitis.
Research should also be conducted in Yoga, sports, and traditional knowledge disciplines.
Small and medium scale industry units have been the main-stay for employment generation.
With global competition, they are facing increasing challenges.
Can our scientific and technological institutions take up the cause of the MSME sector and assist these units in improving processes and products?
We have to be future ready in implementing technologies vital for the growth and prosperity of the nation.
Together with Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning and cyber-physical systems, effective communication will be a major ingredient in our success in smart manufacturing, smart cities, and Industry 4.0.Let us aim for India to be among the top 10 countries in the Global Innovation Index by 2030.
Four years from now, we will be celebrating the 75th year of our Independence.
This goal requires whole-hearted contribution from each one of you.
The Indian economy is on a high growth trajectory.
But we rank low in Human Development Indicators.
One of the important reasons for this in-consistency is major inter-state and intra-state disparity.
To address this, we have launched a concerted effort to improve the performance of over 100 Aspirational Districts.
We shall focus on important sectors such as Health and Nutrition; Education; Agriculture and Water Resources; Financial Inclusion; Skill Development; and Basic Infrastructure.
All these sectors require innovative solutions, which cater to local challenges and requirements.
The “one size fits all” approach cannot work in this case.
Can our Scientific Institutions serve these Aspirational Districts?
Can they catalyze creation and diffusion of appropriate technologies that generate skills and entrepreneur-ship?
This would be a great service to Mother India.
India has a rich tradition and a long history of both discovery and use science and technology.
It is time to reclaim our rightful place among the front-line nations in this field.
I call upon the scientific community to extend its research from the labs, to the land.
I am confident that through the dedicated efforts of our scientists, we are embarking on the road to a better future.
The future we wish for ourselves, and for our children.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for introduction of Dam Safety Bill, 2018 in the Parliament.
This shall also help in safeguarding human life, livestock and property.
The draft Bill has been finalised after wide consultation with leading Indian experts and international experts.
Plus there are thousands of medium and small dams.
Due to lack of legal and institutional architecture for dam safety in India, dam safety is an issue of concern.
Unsafe dams are a hazard and dam break may cause disasters, leading to huge loss of life and property.
The Dam Safety Bill, 2018 address all issues concerning dam safety including regular inspection of dams, Emergency Action Plan, comprehensive dam safety review, adequate repair and maintenance funds for dam safety, Instrumentation and Safety Manuals.
It lays onus of dam safety on the dam owner and provides for penal provisions for commission and omission of certain acts.
India is a founder member of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which came into existence in 1919.
At present, the ILO has 187 members.
The principal means of action in the ILO is the setting up of International standards in the form of Conventions, Recommendations and Protocol.
The MoU was signed in Bolivia in March, 2019.
The MoU will provide an institutional mechanism between India and Bolivia for cooperation in the field of Mineral Resources.

However, we can very well discern one characteristic that this entire journey of Indian festivals, its widespread effect, its depth, its reach to each individual are all interlinked with one spirit which exhorts evolution from the ‘self’ to the ‘whole’, the ‘collective existence’.
India’s tradition of celebrating festivals has been one to strengthen our love for nature and to develop each individual, right from childhood, as a cultured person.
The festival of lights Deepawali conveys the message of ‘TAMSO MA JYOTIRGAMAYA’, to move from darkness to light.
And, this darkness here does not merely signify the absence of light; it is also the darkness of superstition and blind-faith, darkness of ignorance, darkness of poverty and also darkness of social evils.
From countries of the East to those of the West, from developed nations to developing nations and from countries of Africa to Ireland – everywhere we can see the glow and revelry of Deepawali.
And, what is that picture about!
With a string of festive events such as Govardhan Puja, Bhai Dooj, Laabh Panchmi till Kartik Purnima – this festival of lights goes on for quite a long period of time.
I invited my countrymen to join the ‘Sandesh to Soldiers’ campaign.
What great responsibilities they have on their shoulders!
The “Sandesh to Soldiers” campaign has been launched on this Deepawali and is proving to be a morale booster for our brothers.
But how is this success achieved?
And so far I’ve heard that Haryana has managed to make seven or eight districts absolutely Kerosene free.
A campaign has to be started where the target will not only be limited to bring in reforms and transformation but also to obtain freedom from the problem.
Sir, I want to know how we can check such unfortunate events and incidents from taking place”.
In our march to achieve ‘Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas’, Co-operation from ALL, Development of ALL, we cannot have a better guiding force than Guru Nanak Dev.
I laud HAL and ADA on the induction of Tejas fighter jet.
This illustrates our skills and strengths to enhance indigenous defence manufacturing”, the Prime Minister said.
The MoU was signed in September, 2018 during the visit of the Vice-President of India to Romania.
The signing of Memorandum of Understanding with Romania will be instrumental in increasing arrival from this source market.
The two parties now desiring to strengthen and further develop the established relationship have signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Tourism, Government of the Republic of India and the Ministry of Tourism Government for the Romania for strengthening cooperation in the field of Tourism.
He said their contribution to the relief and rescue efforts during the Kerala floods was especially praiseworthy.

Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee also participated from Kolkata in the video-conference.
Petrapole-Benapole is an important land border crossing for India-Bangladesh trade.
More than 50 per cent of the India-Bangladesh trade passes through Petrapole.
Approximately 15 lakh people and 150,000 trucks cross Petrapole-Benapole every year.
It will also be the biggest land port in South Asia.
Your Excellency President Rouhani,
I am also grateful to you for the gracious hospitality given to me and my delegation.
On behalf of the 1.25 billion Indians, I extend warm greetings to the friendly people of Iran.
Through ages, the beauty and richness of the Persian heritage has attracted the world to Iran.
For me, visiting Iran, is indeed a great privilege.
India and Iran are not new friends.
Our dosti is as old as history.
Through centuries, our societies have stayed connected through art and architecture, ideas and traditions, and culture and commerce.
As friends and neighbours, we have shared interest in each other’s growth and prosperity, and joys and sorrows.
We can never forget that Iran was among the first countries to come forward in support when earthquake struck my state, Gujarat, in 2001.
Similarly, India is proud to have stood with the people of Iran during your difficult times.
I compliment the leadership of Iran for their far-sighted diplomacy.
In our meeting today, we focused on the full range of our bilateral engagement.
We exchanged views on the emerging regional situation and global issues of common concern.
The agenda and scope of our partnership is truly substantial.
The outcomes and agreements signed today open a new chapter in our strategic partnership.
The welfare of our people is guiding our broad based economic ties.
Expanded trade ties, deeper connectivity, including Railways partnerships in oil and gas sector fertilizers education and cultural sphere are driving our overall economic engagement.
The bilateral agreement to develop the Chahbahar port and related infrastructure, and availability of about US$ 500 million from India for this purpose, is an important milestone.
This major effort would boost economic growth in the region.
We are committed to take steps for early implementation of the agreements signed today.
Later today we are going to sign the trilateral Transport and Transit Agreement with participation of Iran, India and Afghanistan.
It will be a historic occasion.
It will open new routes for India, Iran and Afghanistan to connect among themselves.
India and Iran also share a crucial stake in peace, stability and prosperity of the region.
We also have shared concerns at the spread of forces of instability, radicalism and terror in our region.
We have agreed to consult closely and regularly on combating threats of terrorism, radicalism, drug trafficking and cyber crime.
We have also agreed to enhance interaction between our defence and security institutions on regional and maritime security.
The past history of our ties has been rich.
President Rouhani and I would leave no stone unturned to work for its glorious future.
Our friendship will be a factor of stability in our region.
Later today, I look forward to calling on His eminence the Hon’ble Supreme Leader to advance our ties further.
[Means: Once we make up our mind, the distance between Kaashi and Kaashan is only half a step]
I also thank you all.
He said delayed projects cause many problems, and the PRAGATI initiative had been initiated, to give priority to completion of projects.

As I arrived in Aizawl a short while ago, I was thrilled to witness once again, the enchanting beauty of Mizoram: the “Land of the Hill People.”
A land of peace and calm.
A people so warm and hospitable.
A State with one of the highest literacy rates in India.
Projects stuck for years, are now progressing.
Self Help Groups are also benefiting through credit linkages provided by the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation, with interest subsidy being provided by the Union Government.
I am told, the Ministry for Development of the North-East Region is also supporting the activities of the North Eastern Handicrafts and Handloom Development Corporation; and the North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation.
These Public Sector Under-takings are engaged in training and hand holding artisans, weavers and farmers, for marketing and food processing.
Technologies and products developed by Institutions such as CSIR, ICAR and the IITs should be studied for possible adoption in the North-East, to enable value addition of local produce.
This comes13 years after the last major central sector hydro-power project in the North-Eastern Region–the Kopili Stage-II.
Tuirial Hydro-power project is the first major Central Sector Project to be successfully commissioned in Mizoram.
It is the first large hydro-power project in the State.
It will produce 251 Million Units of electrical energy every year, and boost the socio-economic development of the State.
With the commissioning of this project, Mizoram becomes the third power-surplus State in the North-East, after Sikkim and Tripura.
The project was first declared and cleared by the Union Government of Prime Minister Vajpayee ji, way back in 1998, but got delayed.
The completion of this project is a reflection of our commitment to complete on-going projects and usher in a new era of development in the North Eastern region.
Besides generating electricity, the reservoir water will also open new avenues for navigation.
This will provide connectivity to remote villages.
The huge reservoir, spread over an area of 45 square kilometers, can also be used for development of fisheries.
This project will boost eco-tourism, and provide a source of assured drinking water supply.
I am informed that the State has a hydro-power potential of 2100 Mega-Watts, of which we have so far tapped only a fraction.
I see no reason why Mizoram cannot become a net-power exporter.
Our aim is not just to make the North Eastern States power surplus.
We also aim to develop a state-of-art transmission system which ensures that surplus power is transferred to other power deficient parts of the country.
Building a New India by 2022 requires us to work towards the twin goals of increasing economic growth as well as ensuring that the fruits of growth are shared by all.
In the spirit of सबका साथ, सबका विकास, every Indian, irrespective of caste, gender, religion, class must have equal opportunities to partake in the new prosperity.
My Government believes in competitive and cooperative federalism, where there is healthy competition between States.
I am convinced that States are the main drivers of change.
We have taken a number of initiatives to infuse healthy competition among States.
A Committee of Chief Ministers made recommendations to rationalize Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
We duly accepted the recommendations.
Despite fiscal constraints, the sharing pattern of core centrally sponsored schemes for North Eastern States has been continued at 90-10.
For other schemes, it stands at 80-20.
Friends, The vision of New India can be realized only if the fruits of development reach all.
The Union Government has plans to focus on around 115 districts which are relatively backward when evaluated on various social indicators.
This will also benefit the backward districts of North Eastern States including Mizoram.
Just yesterday, we approved a new Central Sector Scheme.
The North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme will fill the gaps in creation of infrastructure in two sectors.
One sector is physical infrastructure relating to water supply, power, connectivity and especially projects promoting tourism.
The other is social sector projects of education and health.
The new Scheme will be 100 percent centrally funded as against the NLCPR, where 10 percent contribution had to come from the State Governments.
The Central Government will be providing Rupees 5300 Crore to North Eastern States under the Scheme over the next three years.
Lack of connectivity is one of the biggest hurdles in the path of development of the North Eastern Region.
We aim for a Transformation by Transportation through investment in infrastructure in the region.
The Union Government will be investing another Rupees 60,000 crore under Special Accelerated Road Development Programme in the North-East and Rs. 30,000 crore under Bharatmala in the next two to three years to build a network of high-ways and roads in the North East Region.
We are committed to bring all the State Capitals of North East Region on the Rail map.
The Government of India is executing 15 New Rail Line projects of 1385 kilometers length, at a cost of over Rs.47,000 crore.
The railways reached Mizoram last year, with the inauguration of the rail line connecting Bhairabi in Mizoram with Silchar in Assam.
I had laid the foundation for a new line to take rail connectivity to Aizawl in 2014.
With the support of the State Government, we shall connect the State Capital Aizawl with broad gauge rail line.
The Union Government has been proactively following the ‘Act East Policy’.
As a gate-way to South East Asia, Mizoram stands to gain immensely from this.
It can emerge as a key transit point for trade with Myanmar and Bangladesh.
Various bilateral projects are at various stages of completion.
Some of the major initiatives include the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, the Rih-Tedim Road Project and Border Haats.
All these will increase the scope for economic linkages, and contribute to the overall economic growth and development of the North-Eastern Region.
Friends, The high literacy rate, scenic beauty and availability of large English speaking population in Mizoram make for a perfect blend to develop the State as a model tourist destination.
The Government is also committed to provide assistance for maintenance and up-keep of various wild-life sanctuaries and national parks in Mizoram with a view to attract tourists.
You could not transport or sell the Bamboo produced in your own field without a permit.
Our Government with an aim to reduce this pain, has changed the regulatory regime.
Now there will be no requirement of any permit or permission for producing, transporting and selling Bamboo and its products produced by farmers in their own fields.
This will benefit lakhs of farmers and will add to the efforts to double farmers’ income by 2022.
I see Aizawl wearing a colorful and festive look, and fully geared up for celebrating Christmas.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Note submitted by the Department of Commerce and approved the approach to be adopted by India at the Eleventh Ministerial Conference of the WTO held in Buenos Aires, Argentina in December 2017.
Some WTO member countries were seeking outcomes on domestic regulations in services, disciplines on fisheries subsidies, E-commerce, Investment Facilitation and Micro, Medium and Small Enterprises (MSMEs).
However, ultimately, there was no outcome on public stockholding for food security purposes or on other agriculture issues due to an absence of consensus.
The Bali Ministerial Decision together with the General Council Decision of November 2014, which was reaffirmed at the Tenth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in December 2015 protects India through availability of an interim mechanism on public stockholding for food security purposes, till a permanent solution is agreed and adopted by the WTO.
Thus, India’s foodgrain procurement programmes at Minimum Support Prices remain protected.
Ministerial decisions taken during the Conference include a Work Programme on disciplines on Fisheries Subsidies with a view to arriving at a decision by the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the WTO, in 2019.
It was also decided to continue with the non-negotiating mandate of the existing Work Programme on E-Commerce, as proposed by India.
As was done in previous Ministerial Conferences, an existing moratorium on imposing customs duties on electronic transmission was expanded for two years.
Ministerial decisions on new issues like Investment Facilitation, MSMEs, gender and trade, which lacked a mandate or consensus, were not taken forward.
India did not support the draft Ministerial Declaration as it excluded or failed to adequately cover important issues such as multilateralism, the Doha Development Agenda and special and differential treatment of developing countries.
However, wide support was expressed for the multilateral trading system and the commitment to move forward on various areas of work in the WTO.
It is also noteworthy that even in the absence of a Ministerial Declaration, the existing mandates and decisions ensure that work will go forward and Members will continue to work on issues such as the permanent solution on public stockholding for food security purposes, an agricultural Special Safeguard Mechanism, agricultural subsidies and other issues.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has conveyed his greetings to the citizens on the occasion of various festivals across the Nation.
In a series of tweets the PM wished that may these festivals bring joy and happiness in our lives.

Bhogi greetings to all those celebrating.
On Makar Sankranti, I extend my heartfelt greetings to people across the Nation,” the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval to rename the Agartala Airport in Tripura as ‘Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore Airport, Agartala.
The decision comes in the wake of the long pending demand of people of Tripura as well as the Tripura Government for paying tribute to Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore.
Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore, who ascended the throne of the erstwhile Tripura Princely State in 1923, was an enlightened and benevolent ruler.
Agartala Airport was constructed in 1942 on the land donated by Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore.
As a visionary ruler, who had travelled extensively across the globe, he took several steps for the all-round development of Tripura.
Hence, it is apt to rename the Agartala Airport after his name, which will be a befitting tribute to Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore.
Further, the MoC entails exchange of information and technology between the two countries.
Environmental degradation falls on the socially and economically disadvantaged, more heavily than better-off sections of the society.
Any effort at thwarting environmental degradation would lead to environmental equity in the sense of availability of sound environmental resources to all sections of the society.
The MoC is expected to bring in the latest technologies and best practices suited for bringing about better environment protection, better conservation, better management of climate change and bio-diversity conservation.
Officials briefed the Prime Minister on progress in various areas of scientific research.
Giving the example of talent spotting in sports, the Prime Minister said that mechanisms should be made to identify the brightest and best science talent among school students.
He said that a lot of innovation is happening at the grassroots level.
Urging officials to break silos, the Prime Minister strongly emphasized that a mechanism should be formed to document and replicate successful innovations at the grassroots level.
In this context, he also mentioned innovations being done by defence personnel.
In the agriculture sector, the Prime Minister identified high-protein pulses, fortified foods, and value addition in castor, as priority areas which needed to be speeded up.
In the energy sector, the Prime Minister said that the possibilities of solar energy should be pursued to the maximum, to reduce dependence on energy imports.
Expressing confidence in the abilities of Indian scientists to rise up to the challenges, and provide solutions to improve the lives of the common man in India, the Prime Minister asked the officials to draw up clear targets to be achieved by 2022, the 75th year of independence.
He appreciated the frequent high-level exchanges between the two sides as both countries celebrate the 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations this year.

An amount of Rs.143.604 crore will be required for the period of one year during 2018-19.
Hence the approval by the Cabinet which will give a boost to the vulnerable rural families in Jammu & Kashmir.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the revision in the salaries, gratuity, allowances, pension etc. of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts and retired Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts.
It follows the implementation of recommendations of the 7thCentral Pay Commission in respect of Civil Servants.
The approval will pave the way for necessary amendments in the two laws viz.
Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958 and High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954, which govern the salaries of Chief Justice of India (CJI), Judges of Supreme Court of India, Chief Justices and all Judges of High Courts.
The increase in the salary and allowances etc. will benefit 31 Judges of Supreme Court of India (including the CJI) and 1079 Judges(including the Chief Justices) of High Courts.
Besides, approximately 2500 retired Judges will also be benefited on account of revision of pension/gratuity etc.
Arrears on account of revised salaries, gratuity, pension and family pension w.e.f 01.01.2016 will be paid as one time lump sum payment.
Background:-
Salaries, gratuity, pension, allowances etc. in respect of Judges of Supreme Court are governed by the Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958.
Salaries etc. of Judges of High Courts are governed by High Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954.
An amendment in the Acts is required whenever there is any proposal for revision of salaries/pension gratuity, allowances etc. in respect of Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts.
Therefore, Government proposes to move a Bill in the Parliament in the ensuing Session for amendment in the relevant Acts for giving effect to the revision of salaries and allowances.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has extended his greetings on World Radio Day to all the radio lovers and to those working in the radio industry.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) for farmers for the year 2017-18.
This will help farmers getting short term crop loan up to Rs. 3 lakh payable within one year at only 4% per annum.
The Government has earmarked a sum of Rs. 20,339 crore for this purpose.
The interest subvention will be given to Public Sector Banks (PSBs), Private Sector Banks, Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) on use of own funds and to NABARD for refinance to RRBs and Cooperative Banks.
The Interest Subvention Scheme will continue for one year and it will be implemented by NABARD and RBI.
The objective of the scheme is to make available at ground level, agricultural credit for Short Term crop loans at an affordable rate to give a boost to agricultural productivity and production in the country.
The salient features of the scheme are as follows:
The Central Government will provide interest subvention of 5 per cent per annum to all prompt payee farmers for short term crop loan upto one year for loan upto Rs. 3 lakhs borrowed by them during the year 2017-18.
Farmers will thus have to effectively pay only 4% as interest.
In case farmers do not repay the short term crop loan in time they would be eligible for interest subvention of 2% as against 5% available above.
The Central Government will provide approximately Rs. 20,339 crore as interest subvention for 2017-18.
To provide relief to the farmers affected by natural calamities, the interest subvention of 2% will be provided to Banks for the first year on the restructured amount.
In case farmers do not repay the short term crop loan in time they would be eligible for interest subvention of 2% as against available above.
Credit is a critical input in achieving high productivity and overall production in the agricultural sector.
This institutional credit will help in delinking the farmers from non-institutional sources of credit, where they are compelled to borrow at usurious rates of interest.
Since the crop insurance under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is linked to availing of crop loans, the farmers would stand to benefit from both farmer oriented initiatives of the Government, by accessing the crop loans.
An important initiative of the government is market reforms, with a view to ensuring that the farmers benefit from remunerative prices for their produce in the market.
It is a great pleasure to host a personal friend and a great champion of India-Japan partnership.
No partner has played such a decisive role in India’s economic transformation as Japan.
No friend will matter more in realising India’s economic dreams than Japan.
And, I cannot think of a strategic partnership that can exercise a more profound influence on shaping the course of Asia and our interlinked ocean regions more than ours.
That is why we deeply value our Special Strategic and Global Partnership”.
It enjoys unmatched public goodwill and political consensus in India.
It also comes with great public expectations and huge responsibilities for us.
In the course of the past year, we have done much to live up to them.
We have made enormous progress in economic cooperation as also in our regional partnership and security cooperation.
Japanese private investments are also rising sharply.
Today, we have scaled new summits in our shared journey.
The Memorandum we signed on civil nuclear energy cooperation is more than just an agreement for commerce and clean energy.
It is shining symbol of a new level of mutual confidence and strategic partnership in the cause of a peaceful and secure world.
I know the significance of this decision for Japan.
And, I assure you that India deeply respects that decision and will honour our shared commitments.
No less historic is our decision to introduce High Speed Rail on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector through the Japan’s Shinkansen, known for its speed, reliability and safety.
We also appreciate the sharp increase in Japanese bilateral assistance programme and the strength of public and private Japanese commitment for the Make in India mission.
But, together we are quickly turning it into reality.
Our shared commitment to combating climate change is equally strong.
We are engaged in wide ranging collaboration in clean energy and energy efficiency technologies that will also create solutions for the benefit of others in the world.
The other agreements today reflect the depth and diversity of our cooperation.
Today, we have also taken two more decisive steps in our security cooperation.
The two agreements will deepen our defence relations and promote defence manufacturing in India.
This builds on our decision to expand staff talks to all three wings of the Armed Forces and make Japan a partner in Malabar Naval Exercises.
We have also advanced our regional partnership in the course of the year.
We have raised the level of our tri-lateral dialogue with the United States and launched a new one with Australia.
We will work together in East Asia Summit to promote an inclusive, balanced and open regional architecture and maritime security in the region.
We stand strongly for ensuring freedom of navigation and over-flight, and maritime commerce.
We believe that disputes must be resolved peacefully and that all countries must abide by international law and norms on maritime issues.
Culture and people breathe life into a relationship.
Our remarkable relationship also has a wonderful human touch.
The Kyoto-Varanasi partnership is one of its strong symbols.
Later today, I will show him the ancient heritage of Varanasi and our plans for its modern future.
Finally , in recognition of our special relationship, India will extend ‘visa on arrival’ to Japanese citizens including for business purpose from 1st March 2016.
This is different from the electronic visa facility that is being extended globally.
in a world of intense international engagements, few visits are truly historic or change the course of a relationship.
Your visit, Mr. Prime Minister, is one.
As we work to realise the Vision 2025 of India-Japan ties, we will advance the prosperity of our people and shape an Asian century in our vision and values.
This will be my first bilateral visit to the Philippines where I will also participate in the ASEAN-India and East Asia Summits.
My participation in them symbolises India’s commitment to continue deepening relationship with ASEAN Member States, in particular, and with the Indo-Pacific region, in general, within the framework of my Government’s Act East Policy.
During my first visit to the Philippines, I look forward to have a bilateral meeting with President of the Philippines HE Mr. Rodrigo Duterte.
I also look forward to connecting with the Indian community in Philippines.
International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) through Scientific Research and Development has developed better quality of rice seed and helped the global community in addressing food scarcity issues.
Since its establishment in 1989, MPFI has fitted nearly 15,000 amputees in the Philippines with Jaipur Foot making them capable of living a new life.
I am confident that my visit to Manila will give a new boost to India’s bilateral relations with the Philippines and also further strengthen the politico-security, economic and socio-cultural pillars of our engagement with ASEAN.”

The decision intends to ensure availability of resources with Cooperative Banks help farmers in easily accessing crop loans from Cooperative Banks to overcome the difficulties in view of the reduction in availability of cash for carrying out Rabi operations.
Additional resources are to be provided to Cooperative Banks through NABARD for refinance to the Cooperative Banks on account of interest waiver of two months for November and December, 2016.
This will be extended by Cooperative Banks to the farmers in the current financial year 2016-17.
An additional financial liability of Rs. 1060.50 crore will be required for this purpose.
The Prime Minister will arrive in Daman on Saturday.
He will launch various development projects, and hand over certificates to beneficiaries of various official schemes.
The Prime Minister will also address a public meeting in Puducherry.
On Sunday evening, the Prime Minister will be in Surat, Gujarat, for the flagging off of the “Run for New India Marathon.”
The Government of India attaches the highest priority to job creation.
India suffers from a lack of reliable, timely data on employment which has made it difficult for policy makers and independent observers to assess the extent of employment generation at different points of time.
Some data is collected and published by certain agencies including the Labour Bureau, but the coverage is very small.
The Labour Bureau data covers only a few sectors and the methodology is not based on updated panel of survey respondents.
The net result has been that both policy making and analysis are conducted in a data vacuum.
In view of the importance of timely and reliable data on employment, the Prime Minister has directed the Prime Minister’s Office and concerned Ministries to come up with a solution to fill this long standing gap in the country’s statistical architecture.
The Task Force will recommend solutions which can be implemented in a time bound manner.
The Prime Minister has directed that this task be expedited so that policies on employment can be formulated with a proper appreciation of impacts, based on credible data.
The Prime Minister called upon Governors to strengthen the “Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat” initiative, which promotes partnerships, cultural exchanges and people to people linkages among States.
The Prime Minister urged Governors, in their capacity as Chancellors, to call upon Universities to promote excellence in various spheres of academics.
He said that Indian Universities must aspire to be among the world’s best, and Governors can play a crucial role in catalysing their transformation.
He said the upcoming KumbhMela could also serve as an important occasion for promoting nationally relevant causes.
He conveyed President Putin’s greetings to Prime Minister and briefed him on the progress in ongoing projects between India and Russia.
Prime Minister described Russia as a time-tested and reliable friend and reaffirmed the shared commitment with President Putin to expand, strengthen and deepen bilateral engagement across all domains.
He recalled his recent meeting with President Putin in Tashkent in June and via video-link for dedication of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit 1 at the beginning of this month.
Prime Minister conveyed that India is eagerly awaiting President Putin’s visit to India.
Implementation strategy:
After the approval, the pay scales adopted by Hydro CPSEs consequent upon the order of the Ministry of Power dated 04.04.2006 and 01.09.2006 shall be regularized.
About 5,254 Executives of Hydro CPSEs enrolled before 01.01.2007 will be benefitted by this approval.
The pay scales of workmen and Supervisors were higher than the pay scale of Executives in the E-1 grade.
The proposal was earlier considered by the Committee of Secretaries (CoS) and the Cabinet on several occasion.
The pay scales shall be fitted w.e.f.
Aggrieved with the order, various Employee Associations of Hydro PSEs filed Writ Petitions in different High Courts.
The High Court of Uttarakhand&Meghalaya quashed the above decision.
A Contempt petition has been filed in the High Courts of Meghalaya and Uttarakhand.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal –
to provide land on lease to Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Limited (HURL);
to provide the Concession Agreements & Land Lease Agreements for the revival of Gorakhpur & Sindri units of Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited (FCIL) and Barauni unit of Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited (HFCL) by HURL; and
The revival of Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni units of FCIL/HFCL will ensure substantial investment in the fertilizer sector.
These units will act as anchor customer to Jagdishpur-Haldia Pipeline (JHPL) gas pipeline being laid for development of critical infrastructure in Eastern India.
This will create job opportunities in the region and also boost the economy of the eastern region/state.
The revival of fertilizer unit will also augment indigenous production of urea thereby enhancing self-reliance in urea.
HURL, a Joint Venture company of NTPC, IOCL, CIL and FCIL/ HFCL was incorporated in June 2016 to implement the fertilizer revival projects at Gorakhpur, Sindri, and Barauni.
In order to facilitate HURL to set up the fertilizer projects at the three locations, Lease Deeds are to be signed with HURL by FCIL/HFCL.
The lease of land is for a period of 55 years.
The Lessee (HURL) would pay a nominal Lease Rent of Rs.1 lakh per annum to the Lessor (FCIL/HFCL).
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to amend regulation for foreign investment in the Non- Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs).
By leveraging advantages of private sector enterprise and public capital in terms of Government land, it would create new institutes of expertise, knowledge and competitiveness.

The Prime Minister drew a contrast between different forms of competition between now and prior to 2014.
He said that the competition now is on development, and achieving aspirational targets such as total sanitation, or total electrification, or higher investment.
By contrast, he said that earlier, the apparent competition seemed to be on delays and corruption.
The Prime Minister strongly criticized what he described as a “narrative” that certain things are just impossible in India.
He said that a perception had been made that governments cannot be pro-growth and pro-poor at the same time,but people of India are making it possible.
He said that during 2014 to 2019, the country would register average growth of 7.4 percent and the average inflation would be less than four and a half percent.
Post liberalization of the Indian economy, this will be the highest rate of average growth and lowest rate of average inflation witnessed during the period of any government, he added.
In the last four years, the amount of Foreign Direct Investment received in the country was almost equal to what was received in seven years before 2014, the Prime Minister said.
He added that to achieve this, India needed reforms to transform.
Through the Bankruptcy Code, GST, Real Estate Act to name a few, a solid foundation for decades of higher growth has been laid, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that India is a country of 130 crore aspirations and there can never be a singular vision for development and progress.
“Our vision of new India caters to all sections of the society, irrespective of their economic profile, their caste, creed, language and religion,” he added.
Shri Narendra Modi said “our vision of New India includes addressing the challenges of the future while also solving problems of the past.”
While India is buildingIITs & AIIMS at a rapid pace, it has also built toilets in all schools across the country.
While India is building a 100 smart cities across the country, it is also ensuring rapid progress in over 100 aspirational districts.
While India has become a net exporter of electricity, it has also ensured that crores of households which were in darkness since independence have got electricity.
Speaking of positive interventions in the social sector, the Prime Minister said that the Government is reaching out to twelve crore small and marginal farmers by providing them a comfort of rupees six thousand every year.
This will transfer 7.5 lakh crore rupees or about one hundred billion dollars to our farmers over the next ten years, he added.
“Wishing our most beloved & widely respected Atal Ji a happy birthday.
I pray that he is blessed with good health and a long life.
Atal ji’s exemplary service & leadership has had a very positive impact on India’s growth trajectory.
His great personality is endearing”, the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval forentering into an Agreement between India and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes on income.

I will arrive in Hangzhou from Vietnam where I would have concluded an important bilateral visit.
During the G-20 Summit, I will have an opportunity to engage with other world leaders on pressing international priorities and challenges.
India will engage constructively on all the issues before us and work towards finding solutions and taking forward the agenda for a robust, inclusive and sustainable international economic order that uplifts the socio-economic conditions of people across the world, especially those who need it most in developing countries.
I look forward to a productive and outcome oriented Summit.”
I am pleased to participate in this meeting with the BRICS Business Council.
The work you do in the Business Council plays a vital role in giving practical shape to the vision of BRICS partnership.
At this meeting last year in Goa, there was a suggestion on closer cooperation between the NDB and BRICS Business Council.
I am happy to note that you are entering into an MOU with the NDB.
India is changing fast into one of the most open economies in the world today.
Foreign Direct Investment inflows are at an all-time high, rising by 40 per cent.
The Goods and Services Tax that was introduced in July is India’s biggest economic reform measure ever.
In one stroke, a unified market of 1.3 billion people has been created.
Programmes like Digital India, Start Up India and Make in India are changing the economic landscape of the country.
I am happy to note that the BRICS Business Council also has matching priorities of trade & investment facilitation, promoting skills development, infrastructure development, SME Development, e-commerce and digital economy.
Many productive recommendations have come out of your deliberations.
Your work towards establishment of a BRICS Rating Agency, energy cooperation, green finance, and digital economy is particularly noteworthy.
Let me conclude by saying that as Governments, we will offer full support to your endeavours.
Greetings to everyone.
Swami Nirvinananda ji and all the devotees of Sri Sri Thakur Ramakrishna Paramhansa assembled here today, greetings.
When I think of the words of a great mind from Bengal, translated into Malayalam, being read and debated in Kerala, I am humbled by how ideas are shared and adapted across our country.
What could be a better example of Ek Bharat…Shreshtha Bharat?
This practice that you have started builds on a long tradition of making the teachings of the scriptures, the words of great gurus available to the common people.
This is part of the long oral tradition of India that has evolved constantly to adapt to changing times and circumstances, keeping the eternal values intact.
Shrutis are believed to be revealed divine knowledge, transmitted orally.
Smriti is a class of texts that are based on memory and interpretation.
Since the Vedas and the Upanishads were difficult to understand for common people, the smritis were written to explain, interpret, and clarify primary revelation through stories and moral lessons.
Thus it is clear that the epics, Puranas and the Arthasastra of Kautilya are all smritis.
The effort to reach every person through the means that are best suited to them continued over time.
To reach the common people, there was a need to make dharma, or right living, more accessible, closer to their daily lives.
The message of the saints was carried further by folk singers, the Katha-vachak, the dastangois.
Kabir’s dohas, Meera’s bhajans were carried by singers from village to village.
India is a land that is blessed with a rich cultural and intellectual milieu.
Our land is home to writers, scholars, saints and seers who have expressed themselves freely and fearlessly.
And whenever the history of human civilization has entered the era of knowledge, India has shown the way.
A false perception was created about India that India needed social, political and economic reform initiated by outsiders.
And this change originated from within, driven by our saints and seers who made it their mission to transform society and undertake mass movements to eradicate evils that may have entered into our society.
Our Saints integrated each and every citizen in their quest for social reform.
Nobody was left outside the ambit.
This is why our civilization stands tall, overcoming obstacles.
Those civilizations that did not change with time vanished.
We, on the other hand even altered practices over centuries.
Some practice may have been prevalent a few centuries ago but if it was felt redundant, it was altered.
We have always been open to new ideas.
Through our history, our Saints did things that may seem small but their impact was big and this altered the course of our history.
Long before any faith, any culture, India had women saints who took up the issue of gender equality.
They wrote fearlessly and expressed themselves through their powerful writings.
We all remember the role of Shri Narayana Guru in transforming Kerala.
A saint and social reformer from a backward caste who transcended the barriers of caste and promoted social justice.
When the Sivagiri pilgrimage was started, he declared its goals to be the promotion of education, cleanliness, devotion to God, organization, agriculture, trade, handicrafts, and technical training.
Could there be a better example of a teacher setting standards for the advancement of society?
But he renewed the tradition and made it stronger.
He broke the mental barriers that keep us apart barriers between religions, between castes.
He was the saint of social harmony.
His message is that of tolerance, of devotion, of surrendering oneself to the divine of One Lord with different names – the gyaani, the yogi, and the devotee.
“The same Being whom gyaanis call Brahma – the Absolute, is called Atma – Universal Soul, by yogis, and Bhagavan – Personal God with divine attributes, by devotees.
He found that there were many ways to the divine, but followed with devotion, they all lead to one goal.
“The Reality is one and the same;” he said, ” the difference is in name and form.”
In Kerala you call it ‘Vellam.’
All of them denote one and the same thing, the difference being in the name only.
In the same way, some address the Reality as ‘Allah’, some as ‘God’, some as ‘Brahma’, some as ‘Kāli’, and others by such names as ‘Rama’, ‘Jesus’, ‘Durga’,’Hari.'”
His teachings are particularly relevant to us today, when we are confronted with people who use religion, caste to divide and create animosity.
Mahatma Gandhi said: Ramakrishna’s life enables us to see God face to face.
No one can read the story of his life without being convinced that God alone is real and that all else is an illusion.
Sri Ramakrishna is a link between the ancient and the modern.
He showed how the ancient ideals and experiences could be realized even while following the modern way of life.
Simple anecdotes, simple messages – told simply.
But due to their very simplicity, these were embedded in the minds of the listeners.
If we had not a teacher like this, would there have been a disciple like Swami Vivekananda?
The great karmayogi took forward the thought of his guru –
Why not worship them first?
Let these people be your God.
His clarion call -“Now is wanted intense Karma-Yoga with un-bounded courage and indomitable strength in the heart.
Then only will the people of the country be roused” – continues to inspire us to action, continues to give us courage.
Ramakrishna Mission’s record of service is evidence of this commitment.
We find the mission in poor areas, among tribals, in areas stricken by need or disaster trying to alleviate suffering.
It does not matter what community the person is from, what her caste or beliefs are.
He said that the world has come forward to support the idea of International Day of Yoga.
He said that Yoga is not about what one will get, but it is about what one can give up.
He said that with zero budget, Yoga provides health assurance, and does not discriminate between rich and poor.
The Prime Minister called for focus in the next one year, on how to mitigate diabetes through Yoga.
He said that to honour those who are working to popularize Yoga, two awards will be instituted, one at the national level, and the other at the international level.
The Prime Minister walked amidst, joined, and mingled with the participants of the mass Yoga demonstration.
He was a widely admired musical maestro.
He inaugurated 100 Jan AushadhiKendras in the State.
He also dedicated a bridge over the River Ganga at Balughat, Chunar, which will facilitate connectivity between Mirzapur and Varanasi.
He said the Bansagar project had been first conceptualized about four decades ago, and the Foundation Stone was laid in 1978, but the project was unduly delayed.
He also spoke of other social welfare schemes of the Union Government.
Addressing a large public meeting on the occasion, the Prime Minister congratulated the State Government in Assam and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, for the work done by them in the State.
He stressed on the need of modern agriculture and technological interventions, keeping in mind the specific needs of the region.
The Prime Minister spoke of “Panch Tatva” – five elements to boost connectivity in the North-East: Railways, Highways, Airways, Waterways, and i-ways.
He said his Government is working towards boosting prosperity and welfare of the people in the North-East through this “panch-tatva.”
Mr. Li Yuanchao, Vice President of the People’s Republic of China met Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
The Prime Minister warmly recalled the visit of President Xi Jinping to India last year, and his own visit to China in May this year.
The Prime Minister said that there is tremendous potential for India and China to grow their economic and developmental partnership.
He highlighted opportunities in Railways, Smart Cities, Infrastructure and Urban Transport for cooperation between India and China.
The Prime Minister welcomed the increased level of investments from China to India and expressed hope that the growth in the number of Chinese tourists visiting India will continue.
He said that the ancient cultural ties between India and China are a catalyst for growth of stronger people to people relations.
The Prime Minister and Mr. Li Yuanchao agreed that peaceful, cooperative and stable relations between India and China are vital for regional and global peace and prosperity.
This will ensure to meet the mandate provided to NCLAT by the Finance Act, 2017, the Companies Act, the IBC, 2016 and the time frame provided for disposal of cases.
It is expected that with adjudication of dispute by the Tribunal, the long-pending dispute between States of Odisha and Chhattisgarh on Mahanadi river will come to a final settlement.
India values her multi-faceted partnership with the EU, and we attach high importance to our strategic partnership.
India was amongst the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the European Economic Community in 1962.
The European Union has been our largest trade partner for a long time.
It is also one of our largest sources of Foreign Direct Investment.
As the world’s largest democracies, we are natural partners.
Our close relations are founded on the shared values of democracy, rule of law, respect for fundamental freedoms and multiculturalism.
We also share the vision of a multi-polar, rules-based international order.
Since the 13th Summit in Brussels last year, our relationship has steadily gained momentum.
To use the words of President Juncker a few days ago, India-European Union relations today have a good wind in their sails!
We have expanded the India-EU engagement into many new sectors and have agreed that we must continue our efforts to make it more comprehensive and beneficial, based on mutual trust and understanding.
We have agreed to strengthen our security cooperation and work together against terrorism.
We will not only further strengthen our bilateral cooperation on this issue, but will also increase our cooperation and coordination in multilateral fora.
On Clean Energy and Climate Change, we are both committed to the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Addressing climate change and promoting secure, affordable and sustainable supplies of energy are our shared priorities.
We also reaffirmed our commitment to undertake mutual cooperation for reducing the cost of deployment of renewable energy.
We will strengthen our cooperation with European Union in developing Smart Cities and upgrading urban infrastructure.
I am pleased that the India-EU Horizontal Civil Aviation Agreement has now been operationalized.
I am confident that this will enhance air connectivity between us and help to foster people-to-people contact.
An important aspect of our relationship is our cooperation in Science and Technology, and in Research and Innovation.
In this context, I welcome the Agreement concluded today on mobility of young scientists and researchers.
It is my hope and expectation that your next visit to India would not be such a brief one!
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing the Joint Interpretative Declaration (JID) between India and Colombia regarding the existing Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments between India and Colombia signed on November 10, 2009.
Joint Interpretative Declarations/Statements in general play an important supplementary role in strengthening the investment treaty regime.
With increasing Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) disputes, issuance of such statements is likely to have strong persuasive value before arbitration tribunals.
Such pro-active approach by partners can foster a more predictable and coherent reading of treaty terms by arbitration tribunals.
Animals, birds, flora – nature in its entirety, is filled with the joys of the season.
Crops, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electricity, communication links – everything gets affected.
A 24×7 control room helpline number 1078 is functioning continuously to deal with the flood situation.
Aapada Mitra, or Friends during Disaster were identified at various places and these were then trained in the Do’s and Don’ts; volunteers were enlisted, and a people’s organisation set up to work in this situation.
Whenever I prepare myself for ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I find that the citizens of our country prepare themselves even more.
Could you please elaborate whether its results after one month are matching the expectations of the Government?
The lofty dream of One Nation – One Tax has finally been fulfilled.
But very few people know the fact that the slogan, ‘Quit India’ was coined by Dr. Yusuf Meher Ali.
The heroes of our freedom struggle with their single-minded devotion did a ‘Tapasya’, endured hardships, made great sacrifices and even laid down their lives; what greater inspiration could there be!
The ‘Quit India Movement’ was an important milestone in the Indian Freedom Movement.
In the ‘Non-Cooperation Movement’ of 1920 and the ‘Quit India Movement’ of 1942, two different personas of Mahatma Gandhi can be seen.
The reason for this entire success was the people’s support, people’s resolve, and people’s struggle.
Everyone has tried to rid the country of its problems in one’s own way.
Five years from now, we will celebrate 75 years of India’s Independence.
The need for today is not ‘Do or Die’, instead it is to resolve, to come together, persevere, and work relentlessly with our utmost strength towards the making of a new India.
Come let’s launch a mega campaign Sankalp se Siddhi – Attainment through Resolve, from the 9th of this August.
Every Indian, social organisations, Local Self-Government Institutions, schools, colleges, various organizations – all should take one resolve or the other for a New India.
I would particularly like to call upon the online world, since wherever we may be, we are almost always online; so I would like to invite the online community and specially my young friends to come forward and contribute innovatively for building of the New India.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, as the nation’s ‘Pradhan Sewak’, I get an opportunity to communicate with the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
I have tried to draw these rules for myself, but I don’t know whether I’ll be able to stick to them.
Let’s see whether I succeed or not.
Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Utsav, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Pooja, Diwali – these will be observed one after the other.
And the ‘I’ gets an opportunity to transform into a ‘We’.
A variety of Rakhis are made in a whole range of materials, from ‘khadi’ to silken threads.
125 years and 1.25 billion countrymen!
And we must think anew ways to steer Community Ganesh Festivals in consonance with the sentiments of Tilak ji.
This should be the endeavor of all of us.
This week I had the opportunity to meet our daughters, the members of our Women’s Cricket team.
Distinguished Guests from India and abroad
A very good morning to all of you.
I am happy to be here once again with you at the Global Business Summit.
Let me first compliment you for choosing the word Social as the first word of your theme for a business summit;
I am also happy to note that the people present here are discussing thechallenge of how to make development sustainable, which happens to be the second word of your theme.
And when you talk about Scalability which is the third word of the theme for this summit, it gives me hope and confidence that you are indeed discussing solutions for India.
Who would know better than all of you present here about the challenges the country was facing during the second half of 2013 and early 2014;
Run-away inflation was breaking the back of every house-hold.
Increasing current account deficit and higher fiscal deficit were threateningthe macro-economic stability of the country.
All these parameters were indicating a gloomy future;
The country was facing total policy paralysis.
This was preventing the economy from reaching the level which it was worthy of;
The global fraternity was worried about the health of this member of fragile five club.
There was a perception of surrender to existing circumstances
It was in this background that our government came to serve the people and today change is clearly visible.
After 2014,hesitations have been replaced by hope.
Obstacles have been replaced by optimism.
Since 2014,India has made significant improvements in almost all international rankings and indices.
This not only shows how India is changing but also represents how the world’s perception about India is changing.
I am aware that there are some who cannot appreciate this rapid improvement.
They suggest that rankings only improve things on paper, but nothing changes on the ground.
I think this is far from the truth.
Rankings are mostly lagging indicators.
Things change on ground first, but reflect in rankings after a time lag.
Take the example of Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Our rankings have improved from 142 to a historic high of 77 in four years.
But the change in rankings has been preceded by improvement in situation on the ground.
Even for the small traders, compliance is getting easier.
Now a business with a turn-over of upto Rupees forty lakh does not have to register for GST.
Now a business with a turn-over of upto Rupees sixty lakh does not have to pay any income tax.
Now a business with a turnover of upto Rupees 1.5 crore is eligible for the composition scheme with very nominal tax rate.
In the same way, India’s ranking in the World Travel and TourismCompetitiveness index has gone up from sixty five in 2013 to forty in 2017.
This surge in innovation is clearly visible.
This improvement in culture is also visible.
The number of patents and trade-marks filed also show a great increase.
I would like to give you such an interesting example of how things have changed since 2014.
We are now witnessing various forms of competition.
A competition between ministries,
a competition between states,
a competition on development,
a competition on achieving targets.
Today, there is a competition as to whether India will get 100% sanitation first or 100% electrification first.
There is competition as to whether all habitations will be connected by road first or all homes will get gas connection first.
There is competition as to which state will attract more investment.
Before 2014 also, we heard of about a competition, although of a different kind.
A competition between ministries,
There was competition on who can do maximum corruption,
There was competition as to whether coal will get more money or spectrum.
I will leave it to you to decide which form of competition you would prefer.
For decades,a narrative was made that certain things are just impossible in India.
The progress our nation has achieved since 2014 gives me confidence that nothing is impossible for 130 crore Indians.
It was said that a corruption free government in India was impossible, but people of India have made it possible.
It was said that it is impossible to remove corruption from the process of giving people their due, but people of India are making it possible.
It was said that it is impossible for the poor to leverage the power of technology, but the people of India are making it possible.
It was said that removing discretion and arbitrariness in policy making was impossible, but people of India are making it possible.
It was said that governments cannot be pro-growth and pro-poor at the same time,but people of India are making it possible.
I have also been told, that there is a perception or theory that a developing economy cannot grow at higher rate for a longer period, without facing the problem of inflation;
As a result of this we never had sustainable higher rate of growth.
With these changes and reforms, transformation is happening in the way our economy has moved.
The Indian economy has expanded the bouquet of its financing resources.
It is no more dependent on banks credit for investment needs.
Take the example of fund raising from the capital market.
In the last four years, this average is about rupees forty three thousand crore per annum.
This is almost three times.
The total amount raised by Alternative Investment Funds during 2011 to 2014 was less than rupees four thousand crore.
This is a jump of the order of twenty times.
Similarly let us see the example of private placement of corporate bonds.
The average amount of fund raised through this during 2011 to 2014 was about rupees three lakh crore or about forty billion dollars.
Now the average over the last four years has gone up to rupees five point two five lakh crore or about seventy five billion dollars.
This is a jump of almost seventy five percent.
All these are examples of confidence shown in the Indian economy.
Today this confidence is shown not only by domestic investors, but also by investors from all across the world.
And the confidence shown in India continues, breaking the earlier trend of pre-election years.
In the last four years, the amount of Foreign Direct Investment received in the country was almost equal to what was received in seven years before 2014.
To achieve all this, India needed reforms to transform.
And by having the Bankruptcy Code, GST, Real Estate Act to name a few, – a solid foundation for decades of higher growth has been laid.
Four years ago, who would have believed that rupees three lakh crore or about forty billion dollars would be returned by defaulting borrowers to financial and operational creditors.
This is the impact of Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code.
This will help the country in allocating financial resources more efficiently.
Our vision of new India caters to all sections of the society, irrespective of their economic profile, their caste, creed, language and religion.
We are working hard to create a New India which fulfils the aspirations and dreams of 130 crore Indians.
Our vision of new India includes addressing the challenges of the future while also solving problems of the past.
So today, while India has made its fastest train, it has also eliminated all un-manned railway crossings.
Today, while India is building a 100 smart cities across the country, it is also ensuring rapid progress in over 100 aspirational districts.
Today, while India has become a net exporter of electricity, it has also ensured that crores of households which were in darkness since independence have got electricity.
Today, while India aims to land on Mars, it is also ensuring that every Indian has a roof over his head.
We have moved away from the A,B,C mentality – that is
“A” for avoiding,
“B” for burying and
Instead of avoiding an issue, we dealt with the issue;
Instead of confusing the system, we demonstrated that a solution is possible.
This has given us the confidence to further upscale our positive interventions in the social sector.
We are reaching out to twelve crore small and marginal farmers by providing them a comfort of rupees six thousand every year.
This will transfer 7.5 lakh crore rupees or about one hundred billion dollars to our farmers over the next ten years.
We are rolling out a pension scheme for crores of our informal sector workers.
and other providing physical infrastructure for all and particularly for generation next to shape their future as per their dreams.
The extent and magnitude of our contribution will surprise the world.
Innovation and Technology will form the bed-rock of this
The outcomes of our focus on Digital India, Start-up India, Make In India and Innovate India are converging and reaping rich dividends.
This is a three fold increase!
This is almost a four fold increase!
You would be happy to know that today 44 percent of the startups registered in India are from tier 2 and tier3 cities?
A network of hundreds of Atal Tinkering Labs is coming up across the country and helping foster an atmosphere of innovation.
This will give a solid foundation for our students to help them become innovators of tomorrow.
I was impressed to see how a young girl from the snake charmer community was literally charming the mouse and making the most of digital India.
It is equally heartening to see how youth in villages are leveraging Wi-Fi and digital tools to help in clearing competitive exams.
It is technology which is bridging the gap between the haves and have-nots in our country.
Stories like these are writing a new chapter in the history of India.
With the support and partnership of the people, India has made rapid strides since 2014.
This could not have been possible without Jan Bhagidaari.
It is this experience that gives us confidence that our country can provide adequate opportunities to all its citizens, to grow, prosper and excel.
We look forward to making India a ten trillion dollar economy,
We look forward to making India the third largest economy,
We want to make an India of countless startups,
We want to lead the global drive towards renewable sources of energy,
We want to give our people energy security
We want to cut down on import dependence;
We want to make India a world leader in electric vehicles and energy storage devices.
With these goals in mind, let us re-dedicate ourselves to create a New India of our dreams.
Thank You Very Much.
At the outset, I express my condolences and sympathies to the families of all those, who have lost their loved ones, or faced immense hardship in the recent incidents of heavy rain and floods in Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu.
I have assured the State Government of all possible support.
Their stellar efforts over the last seven and a half decades, have made Thanthi one of the biggest media brands.
Not just in the State of Tamil Nadu, but in the entire country.
I also compliment the management and staff of the Thanthi group for this success.
24 hour news channels are now available to millions of Indians.
Yet, for many, the day still begins with a cup of tea or coffee in one hand, and a newspaper in the other.
I am told that the Dina Thanthi offers this option today, through seventeen editions, not only in Tamil Nadu but also in Bengaluru, Mumbai and even in Dubai.
This remarkable expansion over seventy five years, is a tribute to the visionary leadership of Thiru S.P. Adithanar, who began this newspaper in 1942.
The font size, simple language and easy to understand narrative made Dina Thanthi popular among the people.
In those times, it brought them political awareness and information.
People used to throng the tea-shops to read this newspaper.
I came to know that Thanthi means telegram.
Dina Thanthi means “daily telegram”.
Over the last seventy five years, the traditional telegram, delivered by the postal department, has become obsolete, and gone out of existence.
But this telegram, continues to grow every day.
Such is the power of a noble idea, backed by hard work and commitment.
I am sure, this recognition will be a motivating factor for those who have taken to writing as a noble profession.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Mankind’s quest for knowledge is as old as our history itself.
Journalism helps quench this thirst.
Today, newspapers do not just give news.
They can also mould our thinking and open a window to the world.
In a broader context, media is a means of transforming society.
That is why, we refer to the media, as the fourth pillar of democracy.
I am fortunate today, to be among those who demonstrate the power of the pen, and show how it can be the vital life-force and conscience of society.
During the dark days of colonialism, publications such as the Sambad Kaumudi of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the Kesari of Lokmanya Tilak, and the Navjeevan of Mahatma Gandhi, lit a beacon, and inspired the freedom struggle.
Across the country, there were pioneers in journalism, who often gave up a life of comfort.
They helped create a mass consciousness and awakening, through their newspapers.
Perhaps it is because of the high ideals of those founding pioneers, that so many newspapers established in the days of the British Raj, continue to flourish today.
We must never forget that successive generations performed the duties required of them, towards society, and the nation.
That is how we achieved freedom.
After independence, the rights of citizens gained importance in public discourse.
Unfortunately, over time we seem to have neglected our individual and collective sense of duty.
This has in some way contributed to several ills that plague our society today.
The need of the hour is to create a mass awakening towards “engaged, responsible, and aware citizens.”
The civic sense of “entitlement” must be suitably balanced by a civic sense of “responsible engagement.”
This should happen, of course, through our education system, and the conduct of our political leaders.
But the media too, has a key role to play here.
Many of the newspapers that shaped the discourse for freedom, were vernacular newspapers.
In fact, the then British Government was fearful of the Indian Vernacular Press.
It was to muzzle vernacular newspapers, that the Vernacular Press Act was enacted in 1878.
In our diverse nation, the role of vernacular newspapers – newspapers published in regional languages – remains as important today, as it was then.
They carry content in a language that is easily understood by people.
Very often, they cater to vulnerable and socially disadvantaged groups.
Their strength, their impact, and thus, their responsibility, can never be under-estimated.
They are the messengers of the intent and policies of the Government, in far-flung areas.
Equally, they are the torch-bearers of the thoughts, feelings and emotions of our people.
In this context, it is indeed heartening to note that today, among our vibrant print media, some of the largest selling newspapers, are published in the regional languages.
The Dina Thanthi, is of course, one among them.
On a serious note, we are all aware, that there is just too much that happens in the world everyday.
It is the editors who select and decide what is important.
They decide what should be given space on the first page, what should be given more space and what should be ignored.
This, of course, casts upon them, a great responsibility.
Editorial freedom must be used wisely, in public interest.
Equally so, the freedom to write, and to decide what is to be written, does not include the freedom to be “less than accurate,” or “factually incorrect.”
As Mahatma Gandhi himself told us: “The press is called the Fourth Estate.
It is definitely a power, but, to misuse that power is criminal.”
Even though media may be owned by private individuals, it serves a public purpose.
As scholars say, it is an instrument to produce reform through peace, rather than by force.
Hence, it has as much social accountability as the elected government or the judiciary.
And its conduct must be equally, above board.
To recall the words of the great saint Thiruvalluvar, “There is nothing in this world except ethics, which would bring both reputation and wealth together”.
Technology has brought about great change in the media.
There was a time, when the headlines of the day, written on a village blackboard, carried immense credibility.
Today, our media spans the entire range, from that village blackboard, to online bulletin boards.
Just as education now focuses a lot more on learning outcomes, our attitude towards consumption of content has changed.
Today, every citizen analyses, discusses, and attempts to cross-check and verify the news that comes to him, through multiple sources.
Media, therefore, must make an extra effort, to maintain credibility.
Healthy competition among credible media platforms is also good for the health of our democracy.
Renewed emphasis on credibility, brings us to the subject of introspection.
I firmly believe that reform in the media, whenever required, can only come from within, through introspection.
Perhaps, it should happen more often.
It is only fair that politics be discussed at length, in a democracy.
However, India is more than just us politicians.
It is the 125 crore Indians, which make India what it is.
I would be happy to see media focus a lot more, on their stories, and their achievements.
In this endeavour, every citizen with a mobile phone is your ally.
Citizen reporting can be an important tool in the sharing and dissemination of success stories of individuals.
It can also be of immense help in directing relief and rescue efforts in times of crisis, or natural disasters.
Let me also add, that during times of natural disasters, media usually does its best to cover various aspects of the incident.
Natural calamities seem to be occurring with increasing frequency and intensity across the world.
Climate change is a challenge for each one of us.
Can media take a lead in the battle against it?
Can media devote just a little space, or a fixed time daily, to report, discuss, or increase awareness about what we can do to combat climate change?
I take this opportunity, to appreciate the media’s response to the Swachh Bharat Mission.
As we strive to achieve Swachh Bharat by 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, I am touched by the constructive role that media has played, both in generating awareness and mass consciousness towards cleanliness.
They have also pointed out the work that remains to be done, before we can claim to have achieved our goal.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
There is another key area, where media can play an important role.
This is the initiative of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
Let me explain this with one example.
Every day, they can write one simple sentence in their language of publication, along with its translation, and trans-literation, in all major Indian languages.
At the end of the year, the readers of the newspaper will have been exposed to 365 such simple sentences, in all major Indian languages.
Imagine the positive impact this simple step can create.
Hence, this step will not only serve a noble cause, but will also increase the strength of the publication itself.
Seventy five years may be a considerable amount of time in a human life-span.
But for a nation, or an institution, it marks just a significant milestone.
About three months ago, we celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement.
In a way, the journey of the Dina Thanthi, has mirrored the rise of India as a young, vibrant nation.
Speaking in Parliament on that day, I gave a call for creating a New India by 2022.
An India that is free from the evils of corruption, casteism, communalism, poverty, illiteracy, and disease.
The next five years must be about Sankalp se Siddhi – accomplishment through resolve.
Only then can we create the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters.
As a newspaper that was born when the nation embraced the Quit India Movement, may I suggest that the Dina Thanthi has a special responsibility in this regard.
I hope that you will use this opportunity, to reflect upon what you can do for your readers, or for the people of India, over the next five years.
Even beyond the immediate target of five years, perhaps on the occasion of its platinum jubilee, the Thanthi must think of what the next seventy five years will be like.
What is the best way to continue to remain relevant, and serve the people and the nation in the age of instant news at the fingertips.
And in doing so, continue to maintain the highest standards of professionalism, ethics, and objectivity.
In conclusion, I once again appreciate the efforts of the publishers of Dina Thanthi in the service of the people of Tamil Nadu.
I am sure, they will continue to constructively help in shaping the destiny of our great nation.
My dear citizens
I hope you ended the festive season of Diwali with joy and new hope.
Today, I will be speaking to you about some critical issues and important decisions.
Today I want to make a special request to all of you.
You may recall the economic situation in May 2014 when you entrusted us with an onerous responsibility.
In the context of BRICS, it was being said that the “I” in BRICS was shaky.
Since then, we had two years of severe drought.
Yet, in the last two and a half years with the support of 125 crore Indians, India has become the “bright spot” in the global economy.
This Government is dedicated to the poor.
It will remain dedicated to them.
In our fight against poverty, our main thrust has been to empower the poor, and make them active participants in the benefits of economic progress.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana,
the Jan Suraksha Yojana,
the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana for small enterprises,
the Stand-up India programme for Dalits, Adivasis and Women,
the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Scheme for gas connections in the homes of the poor,
In the past decades, the spectre of corruption and black money has grown.
It has weakened the effort to remove poverty.
On the one hand, we are now No. 1 in the rate of economic growth.
But on the other hand, we were ranked close to one hundred in the global corruption perceptions ranking two years back.
In spite of many steps taken, we have only been able to reach a ranking of seventy-six now.
Of course, there is improvement.
This shows the extent to which corruption and black money have spread their tentacles.
The evil of corruption has been spread by certain sections of society for their selfish interest.
They have ignored the poor and cornered benefits.
Some people have misused their office for personal gain.
On the other hand, honest people have fought against this evil.
Crores of common men and women have lived lives of integrity.
We hear about poor auto-rickshaw drivers returning gold ornaments left in the vehicles to their rightful owners.
We hear about taxi drivers who take pains to locate the owners of cell phones left behind.
We hear of vegetable vendors who return excess money given by customers.
There comes a time in the history of a country’s development when a need is felt for a strong and decisive step.
For years, this country has felt that corruption, black money and terrorism are festering sores, holding us back in the race towards development.
Terrorism is a frightening threat.
So many have lost their lives because of it.
But have you ever thought about how these terrorists get their money?
Enemies from across the border run their operations using fake currency notes.
This has been going on for years.
• a law was passed in 2015 for disclosure of foreign black money;
• agreements with many countries, including the USA, have been made to add provisions for sharing banking information;
• a strict law has come into force from August 2016 to curb benami transactions, which are used to deploy black money earned through corruption;
• a scheme was introduced for declaring black money after paying a stiff penalty;
Through all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, we have brought into the open nearly 1 lakh 25 thousand crore rupees of black money belonging to the corrupt.
Honest citizens want this fight against corruption, black money, benami property, terrorism and counterfeiting to continue.
The magnitude of cash in circulation is directly linked to the level of corruption.
Inflation becomes worse through the deployment of cash earned in corrupt ways.
The poor have to bear the brunt of this.
It has a direct effect on the purchasing power of the poor and the middle class.
You may yourself have experienced when buying land or a house, that apart from the amount paid by cheque, a large amount is demanded in cash.
This creates problems for an honest person in buying property.
The misuse of cash has led to artificial increase in the cost of goods and services like houses, land, higher education, health care and so on.
High circulation of cash also strengthens the hawala trade which is directly connected to black money and illegal trade in weapons.
Debate on the role of black money in elections has been going on for years.
To break the grip of corruption and black money, we have decided that the five hundred rupee and thousand rupee currency notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight, that is 8th November 2016.
This means that these notes will not be acceptable for transactions from midnight onwards.
The five hundred and thousand rupee notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become just worthless pieces of paper.
The rights and the interests of honest, hard-working people will be fully protected.
Let me assure you that notes of one hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, two and one rupee and all coins will remain legal tender and will not be affected.
This step will strengthen the hands of the common man in the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency.
To minimise the difficulties of citizens in the coming days, several steps are being taken.
1. Persons holding old notes of five hundred or one thousand rupees can deposit these notes in their bank or post office accounts from 10th November till close of banking hours on 30th December 2016 without any limit.
2. Thus you will have 50 days to deposit your notes and there is no need for panic.
3. Your money will remain yours.
You need have no worry on this point.
4. After depositing your money in your account, you can draw it when you need it.
5. Keeping in mind the supply of new notes, in the first few days, there will be a limit of ten thousand rupees per day and twenty thousand rupees per week.
This limit will be increased in the coming days.
6. Apart from depositing your notes in your bank account, another facility will also be there.
7. For your immediate needs, you can go to any bank, head post office or sub post office, show your identity proof like Aadhaar card, voter card, ration card, passport, PAN card or other approved proofs, and exchange your old five hundred or thousand rupee notes for new notes.
8. From 10th November till 24th November the limit for such exchange will be four thousand rupees.
From 25th November till 30th December, the limit will be increased.
9. There may be some who, for some reason, are not able to deposit their old five hundred or thousand rupee notes by 30th December 2016.
10. They can go to specified offices of the Reserve Bank of India up to 31st March 2017 and deposit the notes after submitting a declaration form.
11. On 9th November and in some places on 10th November also, ATMs will not work.
In the first few days, there will be a limit of two thousand rupees per day per card.
12. This will be raised to four thousand rupees later.
13. Five hundred and thousand rupee notes will not be legal tender from midnight.
However for humanitarian reasons, to reduce hardship to citizens, some special arrangements have been made for the first 72 hours, that is till midnight on 11th November.
14. During this period, government hospitals will continue to accept five hundred and thousand rupee notes for payment.
15. This is for the benefit of those families whose members may be unwell.
16. Pharmacies in government hospitals will also accept these notes for buying medicines with doctors’ prescription.
18. For 72 hours, five hundred and thousand rupee notes will be accepted also at
• Petrol, diesel and CNG gas stations authorised by public sector oil companies
• Consumer co-operative stores authorised by State or Central Government
• Milk booths authorised by State governments
• Crematoria and burial grounds.
These outlets will have to keep proper records of stock and collections.
19. Arrangements will be made at international airports for arriving and departing passengers who have five hundred or thousand rupee notes of not more than five thousand rupees, to exchange them for new notes or other legal tender.
20. Foreign tourists will be able to exchange foreign currency or old notes of not more than Rs 5000 into legal tender.
21. One more thing I would like to mention, I want to stress that in this entire exercise, there is no restriction of any kind on non-cash payments by cheques, demand drafts, debit or credit cards and electronic fund transfer.
In spite of all these efforts there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens.
Experience tells us that ordinary citizens are always ready to make sacrifices and face difficulties for the benefit of the nation.
I see that spirit when a poor widow gives up her LPG subsidy, when a retired school teacher contributes his pension to the Swacch Bharat mission, when a poor Adivasi mother sells her goats to build a toilet, when a soldier contributes 57 thousand rupees to make his village clean.
I have seen that the ordinary citizen has the determination to do anything, if it will lead to the country’s progress.
So, in this fight against corruption, black money, fake notes and terrorism, in this movement for purifying our country, will our people not put up with difficulties for some days?
I have full confidence that every citizen will stand up and participate in this ‘mahayagna’.
My dear countrymen, after the festivity of Diwali, now join the nation and extend your hand in this Imandaari ka Utsav, this Pramanikta ka Parv, this celebration of integrity, this festival of credibility.
I am sure that all political parties, all governments, social services organizations, the media and indeed all sections of the society will take part in this with enthusiasm and make it a success.
Secrecy was essential for this action.
It is only now, as I speak to you, that various agencies like banks, post offices, railways, hospitals and others are being informed.
The Reserve Bank, banks and post offices have to make many arrangements at very short notice.
Obviously, time will be needed.
Therefore all banks will be closed to the public on 9th November.
This may cause some hardship to you.
I have full faith that banks and post offices will successfully carry out this great task of national importance.
However, I appeal to all of you to help the banks and post offices to meet this challenge with poise and determination.
My dear citizens,
From time to time, based on currency needs, the Reserve Bank with the approval of the Central Government brings out new notes of higher value.
In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a recommendation for issue of five thousand and ten thousand rupee notes.
After careful consideration, this was not accepted.
Now as part of this exercise, RBI’s recommendation to issue two thousand rupee notes has been accepted.
New notes of five hundred rupees and two thousand rupees, with completely new design will be introduced.
Based on past experience, the Reserve Bank will hereafter make arrangements to limit the share of high denomination notes in the total currency in circulation.
In a country’s history, there come moments when every person feels he too should be part of that moment, that he too should make his contribution to the country’s progress.
Such moments come but rarely.
Now, we again have an opportunity where every citizen can join this mahayajna against the ills of corruption, black money and fake notes.
The more help you give in this campaign, the more successful it will be.
It has been a matter of concern for all of us that corruption and black money tend to be accepted as part of life.
This type of thinking has afflicted our politics, our administration and our society like an infestation of termites.
None of our public institutions is free from these termites.
Let us ignore the temporary hardship
Let us join this festival of integrity and credibility
Let us enable coming generations to live their lives with dignity
Let us fight corruption and black money
Let us ensure that the nation’s wealth benefits the poor
Let us enable law-abiding citizens to get their due share.
I am confident in the 125 crore people of India and I am sure country will get success.

Today, I am delighted to be in Mozambique as my first destination in mainland Africa.
Our shared struggles and suffering under colonial oppression brought our two countries together.
India was one of the strongest supporters of Mozambican independence.
But, it is not about the past history alone.
We are also strengthening our partnership in food security.
India will be donating essential medicines for the Mozambican public health system, including medicines for treatment of AIDS.
We want our development and economic ties to benefit our societies.
We also want our partnership to ensure the safety and security of our people.
Our agreement on prevention of drug trafficking is a testimony to our shared determination to combat this menace and these networks.
India and Mozambique are connected by the Indian Ocean.

Our cooperation is not just for our common prosperity.
We are also mindful of the larger regional and global good.
We have stood with each other in the international arena on a range of issues.
In Mozambique’s march towards economic prosperity, India will walk every step of the way.
We will be a trusted friend in your development.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the payment of Productivity Linked Bonus (PLB) equivalent to 78 days’ wages for the financial year 2017-18 for all eligible non-gazetted Railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel).
The financial implication of payment of 78 days’ PLB to railway employees has been estimated to be Rs.2044.31 crore.
The wage calculation ceiling prescribed for payment of PLB to the eligible non-gazetted railway employees is Rs.7000/- p.m.
The maximum amount payable per eligible railway employee is Rs.17,951 for 78 days.
About 11.91 lakh non-gazetted Railway employees are likely to benefit from the decision.
The Productivity Linked Bonus on Railway covers all non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) who are spread over the entire country.
Payment of PLB to eligible railway employees is made each year before the Dusshera/ Puja holidays.
The decision of the Cabinet shall be implemented before the holidays for this year as well.
For the year 2017-18 PLB equivalent to 78 days’ wages will be paid which is expected to motivate the employees for working towards improving the performance of the Railways.
Railways were the first departmental undertaking of the Government of India wherein the concept of PLB was introduced in the year 1979-80.
The main consideration at that time was the important role of the Railways as an infrastructural support in the performance of the economy as a whole.
In the overall context of Railway working, it was considered desirable to introduce the concept of PLB as against the concept of Bonus on the lines of ‘The Payment of Bonus Act – 1965’.

India is grateful to him for his role in freedom struggle and decisive leadership”, the Prime Minister said.
“Today on Earth Day, we bow in reverence to Mother Earth.
For years, this great planet has been home to phenomenal diversity.
Today we also reiterate our commitment to work towards the well-being of our planet, focus on sustainable development and mitigating climate change.”
Was pleased to visit Haifa and pay homage there in person in July”, the Prime Minister said.
“On Arunachal Pradesh’s Statehood Day, my greetings to people of the state.
I pray for the state’s overall development in the coming years.
My best wishes to the new Government of Arunachal Pradesh in fulfilling the expectations and aspirations of the people.
Best wishes to the wonderful people of Mizoram on their Statehood Day.
May Mizoram scale new heights of progress in the years to come”, the Prime Minister said.
Yesterday, I went to pay homage to respected Bapu at Rajghat.
Every year we pay tributes to the martyrs on this day.
Observing 2 minutes silence at sharp 11 A.M. is an occasion to express our gratitude to great and brave men, sages and saints who have laid down their lives for the country.
However if we see, there would be many among us who won’t have maintained this 2 minutes silence.
I know that this will not happen with just one Mann Ki Baat.
Well, as you knowBapu was a supporter of science, so I also used technology as a medium to reach these lakhs of brothers and sisters.
My greetings to the people associated with khadi for their earnest efforts to bring something new in khadi.
Market has its own importance in the economy.
In addition to the emotional value, it is important that khadi makes a mark in the market itself.
When I told people that you have so many different types of garments, then you should have khadi as well.
Khadi has the potential to provide employment to millions.
Few days ago, Railway Ministry, Police Department, Indian Navy, Postal Department of Uttarakhand and many such government organizations took intiatives to promote the use of khadi.
Respected Bapu was always aware and insistent of technological up-gradation and also remained in the forefront for the same.
And this is why, with constant development, our ‘Charkha’ has arrived to where it is now.
Running charkha with solar and linking solar energy with Charkha have become a successful experiment.
I have received many letters especially on the solar charkha.
All these things adds to enthusiasm.
Fellow Citizens, we all celebrated the 26th January with a lot of zeal and enthusiasm.
Braving the terror threats, citizens of our country showed courage and celebrated the Republic Day with pride and dignity.
But some people came out with an out of the box thinking.
The two states selected the most educated girls from every village to do the flag hosting in government run schools in the states.
Haryana and Gujarat gave importance to the girls, provided special importance to the educated girls.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao – they made an effort and sent a good message.
I congratulate the imagination of these two states and also congratulate all those girls who got the opportunity to host the flag.
The number of girl child went down in proportion to thousand males.
It was a huge concern as social balance was in danger.
And when I picked Haryana, many of our officers told me to do away with that, saying there was a huge negative atmosphere in the state.
In the last edition of Mann Ki Baat I talked about two things.
Few people perhaps do not give information due to hesitation.
Well, I don’t want to embroil into this controversy.
However, the biggest crisis of farmers is the sheer waste of their efforts in the natural disaster.
His year goes waste.
There is only one solution that is to provide security to farmers and that is Fasal Beema Yojana.
Government of India has given a very big gift to the farmers in 2016 – ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana’.
But this is not meant to praise the scheme and the Prime Minister.
Can we pledge to reach out to at least 50 percent of the country’s farmers with the crop insurance over the next 1-2 years.
I need your help in this exercise.
If a farmer gets linked to the crop insurance scheme, he gets a big help in the times of crisis.
Focus has been on using the technology to fast track it and ensure there is no delay in receiving the insurance claims.
On the top of it, the insurance premium rate has been slashed to its lowest level which no one would have ever thought of.
In the new insurance scheme for the farmers, the maximum limit of premium would be 2 percent for kharif and 1.5 percent for the rabi crops.
And tell me, if any of my farmer brothers is deprived of the scheme, then will it be damaging for him or not?
You may not be a farmer, but must be listening to Mann ki Baat.
Will you make my voice reach the farmers?
And therefore I want that you promote it the most.
And for this, I have also brought a new scheme.
I want that my talks regarding Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana reaches the masses.
And it is right that you are listening to my Mann Ki Baat on TV and radio.
But what if you have to listen to it later?
Just give a missed call and you will be able to listen to Maan Ki Baat whenever you want to.
As of now, it is in Hindi.
But very soon, you would get the opportunity to listen to Mann Ki Baat in your mother tongue.
I will arrange for this as well.
My dear youngsters, you have done a commendable job.
I experienced new energy, new consciousness, new zeal and new vigour during the start-up program, which was held on January 16.
Lakhs of people had registered to attend this event.
However due to space constraint, the program was eventually held in Vigyan Bhawan.
Start-up also brings innumerable opportunities.
I visited Sikkim few days ago.
If our animals get good feed, then we will get good milk.
And if we get good milk, then the young people of our country will be powerful.
Manoj Gilda, Nikhilji have started agri-storage start-up.
They are developing the bulk storage system for agricultural products with scientific fruits storage system.
Means lots of suggestions have come.
My dear countrymen, cleanliness is also getting associated with beauty.
Now people of the country have started discussion on cleanliness, leaving behind the filth.
And somewhere or the other, something or the other work is happening on cleanliness.
But now, people have marched one step ahead in the initiative.
I see that many local people, local artists, students are engaged in decorating the railway stations of their cities.
Keeping the local art at the centre, painting the walls, making artistic sign boards with content to keep people aware, and so many other things being undertaken by the people.
Someone told me that the tribal women have decrorated the Hazaribagh station with the local Sohrai and Kohbar Art design.
Sitting on the train, on the walls one can see the specialty of the place.
This was neither the initiative of the Railways nor Narendra Modi.
This was the people’s initiative.
See when people do, and how well they do.
Can you, who have take some effort of cleaning along with decoration on railway station or other places, send me the pictures?
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride that India is hosting a major event from 4th to 8th of February.
International Fleet Review is happening on the coastal region of India.
This is an effort to ensure rapport between us and world’s military power.
This is a joint exercise.
This means endless sufficency.
And our ancestors made the introduction of this power by roaming around the world, doing global trade.
Be it Chatrapati Shivaji, Chola Dynasty which made a new identity with Naval power.
This also is a good opportunity to make relations with the SAARC countries.
My dear countrymen, I had even said earlier that whatever comes to mind, I want to express it with you openly.
Final Examinations for grade 10th and 12th will be conducted in the coming days.
Last time I had shared my views with the students regarding the examinations.
You must have had good experiences.
This time you can send your experiences on Narendra Modi App.

Here’s a programme both of us attended in 2012 on Azad Hind Fauj. http://nm-4.com/t2 “, the Prime Minister said.
I am Happy to be here at Kochi the Queen of the Arabian Sea.
The blue sea, the back-waters, the Great Periyar River the greenery all around and its dynamic people make Kochi indeed a Queen among the cities.
It was from here, that the great Indian Sage Adi Shankar embarked on his epic journeys across India to protect the Indian civilization and unify the country.
Today is a historic day when the largest industrial unit of Kerala is entering its next phase of development.
It is indeed a proud moment not just for God’s Own Country but also for the entire Nation.
Bharat Petroleum’s Kochi Refinery has played a critical role in popularizing the clean fuel, LPG among masses in Kerala and neighbouring States for more than 50 years.
I recall, my childhood and youth, when I had seen many mothers struggling with the fire-wood stove in the kitchen.
Ever since, I had always thought of improving their situation and providing healthy kitchens to the mothers and sisters of India.
The Ujjwala scheme of the Government of India is a way to realize this dream.
I am happy that since May 2016, nearly six crore LPG connections have been provided to the poorest of the poor in our country under Ujjawala yojana .
More than twenty three crore LPG consumers have joined the Pahal Scheme.
Pahal has helped in identifying ghost accounts, multiple accounts and inactive accounts.
Pahal has entered into the Guinness book of World records, as the largest Direct Benefit Transfer scheme in the world.
Over one crore customers have given up LPG subsidy under ‘Give it up’ initiative.
By doubling the LPG production with the help of the recent expansion, Kochi Refinery is making a great contribution towards Ujjwala.
The National Gas Grid or Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga has also been created to have a gas based economy and enhance the share of gas in the energy basket.
The Government has thought of developing additional fifteen thousand Kilo-Miters of gas pipeline network.
To cut down on import of Crude oil, government has taken decisive steps towards reducing imports by ten percent and saving precious foreign exchange.
To this end, the 2nd Generation ethanol through lignocellulose Route has been adopted by Oil PSUs for establishing twelve 2G ethanol plants in 11 States.
The Indian refinery industry has done well in establishing itself as a major player globally.
India, which is second largest oil refiner in Asia, is emerging as a refinery hub with refining more than its demand.
Last but not the least I recognize the work of all those labourers who worked day and night during construction.
I am told that at the peak of the project, over twenty thousand labourers were working at the site.
In many ways, they are the ‘Real Heroes’ of the Project.
The Integrated Refinery Expansion Project was also a strategic move of Bharat Petroleum to diversify into non-fuel sector.
These niche petro-chemicals will find use in paints, inks, coating, detergent, and in many other articles.
Now, BPCL is starting the construction of a Petro-chemical Complex where it would produce polyols that find end use in foams, fibres, foot-wear, cosmetics, and medicines.
I am sure by all these, many ancillary industries would come to Kochi.
I hope the Petro-chemical Park planned by State Government would become operational soon and leverage the business opportunities provided by the Petro-chemical venture of BPCL.
I am happy to note that BPCL along with other PSUs has set up a Skill Development Institute for skilling and developing employable youth.
I am delighted to lay the foundation stone of the second campus of the institute at Ettumanoor near the holy Mahadeva Temple.
I am also glad to note that Indian Oil Corporation has put out the Mounded Storage Facility at its Cochin Bottling Plant, around 12 kilo-metres from here at a cost of Rupees fifty crores.
It is heartening to note that last August, when Kerala was passing through the worst floods in a hundred years, BPCL Kochi Refinery was kept running against all odds.
I understand that many employees stayed in the refinery to ensure continuous production of petrol, diesel and LPG.
This helped the rescue vehicles and heli-copters to continue relief and rescue operation smoothly.
The MoU was signed on 22.6.2016 during the visit of a delegation led by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to Switzerland from 20th – 22nd June, 2016.
The MoU broadly focuses on capacity building and exchange of best practices in the area of skill development.
Your accomplishments make us very proud.”, the Prime Minister said.
In a major policy drive to give a boost to petroleum and hydrocarbon sector, the Government has unveiled a series of initiatives.
The Union Cabinet and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in its meeting today has taken the following decisions –
1. Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy, HELP: An innovative Policy for future which provides for a uniform licensing system to cover all hydrocarbons such as oil, gas, coal bed methane etc. under a single licensing framework.
2. Marketing and Pricing freedom for new gas production from Deepwater, Ultra Deepwater and High Pressure-High Temperature Areas.
Over the years, various problems and issues have arisen.
Presently, there are separate policies and licenses for different hydrocarbons.
This fragmented policy framework leads to inefficiencies in exploiting natural resources.
For example, while exploring for one type of hydrocarbon, if a different one is found, it will need separate licensing, adding to cost.
Another feature of the current system is that exploration is confined to blocks which have been put on tender by the Government.
There are situations where exploration companies may themselves have information or interest regarding other areas where they may like to pursue exploration.
The country currently faces a situation where oil and gas constitutes a major and increasing share of total imports.
Oil production has stagnated while gas production has declined.
There is a need for concerted policy measures to stimulate domestic production.
· There will be a uniform licensing system which will cover all hydrocarbons, i.e. oil, gas, coal bed methane etc. under a single license and policy framework.
· Contracts will be based on “biddable revenue sharing”.
In terms of macro-economic impact and also in terms of energy security, it is of paramount importance that domestic production of hydrocarbons be increased.
With the economy growing at over 7%, demand for petroleum products including gas is increasing.
The sector thus faces a situation of rising demand, falling production and consequently rapid increase in imports.
In this background, after extensive consultations, it was felt that rather than fixing a premium, it would be more appropriate to provide marketing and pricing freedom to the gas to be produced from the new discoveries as well as existing discoveries which are yet to commence production.
However, in order to protect user industries from market imperfections, this freedom would be accompanied by a price ceiling based on opportunity cost of imported fuels.
After a careful consideration of the country’s strategic, economic and environmental interests and interests of both producing and consuming industries, a new policy is being introduced which is balanced.
The salient features of the new policy are as follows:
· For all the discoveries in deep water/ultra-deep water/high temperature/ high pressure areas which are yet to commence commercial production as on 1.1.2016 and for all future discoveries in such areas, the producers will be allowed marketing freedom including pricing freedom.
· To protect user industries from any market imperfections, this freedom would be subject to a ceiling price on the basis of landed price of alternative fuels.
To the extent that domestic gas can be produced and sold at a price below import parity price, it will not only benefit the overall economy by boosting employment and GDP and reducing imports, but also benefit the user industry by lowering the average price.
The weighted average import landed price of substitute fuels in (ii) above will be defined as: 0.3 x price of coal + 0.4 x price of fuel oil + 0.3 x price of naphtha.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas will notify the periodic revision of gas price ceiling under these guidelines.
All gas fields currently under production will continue to be governed by the pricing regime which is currently applicable to them.
Production Enhancement:
Besides, these there would be around 20000 persons required during the construction phase.
The Director General Hydrocarbons (DGH) will make a recommendation within 6 months of submission of application by the contractor.
The Government will take a decision on the request for extension within 3 months of receipt of the proposal from DGH.
(iii) During the extended period of Contract, the royalty and cess shall be payable at prevailing rates and not at concessional rates stipulated in the contracts.
(iv) The extension of these PSCs would be considered for 10 years both for oil and gas fields or economic life of the Field, whichever is earlier.
The policy for PSC extension will lead to production of hydrocarbons beyond the present term of PSC.
The reserves which are likely to get monetized during the extended period are of the order of 15.7 MMT of oil and 20.6 MMT of Oil Equivalent of gas.
The reserves associated with this field would lead to monetization of reserves worth USD 8.25 Billion (around 53000 Crore).
The monetization of these reserves would require an additional investment of USD 3 to 4 Billion.
Employment Generation Potential:
The extension of these contracts is expected to bring extra investments in the fields and would generate both direct (related to field operations) and indirect employment (related to service industry associated with these fields).
The extension of contracts would also envisage that the present employment levels in these fields are maintained for a longer period of time.
Transparency and Minimum Government and Maximum Governance:
With a view to enable the E&P companies to take investment decisions for exploitation of the remaining reserves this extension policy has been approved so as to grant extensions in a fair and transparent manner.

This is the second major reform after the last radical changes announced in November 2015.
This is the highest ever FDI inflow for a particular financial year.
However, it is felt that the country has potential to attract far more foreign investment which can be achieved by further liberalizing and simplifying the FDI regime.
India today has been rated as Number 1 FDI Investment Destination by several International Agencies.
Accordingly the Government has decided to introduce a number of amendments in the FDI Policy.
Changes introduced in the policy include increase in sectoral caps, bringing more activities under automatic route and easing of conditionalities for foreign investment.
These amendments seek to further simplify the regulations governing FDI in the country and make India an attractive destination for foreign investors.
Details of these changes are given in the following paragraphs:
FDI above 49% is permitted through Government approval on case to case basis, wherever it is likely to result in access to modern and ‘state-of-art’ technology in the country.
In this regard, the following changes have inter-alia been brought in the FDI policy on this sector:
i. Foreign investment beyond 49% has now been permitted through government approval route, in cases resulting in access to modern technology in the country or for other reasons to be recorded.
The condition of access to ‘state-of-art’ technology in the country has been done away with.
(2)Direct to Home (DTH);
(3)Cable Networks (Multi System operators (MSOs) operating at National or State or District level and undertaking upgradation of networks towards digitalization and addressability);
5. Civil Aviation Sector
(i) The extant FDI policy on Airports permits 100% FDI under automatic route in Greenfield Projects and 74% FDI in Brownfield Projects under automatic route.
FDI beyond 74% for Brownfield Projects is under government route.
8. Animal Husbandry
As per FDI Policy 2016, FDI in Animal Husbandry (including breeding of dogs), Pisciculture, Aquaculture and Apiculture is allowed 100% under Automatic Route under controlled conditions.
It has been decided to do away with this requirement of ‘controlled conditions’ for FDI in these activities.
It has now been decided to relax local sourcing norms up to three years and a relaxed sourcing regime for another five years for entities undertaking Single Brand Retail Trading of products having ‘state-of-art’ and ‘cutting edge’ technology.
Today’s amendments to the FDI Policy are meant to liberalise and simplify the FDI policy so as to provide ease of doing business in the country leading to larger FDI inflows contributing to growth of investment, incomes and employment.

This is now similar to the MCA provisions of Highway Sector.
Under provision of additional land to the Concessionaire, land rent has been reduced from 200% to 120% of the applicable scale of rates for the proposed additional land.

The problems associated with fixing storage charges by TAMP and collection of Revenue share on storage charges which has plagued many projects will also get eliminated.
Concessionaire would be free to deploy higher capacity equipment/facilities/technology and carry out value engineering for higher productivity and improved utilization and/or cost saving of Project assets.
“Actual Project Cost” would be replaced by “Total Project Cost”.
Provision for commencement of operations before COD.

Your Excellency President Xi Jinping, my esteemed BRICS Colleagues, Distinguished Leaders
I am delighted to be here with you all today.
Your countries are close and valued partners of India.
And I am pleased to exchange perspectives with you on the shared priority of achieving comprehensive sustainable development.
I thank President Xi Jinping for bringing us together for this dialogue.
Two years since the adoption of UN’s 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the imperative of collaborative action to achieve the goals is even stronger.
The bedrock of our development agenda lies in the notion of “SabkaSaath,SabkaVikaas” – that is: Collective Effort, Inclusive Growth.
India has a long tradition of partnerships with fellow developing countries, while pursuing our own aspirations for growth.
Earlier this year, we launched the South Asia Satellite to benefit willing regional partners in meeting their developmental goals in education, healthcare, communication, and disaster management.
For over half a century, India’s flagship initiative – Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation, ITEC – has offered training and skill development to 161 partner countries from Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Caribbean and Pacific Island states.
From Africa alone, over the last decade, over 25,000 students have trained in India on ITEC scholarships.
At the Third India-Africa Forum Summit in 2015, with participation of all 54 African countries, we decided to double the number of ITEC scholarships to 50,000 over a period of only 5 years.
Our growing engagement with Africa has led to the African Development Bank holding its Annual Meeting outside Africa for the first time, in India earlier this year.
Our development partnerships projects are providing water, electricity, roads, healthcare, tele-medicine, and basic infrastructure to people in dozens of countries across the world.
And, in all of this, our “no strings attached” model of cooperation is driven purely by the requirements and priorities of our partner countries.
The countries present here together represent almost half of the humanity.
Whatever we do, will impact the world substantially.
So, it is our solemn duty to make a better world – brick by brick, or, through BRICS.
Yesterday, I had spoken about the BRICS driving the global transformation in the next ten years for it to be a Golden Decade.
I suggest that this can be brought about with our proactive approach, policies, and action, on the following ten Noble Commitments:
1. Creating a Safer World: by organized and coordinated action on at least three issues: Counter Terrorism, Cyber Security and Disaster Management; 2.
Through these agenda points, and action on them, we will be contributing directly to the welfare of the Global Community in addition to welfare of our own people.
I commend President Xi for ably steering the BRICS Chairmanship for the year 2017, and for his warm welcome and hospitality in this beautiful city of Xiamen.
I also welcome President Zuma and commit India’s full support for Johannesburg Summit next year.
I am very fortunate that once again I have got the opportunity to meet you.
His highness crown prince of Abu Dhabhi visited India in 2016.
India takes pride in that more than 3 million Indians living in the gulf countries have become partners in the developmental journey of this region.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the gulf countries, I salute them.
They have provided this kind of good environment to more than 30 lakh Indians as if it is their second home outside India.
Indian community also sowed the seeds of their dreams along with the dreams of local people and also with the same commitment by considering this place as their own home.
And, in a way, we have been able to experience a very good partnership among the human groups in the gulf countries.
In UAE, people were surprised when his highness crown prince took the initiative of constructing a temple in Abu Dhabi when I came here last time.
I would like to express my gratitude to his highness crown prince on behalf of all the 1.25 billion Indians.
We have been raised in a tradition in which a temple is a medium for the humanity.
And where a holy place is a catholic agent of humanity, where a holy place is an agent of harmony.
And I believe that this temple will be unique in terms of architecture, in terms of technology, and in terms messaging in any case.
But an opportunity will also be there for making the world community feel the mantra which we have followed for living our lives that is: the whole world is one family.
And because of this thing it will also become a medium for acquiring an unique Indian identity.
I would like to tell all those who are related to the construction of the temple that the rulers of this place have shown so much respect for India, have given so much respect to India’s cultural traditions that now it is our responsibility not to leave any loose end, not to commit any mistake.
I have this expectation from all of you.
Today, the country is scaling new heights of development.
It’s a matter of pride for India that today the country has been given a place of particular respect in a global level summit.
I have been invited to address the summit.
Here, it’s not difficult for you to gather information about India.
You have such knowledge about India that if I talk about one thing then you will talk about ten things.
And in a way a mini India resides here.
There is not even a single corner in this country where India is not represented.
Friends, let’s pack your belongings and go somewhere else.
We have been through those periods of despair, apprehension and confusion.
There was a time when the common man of this country used to ask, if it was possible ?
Whether it will happen?
Whether it can be done in our country?
Friends, why should we tax our mind!
From that kind of feeling, the inner feeling today has reached this stage where people ask: Modi Ji please tell when this thing will happen.
There is no complaint rather there is confidence that if it is to happen it will happen now.
In 2014, we were at the 142nd position in the ease of doing business ranking at global level.
It means it was bit easier to count if you start counting from the last number.
But it would take a lot more time if you start counting from the beginning.
No other country in the world has jumped forty-two spots to reach at the hundredth spot in the World Bank’s ease of doing business ranking in such a short span of time.
The destiny has entrusted India with some responsibilities for the fulfillment of her global role.
Today, the world says that the 21st century belongs to Asia.
We will have to work hard keeping in view our long term interests.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about Shreya (what must be done) and Priya (what is liked by us).
If I replace currency then the poor section of the society immediately understands that it’s a solid step in the right direction.
However, the one who spent sleepless nights continues to weep even after two years.
For the last seven years it was being debated whether GST law should be implemented or not.
It’s been done now.
So it’s true that if we move to a new house after living in the earlier house for years we feel very happy during the night that we have constructed a good house, it’s a newly constructed house.
However, when we wake up the next morning we go the left side habitually believing that the bathroom was there and we hit the wall.
We later realise that it’s a new house and the bathroom is on the right side in this house.
Whether everybody has experienced this thing or not?
Then there will be difficulties when things have to be changed.
However, it’s worthwhile to do so.
This is the way which was shown by Mahatma Gandhi.
And today GST has been moving ahead by getting acceptance as a system by overcoming its shortcomings in such a short span of time.
The country is changing.
The brighter aspect of the partnership has begun.
I just wanted to say this.
You have turned up in such large numbers; you have showered so much love.
My eyes do not even reach the other side.
I’m extremely grateful to all of you.
I am finishing this visit in Jet speed.
I’m going to return after visiting five countries within 70-80 hours.
Today evening I am going to have the good luck of meeting the Indian community in very large numbers over there as well.
I need to share some of my thoughts with them as well.
Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
And I assure you that whatever dreams you have, whatever dreams your own people have in India, we are going to realise those dreams together and ahead of time.
I assure you of this thing.
Once again I thank you very much.

The Prime Minister appreciated this gesture of French President.
I am very happy to be talking to you in Jaffna today through Live Video Link.
I am all the more happy that this is the occasion when the National Emergency Ambulance service is being extended all over Sri Lanka.
This event marks another major achievement in the development partnership of India and Sri Lanka.
My Friend Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe had talked to me during my visit to Sri Lanka in 2015 about establishing such a system in Sri Lanka.
I am very happy that in July 2016, the first phase of this service began in the Western and Southern Provinces.
During my visit to Sri Lanka last year I had promised the friendly people of Sri Lanka that India will work for expanding the pre-hospital Emergency Ambulance Service all over Sri Lanka.
I am happy that India has completed its promise in a timely manner and we have marked today the beginning of the second phase of the Service.
I am also happy that this phase of expansion begins with the Northern Province.
India is happy to work together with you for wipingtears from the past and ushering in a bright future.
I understand that the people associated with this service have been trained in India.
The requiredskills and the local employment will also receive a boost.
It is not just a co-incidence that India has the privilegeto be Sri Lanka’s partner in establishing this first responder service and in its expansion.
I appreciate the efforts of President His Excellency Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe for meeting the aspirations of all the citizens of Sri Lanka.
I have very fond memories from my two visits to Sri Lanka as Prime Minister.
I have been overwhelmed by the love and affection, which were showered on me.
I also had the good fortune of being the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Jaffna.
All these are unforgettable experiences.
The existence of all nations is closely linked to their neighbours.
I believe that our development cooperation with Sri Lanka is an important means for translating our vision of shared progress into reality.
Three years ago, when I had the honour to address the Parliament in Sri Lanka, I had spoken about the need to take all possible steps for converting proximityinto close relations.
I am reminded of what Mahatma Gandhi had said in 1927, when he had visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of the student Congress of Jaffna.
He had then travelled from Matara in the South to Point Pedro in the North.
Just before returning through Talaimannar, his words to the Reception Committee in Jaffna were: “The message that I can leave for Jaffna as for the whole of Ceylonis: let it not be “out of sight, out of mind”.
I have the same message today.
Our people should be in constant touch with each other.
So that we know each other better and become even closer friends.
I would encourage you to come to India and experience the New India that is taking shape.
I am happy to learn that His Excellency Prime MinisterWickeremesinghewill be visiting India in early August.
I wish you a comfortable journey and enjoyable stay in India..
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the scheme of amalgamation for amalgamating Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank, with Bank of Baroda as the transferee bank and Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank as transferor banks.
The amalgamation will help create a strong globally competitive bank with economies of scale and enable realisation of wide-ranging synergies.
Leveraging of networks, low-cost deposits and subsidiaries of the three banks has the potential of yielding significant synergies for positioning the consolidated entity for substantial rise in customer base, market reach, operational efficiency, wider bouquet of products and services, and improved access for customers.

This event not only connects the Silicon Valley with Hyderabad but also show-cases the close ties between the United States of America and India.
It underlines our shared commitment towards encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation.
In Indian mythology, woman is an incarnation of Shakti – the Goddess of power.
We believe women empowerment is vital to our development.

The ancient Indian treatise, Charaka Samhita, introduced the world to Ayurveda.

The invention of zero, foundation of this binary system happened with Aryabhatta’s work in India.

Swami Vivekananda had said Each work has to pass through three stages – ridicule, opposition, and then acceptance.
Those who think ahead of their time are sure to be misunderstood.
Most entrepreneurs would be familiar with this.
The power to think differently and ahead of the times for the betterment of mankind is what sets entrepreneurs apart.
I see that power in India’s young generation today.
I see 800 million potential entrepreneurs who can work towards making the world a better place.

This offers immense potential for the growth of any venture, in terms of outreach and job creation.

It aims to minimize the regulatory burden and provide support to startups.
The jump in India’s ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report, from 142 to 100, in three years, is a result of this.
The process is not yet complete.
This is an area where we are not satisfied with 100th rank.
We would strive towards 50th rank.
We have launched the MUDRA scheme to provide easy finance of upto one million rupees to entrepreneurs.

A historic overhaul of the taxation system has been recently undertaken, bringing in the Goods and Services Tax across the country.

This upgrade comes after a gap of almost 14 years.
India has improved its rank from 54 in 2014 to 35 in 2016 on the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index.
This signifies the relative ease and efficiency with which products can be moved into and from a country.
An investment-friendly environment needs to be stable from the macro-economic perspective.
We have succeeded in containing the fiscal and current account deficits, and curbing inflation.
Our foreign exchange reserves have crossed 400 billion dollars, and we continue to attract large foreign capital flows.
To my young entrepreneur friends from India, I would like to say: each of you has something valuable to contribute towards creating a New India by 2022.
You are vehicles of change and instruments of India’s transformation.
To my entrepreneur friends from across the globe, I would like to say: Come, Make in India, Invest in India – for India, and for the world.

I am happy to be here today on the occasion of the golden jubilee week of Auroville.
Sri Aurobindo’s vision of India’s spiritual leadership continues to inspire us, even today.
It is important today to remember the vast extent of action and thought of Shri Aurobindo.
A man of action, a philosopher, a poet, there were so many facets to his character.
And each of them was dedicated to the good of the nation and humanity.
In the words of RabindraNath Tagore:
Rabindranath, O Aurobindo, bows to thee!
The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity.
The large gathering here today, is a reflection of that idea.
For ages, India has been a spiritual destination for the world.
The great universities of Nalanda and Taxila hosted students from all over the world.
Many of the world’s great religions were born here.
They motivate people from all walks of life,) to take to a spiritual path in their day to day dealings.
Recently, the United Nations has declared June 21 as International Day of Yoga, recognizing a great Indian tradition.
Auroville has brought together men and women, young and old, cutting across boundaries and identities.
I understand that Auroville’s Charter was hand-written in French by the Divine Mother herself.
According to the Charter, the Mother set five high principles for Auroville.
The first high principle of Auroville is that it belongs to all humanity.
This is a reflection of our ancient credo of VasudhaivaKutumbakam — the world is one family.
I am told, that the inauguration ceremony of Auroville in 1968 was attended by delegates of 124 nations.
I learn that today, it has over two thousand, four hundred residents from forty-nine countries.
This leads us to the second high principle of Auroville.
Anyone who is willingly in service of the Divine Consciousness is entitled to live in Auroville.
The third founding principle of Auroville is that it will emerge as the bridge between the past and the future.
If one looks at where the world and India were in 1968 when Auroville was founded, the world was living in compartments and in a state of cold war.
The idea of Auroville saw the world getting integrated by trade, travel and communication.
Auroville was conceived with the vision of enveloping the whole of humanity in one small area.
As the world progresses materially through science and technology, it will increasingly long for and need spiritual orientation for social order and stability.
At Auroville, the material and the spiritual, co-exist in harmony.
The fifth basic principle of Auroville is that it will be a place of un-ending learning and constant progress, so that it never stagnates.
The progress of humanity calls for continuous thinking and re-thinking, so that the human mind does not become frozen into one idea.
The very fact that Auroville has brought together such huge diversity of people and ideas makes dialogue and debate natural.
Indian society is fundamentally diverse.
It has fostered dialogue and a philosophic tradition.
Auroville show-cases this ancient Indian tradition to the world by bringing together global diversity.
India has always allowed mutual respect and co-existence of different religions and cultures.
India is home to the age old tradition of Gurukul, where learning is not confined to classrooms; where life is a living laboratory.
Auroville too has developed as a place of un-ending and life-long education.
In ancient times, our sages and ‘Rishis’ would perform ‘yagya’ to begin great endeavours.
Occasionally, those yagyas would shape the course of history.
One such ‘Yagna’ for unity was performed here exactly 50 years ago.
Men and Women brought soils from all parts of the world.
In the mixing of the soils, began the journey of one-ness.
The world has received positive vibrations from Auroville, in many forms, over the years.
On the occasion of 50 years of Auroville, I hope you can enhance your efforts in this direction.
Serving young minds through education will be a big tribute to Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.
Many of you may not be aware, but I too, have been a follower of your efforts on education.
Shri Kireet Bhai Joshi, an ardent disciple of Sri Aurobindo, and the Mother, was an eminent educationist.
But his contribution to the field of education in India, is worth remembering.
May Auroville continue to come up with ideas to empower the ordinary citizens of this country.
May people from far and wide bring with them new ideas.
May Auroville become the centre where these ideas are synthesized.
May Auroville serve as a beacon to the world.
May it be the guardian which calls for breaking down narrow walls of the mind.
May it continue to invite everyone to celebrate the possibilities of humanity’s one-ness.
May the spirit of Maharishi Aurobindo and the Divine Mother, continue to guide Auroville to the eventual fulfilment of its lofty founding vision.
“New Year greetings to all Gujaratis.
May the coming year lead to the fulfilment of all your aspirations.
May everyone be healthy and happy.
Saal Mubarak”, the Prime Minister said.
“India will never get bogged down by such cowardly attacks and the evil designs of hate.

Youth from Jammu and Kashmir call on PM

I will visit Japan on 10-12 November 2016 for the Annual Summit.

In Tokyo, I will have a detailed interaction with top business leaders from India and Japan, to look for ways to further strengthen our trade and investment ties.
On 12 November, Prime Minister Abe and I will travel to Kobe on the famed Shinkansen – the technology that will be deployed for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Railway.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved change in the basis of classifying Micro, Small and Medium enterprises from ‘investment in plant & machinery/equipment’ to ‘annual turnover’.
This will encourage ease of doing business, make the norms of classification growth oriented and align them to the new tax regime revolving around GST (Goods & Services Tax).
Section 7 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 will accordingly be amended to define units producing goods and rendering services in terms of annual turnover as follows:
• A micro enterprise will be defined as a unit where the annual turnover does not exceed five crore rupees;
• A small enterprise will be defined as a unit where the annual turnover is more than five crore rupees but does not exceed Rs 75 crore;
• A medium enterprise will be defined as a unit where the annual turnover is more than seventy five crore rupees but does not exceed Rs 250 crore.
At present the MSMED Act (Section 7) classifies the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) on the basis of investment in plant and machinery for manufacturing units, and investment in equipment for service enterprises.
The change in the norms of classification will enhance the ease of doing business.
Terming India-China relations as a factor of stability in the world, the Prime Minister said that maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas is indicative of the sensitivity and maturity with which India and China handle their differences, not allowing them to become disputes.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the renaming of Kandla Port as Deendayal Port.
Ports in India are generally named after the city or town in which these are situated.
However, the Government, in special cases, after due consideration, have renamed the Ports after great leaders in the past.
There have been public demands from various quarters in Gujarat, especially from Kachhh district, to rename ‘Kandla Port’ as ‘Deendayal Port, Kandla’.
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay (25.9.1916 – 1.2.1968) was a prominent leader, who pledged his life to the service of the nation.
He devoted his entire life serving the nation and worked among the masses and dedicated and sacrificed his life for the upliftment of the Poor & Working Class at the same time.
Throughout his life, he worked tirelessly for Indianisation of democracy, honouring the public opinion, selflessness and respect for law of the land.
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay dedicated his entire life for public service and was the epitome of simplicity, honesty and selfless service for the poor and down-trodden.
Since the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay was to be celebrated on 25th September, 2017, it was felt that it would be most appropriate if the decision to rename the Kandla Port as Deendayal Port was made as a part of the birth anniversary celebration of this great national leader.

I would like to add that GST will also be the best example of cooperative federalism.
Subjects such as good governance, discipline and conduct, women empowerment, and forensic science, also came up for discussion.

The people of India have seen the work a Government with a full majority can do.
They have seen the work of NDA.
But, for Congress, Commonwealth Games were an opportunity to boost personal wealth of a few in the Party.
I want to say it on the floor of the Parliament that the Indian National Congress does not want our armed forces to be strong.
They do not want our security apparatus to be strong.
Which companies are they bidding for that they are acting so shamefully?
Dr.BabasahebAmbedkar was always ahead of his time.

Among these, the most sacred is the site at Jinja, at the source of River Nile, where a portion of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed.
In his life and beyond, he is one with Africa and Africans.
And, at the sacred site in Jinja, where a statue of Gandhiji now stands, we will build a Gandhi Heritage Centre.
It is not just the 21 years that Gandhiji spent in Africa, or the First Non- Cooperation Movement he led.
For India, the moral principles of independence movement, or the peaceful means to pursue it, were not just confined to the boundaries of India or to the future of Indians.
Nowhere did it apply more than in Africa.
Twenty years before our independence, the leaders of our National Movement had linked India’s freedom struggle to the fight against colonial rule around the world, especially Africa.
Even as India stood on the threshold of independence, the fate of Africa was not far from our minds.
Free India did not forget his words.
India pursued Afro-Asian solidarity in Bandung.
India’s principled support to Africa’s liberation movements often came at a cost to our nation’s trade.
As President Museveni said at the 3rd India Africa Forum Summit in Delhi in 2015 and I quote – “We fought against colonial rule together.
Uganda is an example of Africa on the move.
It is witnessing increasing gender parity, rising educational and health standards, and expanding infrastructure and connectivity.
We in India rejoice in every African success, because of our deep bonds of friendships.
And, Uganda is central to our commitment to the continent.

India will work with you and for you.
Our partnership will build instruments of empowerment in Africa.
We will stand in solidarity with your endeavours, in transparency, with respect and on the principle of equality.

Your Excellency, Taoiseach Enda Kenny,
It is truly a pleasure to be here in Ireland.
Short this visit may be, it is historic.
It has taken 59 years for an Indian Prime Minister to visit Ireland.
The Directive Principles of State Policy in the Indian Constitution are inspired by the Irish Constitution.
Irish experts gave us institutions like the Geological Survey of India and the first Linguistic Survey of India.
Today, sports manufacturers in India keep Ireland’s passion for rugby going.
Today, 26,000 Indians constitute a vibrant part of the Irish community.
And, the victims of the bombing of the Air India Kanishka aircraft find a resting place here.
In the 30th anniversary year of that tragedy, we thank you once again for the memorial that honors them.
In the pain of their unfading memory, we are also reminded of all that binds us today – our values and our aspirations and the challenges that we all face today.
India and Ireland must seek closer partnership and cooperation.
India and Ireland are among the fastest growing economies of Asia and Europe.
We are pleased that our bilateral trade and investment ties are growing, despite global and regional uncertainties.
Greater sensitivity of the European Union to India’s commercial interests and challenges will help us resume discussions on India-EU Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement.
India and Ireland are ideally placed to form productive partnerships to take advantage of the opportunities in the digital age.
I hope that our Joint Working Group on Information Technology will meet soon to chart out the roadmap for collaboration.
I am glad that we will soon have direct air services by airlines of both countries.
This will not only promote our business links, but also give a strong boost to our tourism ties that are already growing at 14% per year.
Science and technology and education are two other areas, where we have a good history of cooperation, and where we can do much more.
Ireland’s Science Centre in Karnataka is one example of that cooperation.
I sought Ireland’s support for the reforms of the UN Security Council within a fixed time frame – in particular, for successful conclusion of inter-governmental negotiations in the 70th year of the United Nations.
I also sought his support for India’s permanent membership of the reformed Security Council.
India and Ireland are peace-loving countries.
We have both been at the forefront on non-proliferation.
We respect Ireland’s strong and principled position on this issue.
India was the first country with which you established diplomatic relations in Asia.
We can now be your anchor in Asia.
Similarly, for India, I see Ireland as a vital gateway to Europe and a bridge across the Atlantic.
Thank you once again for your hospitality.
It has been a couple of decades since you last visited India.
We recall the pious thoughts of Paighambar Mohammad Sahab, who highlighted the importance of harmony, kindness and charity.
These are also the virtues the Holy Month of Ramzan stands for”, the Prime Minister said.
8 selected presentations on various themes of governance were made by the officers, on themes such as DBT, Swachh Bharat, e-Courts, Tourism, Health and Satellite Applications in Governance.

The Prime Minister urged the officers to inculcate team spirit, and work towards breaking silos, in whatever capacity they serve.
Addressing the gathering in Pune, he said the government is placing great emphasis on connectivity infrastructure.
He said the focus is on providing next generation infrastructure, and integration of the transport sector.

“On World Water Day lets pledge to save every drop of water.
When Jan Shakti has made up their mind, we can successfully preserve Jal Shakti.
This year, UN has chosen a valid theme- wastewater.
It will help further awareness on water recycling and why it is essential for our planet”, the Prime Minister said.
Noting the progress made in bringing corrupt officials to book, the Prime Minister said that the various initiatives and measures taken by the Income Tax Department to facilitate the people, should be communicated to all taxpayers suitably.
The 27 PRAGATI meetings so far have seen a cumulative review of projects with a total investment of over Rs. 11.5 lakh crore.
Today, in the twenty-eighth meeting, the Prime Minister reviewed the progress of nine important infrastructure projects in the railway, road, and petroleum sectors.

“When I address the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August, I am merely the medium.
The voice is of 125 crore Indians.
Share your ideas for the speech on 15th August, on the specially created open forum on the NM App. http://nm4.in/dnldapp”, the Prime Minister said.
Government will provide necessary allocations for remaining period of scheme after assessment before March 2020.
All eligible industrial units, which are getting benefits of one or more components of other schemes of the Government of India, will also be considered for benefits of other components of this scheme.
I have great pleasure to be amidst all of you at Coimbatore, the textile capital of South India and the commercial hub of Tamil Nadu, to inaugurate the newly constructed building for the Medical College and the Hospital.
On this occasion, the Central Government has also handed over the existing hospital, the medical college, and related buildings to the Government of Tamil Nadu.
It reinforces my government’s commitment to co-operative federalism.
I hope that the Government of Tamil Nadu will act quickly to start the College.
We should strive to make this medical college and hospital a model for high quality medical education and treatment to workers of the State.
My government is committed to the development of a generous and comprehensive social safety net for all workers.
This commitment to the builders of modern India comes from the firm belief that a ‘Swasth and Samridh Shramik will make a Samridh Rashtra’.
The ESI Scheme is based on the Gandhian principle of “contributions as per the ability and benefits as per the requirement” .
It covers over 7 lakh factories and establishments across the country and benefits 2 crore workers and about 8 crore beneficiaries.
It is available in 31 districts of Tamil Nadu.
Coimbatore itself has 50 dispensaries.
My Government is dedicated to the welfare of our brothers and sisters who are our Rashtra Nirmatas.
It is proposed to expand the coverage from only the industrial and commercial clusters within a district to the entire district by 31st March this year.
Since 1st August last year, the scheme has been extended to construction workers.
I strongly believe in the improvement of public service delivery standards.
To improve cleanliness, the Abhiyan Indradhanush changes bedsheets according to the rainbow pattern each day of the week.
And cleanliness is an important aspect of preventive healthcare.
Studies show that it can lead to savings of almost 7000 rupees per year for a poor family.
Friends, my Government has taken a number of path-breaking steps for the welfare of workforce of our country.
Keeping in mind our commitment to “minimum government, maximum governance”, the Ministry is simplifying central labour laws by consolidating the existing 44 laws into four labour codes.
Namely, on wages, industrial relations, safety and security, and health.
This would considerably increase the ease of doing business and facilitate job creation, without compromising on the genuine protections and rights available for workers.
We are progressing on the reform path by building consensus on these reforms through extensive stakeholder consultations with employers, worker’s representatives, and state governments.
A Shram Suvidha Portal has been created for online services related to 16 labor laws, including administering a process of transparent and random inspections of businesses.
A LIN number has been issued to nearly one million employers, enabling them to process single online filings on eight labour laws.
The services offered by ESIC and EPFO have been integrated with the e-Biz portal of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion to promote ease of business and limit transaction costs.
One such institution has also been approved for Tamil Nadu and with the active support of the State Government I hope this institution will start admissions quickly.
Friends, we all know that the Father of the Constitution is Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
But not many of us are aware of the immense contribution made by Babasaheb to the formulation of our Labour Laws.
I am therefore happy to inform that Ministry of Labour & Employment organized a conference in Delhi last month to commemorate the 125th Birth Anniversary Year of Dr Ambedkar.
I urge each one of you to read the booklet “Dr B R Ambedkar – Labour Welfare & Empowerment: Initiatives to make his vision a reality” which was released on that occasion.
We are committed to resolve to work collectively and collaboratively to realize the vision of Dr. Ambedkar for labour welfare.
Friends, industrial peace and harmony can be achieved only when the goals of employment and employability are in tune with the goals of industrial development and growth.
It is our shared vision to have an environment which is conducive for inclusive growth and development of the country.
I assure the state government all the cooperation from the central government in all its efforts in this direction.
I am encouraged to work more for the welfare of the workforce of India and strive towards “Making India a Better Work Place for All”.
Let us all come together in making our country the best place to work and live in.

I have met Excellency Abe on many occasions in Japan, India and around the world.
I have also had the privilege of receiving several high level Japanese political and business leaders in India in the last couple of years.
The frequency of our interaction demonstrates the drive, dynamism and depth of our ties.
It also reflects our continuing commitment to realize the full potential of our Special Strategic and Global Partnership.
Friends, In our conversation today, Prime Minister Abe and I took stock of the progress in our ties since the last Summit.
It is clear to both of us that our cooperation has progressed on multiple fronts.
Deeper economic engagement, growth of trade, manufacturing and investment ties, focus on clean energy, partnership to secure our citizens, and cooperation on infrastructure and skill development are among our key priorities.
Today’s signing of the Agreement for Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy marks a historic step in our engagement to build a clean energy partnership.
Our cooperation in this field will help us combat the challenge of Climate Change.
I also acknowledge the special significance that such an agreement has for Japan.
India and its economy are pursuing many transformations.
Our aim is to become a major centre for manufacturing, investments and for the twenty first century knowledge industries.
And, in this journey, we see Japan as a natural partner.
We believe there is vast scope to combine our relative advantages, whether of capital, technology or human resources, to work for mutual benefit.
In terms of specific projects, we remain focused on making strong progress on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail project.
Our engagement and agreement on cooperation in the financial sector will help us in accessing greater resources for infrastructure development.
Our dialogue in regard to training and skills development has broken new ground, and is an important component of our economic partnership.
We are also shaping new partnerships in areas such as space science, marine and earth since, textiles, sports, agriculture and postal banking.

It also brings peace, stability and balance to the region.
It is alive and responsive to emerging opportunities and challenges in Asia-Pacific.
As countries with an inclusive outlook, we have agreed to cooperate closely to promote connectivity, infrastructure and capacity-building in the regions that occupy the inter-linked waters of the Indo-Pacific.
As democracies, we support openness, transparency and the rule of law.
We are also united in our resolve to combat the menace of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism.
The relations between our two countries are blessed by deep cultural and people to people ties.
During Prime Minister Abe’s visit to India in December last year, I had committed to take steps to create basis for their further expansion.
And, as a result, since March 2016 we extended ‘Visa-On Arrival’ facility to all Japanese nationals.
We have also gone a step further in extending a long-term 10-year visa facility to eligible Japanese business persons.
v India and Japan also consult and cooperate closely in regional and international fora.
We will continue to work together for reforms of the United Nations and strive together for our rightful place in the UN Security Council.
I wish to thank Prime Minister Abe for the support extended for India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
We both recognize that the future of our partnership is rich and robust.
There is no limit to the scope and scale of what we can do together, for ourselves and for the region.
And, a key reason for this is your strong and dynamic leadership.
It is indeed a privilege to be your partner and friend.
I wish to thank you for the most valuable outcomes of this Summit, and for your generous welcome and hospitality.
Thank you, Thank you very much.

Marshal of the IAF Arjan Singh’s determined focus on capacity building in the IAF added great strength to our defence capabilities.

The regulator will follow the best practices of regulatory processes, which will help ensure that it performs its functions professionally and as per the applicable laws.
This institutional reform will lead to improvement in quality and market relevance of skill development programs lending credibility to vocational education and training encouraging greater private investment and employer participation in the skills space.
This in turn will help achieve the twin objectives of enhancing aspirational value of vocational education and of increasing skilled manpower furthering the Prime Minister’s agenda of making India the skill capital of the world.
Being a regulator of India’s skill ecosystem, NCVET will have a positive impact on each individual who is a part of vocational education and training in the country.
The idea of skill-based education will be seen in a more inspirational manner which would further encourage students to apply for skill-based educational courses.
This is also expected to facilitate the ease of doing business by providing a steady supply of skilled workforce to the industry and services.
In an effort to realize India’s demographic dividend, its workforce needs to be equipped with employable skills and knowledge so that they can contribute to economic growth in a substantive manner.
These efforts resulted in a large expansion of training infrastructure much of which is in the private sector.
At present, there are 20 Ministries/ Departments implementing skill development programs mostly using private sector training providers.
However, a need was felt for an overarching regulatory authority which could tend to all aspects of short-term and long-term skill-based training.

At the Ufa Summit last year, conducted so ably by President Putin, the SCO leaders had accepted India as its full member.
It was a landmark in India’s engagement with SCO.
Later today, we will sign the Memorandum of Obligations.
We are indeed grateful to the SCO Member States and its leaders for their overwhelming support for India’s membership of the SCO.
India is not new to the region.
Our historic linkages with you are centuries old.
And, its just not geography that connects us.
Our societies have been enriched by links of culture, cusine and commerce.
They form the bed rock of our modern day relationships with Russia, China and the countries of Central Asia.
With India as its full member, SCO boundaries would stretch from the Pacific to Europe; and from the Arctic to the Indian Ocean.
We would represent forty percent of humanity and over a billion youth.
To this group, India brings principles that are in tune with the philosophies of the SCO.
India has always enjoyed good relations with the Eurasian land mass.
We also share global goals of stability, security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific.
India would no doubt benefit from SCO’s strengths in energy, natural resources and industry.
In turn, India’s strong economy and its vast market could drive economic growth in the SCO region.
India’s capacities in trade, investments, information and communication technology, Space, S&T, agriculture, health care, small and medium scale industry can bring wide spread economic benefit to the SCO countries.
We can partner to develop human resources and institutional capacities in the region.
Since our priorities match, our development experiences would be relevant to your national needs.
The interdependent world of twenty-first century is full of economic opportunities.
It also faces geo-political complexities and security challenges.
And, connectivity among the countries of the region is crucial to our economic prosperity.
But, that alone is not enough.
Our region also needs to nurture strong rail, road and air links with the rest of the world.
Within SCO, India will be a productive partner in building strong trade, transport, energy, digital and people to people links.
Our decision to join the international North South Transport Corridor, the Chabahar Agreement, and Ashgabat Agreement reflects this desire and intent.
India’s membership of SCO would contribute to region’s prosperity.
It would also strengthen its security.
Our partnership will protect our societies from the threats of radical ideologies of hate, violence and terror.
India will unite with SCO countries to work towards this goal.
In conclusion Mr. Chairman,
Next year, we look forward to attending SCO meeting in Astana, as equal partners.
I wish all success to Kazhakstan in their Chairmanship of SCO in 2017.
Parents in most parts of the country must be busy with their children’s examinations.
And I hope that Bangladesh marches ahead on the path of progress.
Gandhi’s style of working had an incredible balance.
What the word, ‘Satyagraha’ means, what disagreement can mean, what Non-Cooperation in the face of such a vast Empire could be –Gandhi Ji established a completely new vision of resistance, not through mere words, but through a successful experiment.
My dear countrymen, if we, for a moment, pause to look with empathy at the happenings in society around us, and if we try to understand these, we would be amazed to see that there are lakhs of people, who besides their own personal responsibilities are working selflessly, for society – the exploited, victimised, deprived; for the poor and the oppressed.
But it is true that if 125 crore countrymen resolve, and decide to walk step by step on a path to realise that resolve, the dream of ‘New India’ can be fulfilled in our lifetime.
Over the last few months the country has witnessed a certain atmosphere in which people in large numbers have participated in the digital payment, ‘Digidhan’ movement.
Can 125 crore countrymen resolve to undertake 2500 crores digital transactions during this year?
This is exactly what I want – – that 125 crore countrymen be angered by filth.
My dear Countrymen, right from the beginning since I have started the programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I have been receiving a lot of suggestions on one issue, and in most of those, people have expressed concern about food wastage.
We can’t even finish half of what is on our plates and then leave it uneaten.
Have you ever thought about how much food we waste?
Have you ever thought how many poor people can be fed if we don’t thus waste our food?
The person suffering from depression too doesn’t speak out himself as he feels a sense of shame about it.
Under this MoU, both countries will jointly organise various programmes such as forums, seminars, workshops, and training on matters related to innovation; share open source technologies with each other and jointly develop projects (and including partnering with relevant industries in the respective countries) to assist innovators in converting their ideas into commercially viable innovations leading to joint technology development and transfer of technology for Societal benefit.
The MoU will provide a mechanism and help in creating an ecosystem that will promote inclusive innovation and entrepreneurship at the grassroot level in both countries with particular focus on Indigenous knowledge systems and Agriculture Biotechnology.
On Thursday, I had the privilege to host the ASEAN leaders for the Commemorative Summit to mark 25 years of ASEAN-India Partnership.
Their presence with us is an unprecedented gesture of goodwill from ASEAN nations.
Responding to this, on a winter morning, India has come out to greet them in a warm embrace of friendship.
This is no ordinary event.
The India-ASEAN partnership may be just 25 years old.
But, India’s ties with Southeast Asia stretch back more than two millennia.
More than two decades ago, India opened itself to the world with tectonic changes.
And, with instincts honed over centuries, it turned naturally to the East.
Thus began a new journey of India’s reintegration with the East.
For India, most of our major partners and markets — from ASEAN and East Asia to North America — lie to the East.
And, Southeast Asia and ASEAN, our neighbours by land and sea, have been the springboard of our Look East and, for the last three years, the Act East Policy.
Along the way, from dialogue partners, ASEAN and India have become strategic partners.
We advance our broad-based partnership through 30 mechanisms.
With each Asean member, we have growing diplomatic, economic and security partnership.

The people of India also join the friendly people of Thailand in praying for the long, prosperous and peaceful reign of the new king, His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun.
The traditionally close and cordial relations have their historical roots in the common struggle for liberation from foreign rule and the national struggle for independence.
Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and President Hồ Chí Minh led our peoples in the heroic struggle against colonialism.
During the visit of Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng to India in 2007, we signed the Strategic Partnership agreement.

Singapore and India share a strategic partnership.
Our political relations are infused with goodwill, warmth and trust.
Our defence ties are among the strongest for both.
Our economic partnership covers every area of priority for our two nations.
Singapore is India’s leading destination and source of investments.
Thousands of Indian companies are registered in Singapore.
Sixteen Indian cities have over 240 direct flights every week to Singapore.

I had a very satisfying visit to the Philippines a little over two months ago.
We are both strong in services and our growth rates are amongst the highest among major countries.
Our business and trade potential holds great promise.

India continues this valuable association in the ongoing restoration of Ta-Prohm temple.
After the collapse of Khmer Rouge regime, India was the first country to recognize the new government in 1981.
India was also associated with the Paris Peace Accord and its finalization in 1991.
These traditional bonds of friendship have strengthened through regular exchange of high level visits.
We have expanded our cooperation in diverse fields such as institutional capacity building, human resource development, developmental and social projects, cultural exchanges, defence cooperation, tourism and people-to- people contact.
In the ASEAN context, and on various global platforms, Cambodia is an important interlocutor and a supportive partner for India.
India is committed to remain a partner in Cambodia’s economic development and looks forward to further deepen its traditional ties.
And, India and ASEAN are doing much more.
The strength and resilience of partnerships come not just from arithmetic of numbers, but also from the underpinnings of the relationship.
India and ASEAN nations have relations free from contests and claims.
We have a common vision for the future, built on commitment to inclusion and integration, belief in sovereign equality of all nations irrespective of size, and support for free and open pathways of commerce and engagement.
The ASEAN-India partnership will continue to grow.
With the gift of demography, dynamism and demand — and with rapidly maturing economies — India and ASEAN will build a strong economic partnership.
Connectivity will increase and trade will expand.
In an era of cooperative and competitive federalism in India, our states are also building productive cooperation with Southeast Asian nations.
India’s Northeast is on a resurgent path.
Links with Southeast Asia will accelerate its progress.
In turn, a connected Northeast will be a bridge to ASEAN-India ties of our dreams.
As Prime Minister, I have attended four annual ASEAN-India Summits and East Asia Summit.
These have reinforced my conviction in ASEAN unity, centrality and leadership in shaping the region in this vision.
This is a year of milestones.
India turned 70 last year.
ASEAN reached the golden milestone of 50 years.
We can each look to our future with optimism and to our partnership with confidence.
At 70, India exudes the spirit, enterprise and energy of its young population.
As the fastest growing major economy in the world, India has become the new frontier of global opportunities and an anchor of stability of the global economy.
With every passing day, it is easier and smoother to do business in India.
I hope that ASEAN nations, as our neighbours and friends, will be an integral part of New India’s transformation.
We admire ASEAN’s own progress.
Born when Southeast Asia was a theatre of a brutal war and a region of uncertain nations, ASEAN has united 10 countries behind a common purpose and a shared future.
A future of hope needs a solid bedrock of peace.
This is an age of change, disruptions and shifts that comes only rarely in history.
ASEAN and India have immense opportunities — indeed, enormous responsibility — to chart a steady course through the uncertainty and turbulence of our times to a stable and peaceful future for our region and the world.
Indians have always looked East to see the nurturing sunrise and the light of opportunities.
And, in Delhi, ASEAN and India renewed their pledge for the journey ahead.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Opening Ceremony of the International Vesak Day Celebrations at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo.
The Prime Minister was greeted on arrival at the venue by Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, and Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
Lord Buddha’s first sermon in Varanasi, which I have the honour to represent in the Parliament, set in motion the wheel of Dhamma.
The friendship between India and Sri Lanka was etched in time by the “Great Master”.
Buddhism imparts an ever present radiance to our relationship.
Ours is a friendship that lives in the hearts of our people and in the fabric of our societies.
To honour and deepen our links of Buddhist heritage, I have the great pleasure to announce that from August this year, Air India will operate direct flights between Colombo and Varanasi.
The Middle Path shown by Buddha, speaks to all of us.
Its universality and evergreen nature are striking.
The themes may appear independent.
But, they are both deeply interdependent and interconnected.
This arises principally because of Tanhaa, or Trishna in Sanskrit, the thirst, which in turn stems from greed.
Our desire to achieve all our wants has created income inequalities in communities and disturbed social harmony.
Similarly, the biggest challenge to Sustainable World Peace today is not necessarily from conflict between the nation states.
It is from the mindsets, thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence.
The menace of terrorism in our region is a concrete manifestation of this destructive emotion.
Sadly, these ideologies of hate and their proponents in our region are not open to dialogue and hence only open to causing death and destruction.
As Buddha said, “there is no higher bliss than peace”.
This is the true path to free individuals, families, societies, nations and the world at large from the three poisons of greed, hatred and ignorance.
On the blessed day of Vesak, let us light the lamps of knowledge to move out of darkness; let us look more within; and let us uphold nothing else but the truth.
And, dedicate our efforts to follow the path of Buddha whose light shines all over the world.
I look forward to paying homage at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, in Kandy today afternoon.
May the Triple Gem of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha bless us all.
The benefit of the proposed modifications will be available with effect from 1st January, 2016, i.e., the date of implementation of 7th CPC recommendations.
With the increase approved by the Cabinet, the annual pension bill alone of the Central Government is likely to be Rs.1,76,071 crore.
Some of the important decisions of the Cabinet are mentioned below:
1. Revision of pension of pre – 2016 pensioners and family pensioners
The Cabinet approved modifications in the recommendations of the 7th CPC relating to the method of revision of pension of pre-2016 pensioners and family pensioners based on suggestions made by the Committee chaired by Secretary (Pensions) constituted with the approval of the Cabinet.
The modified formulation of pension revision approved by the Cabinet will entail an additional benefit to the pensioners and an additional expenditure of approximately Rs.5031 crore for 2016-17 over and above the expenditure already incurred in revision of pension as per the second formulation based on fitment factor.
It will benefit over 55 lakh pre-2016 civil and defence pensioners and family pensioners.
In order to provide the more beneficial option to the pensioners, Cabinet has accepted the recommendations of the Committee, which has suggested revision of pension based on information contained in the Pension Payment Order (PPO) issued to every pensioner.
The revised procedure of fixation of notional pay is more scientific, rational and implementable in all the cases.
2. Disability Pension for Defence Pensioners
The Cabinet also approved the retention of percentage-based regime of disability pension implemented post 6th CPC, which the 7th CPC had recommended to be replaced by a slab-based system.
The issue of disability pension was referred to the National Anomaly Committee by the Ministry of Defence on account of the representation received from the Defence Forces to retain the slab-based system, as it would have resulted in reduction in the amount of disability pension for existing pensioners and a reduction in the amount of disability pension for future retirees when compared to percentage-based disability pension.
The decision which will benefit existing and future Defence pensioners would entail an additional expenditure of approximately Rs. 130 crore per annum.
During the interaction, the Prime Minister congratulated the award winners for their pioneering achievements, both in their individual capacities, and as torchbearers in their respective fields as well.

Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister extended Dussehra greetings to all Indians.
He said that being amongst people during the auspicious occasion of Dussehra gives him energy and renewed vigour to work for the betterment of the country.

He also commended the people’s participation in the de-siltation of irrigation canals undertaken by the Maharashtra Government.

In a lighter vein I am, of course, glad that our decisions are not subject to the D.R.S. review system.
Both India and Australia recognize the central value of education and innovation in the prosperity of our societies.
It is no surprise, therefore, that cooperation in the field of education and research is one of the most important aspects of our engagement.
The Australia-India Research Fund of nearly 100 million dollars has focused on collaborative research projects in the areas such as nano-technology, smart cities, infrastructure, agriculture and disease control.
Our joint development of bananas fortified with Vitamin A has entered the phase of field trials.
Our scientists are also collaborating on developing more nutritious and hardy varieties of pulses.

A number of institution-to-institution tie-ups have been concluded during this visit.
Student exchanges are an important element of bilateral education cooperation.
Australia is home to more than 60,000 Indian students.
Increasing number of Australian students are coming to study in India.
Responding to the aspirations of India’s youth, building world class institutions in India is one of the objectives of my government.
Prime Minister Turnbull and I discussed ways by which Australian Universities could connect and contribute to this goal.

And, With the passing of legislation in the Australian Parliament with bi-partisan support, Australia is now ready to export Uranium to India.
We are also aware that in this globalized world, challenges like terrorism and cyber security, extend beyond the boundaries of our region.
And, therefore, require global strategy and solutions.
Indeed, Prime Minister’s understanding and insight into regional and global issues brings a new dimension to our cooperation on matters that concern us both.
Our cooperation in the area of defence and security has reached new heights.
Our maritime exercises and exchanges have been productive.
Our bilateral mechanisms on counter-terrorism and trans-national crimes are functioning well.
I am particularly pleased that we have been able to conclude an MOU on Security Cooperation during this visit.

We would, therefore, actively work to cooperate more closely with members of the East Asia Summit and the Indian Ocean Rim countries to pursue our common interests.
A major pillar of strength in our partnership is the connect between our societies.
Australia is also home to nearly half-a-million people of Indian origin.
Their prosperity and vibrant culture enrich our partnership.
A very successful Festival of India called “Confluence” was held in many cities of Australia last year.
I thank Prime Minister for all the help and support accorded to the Festival by the Australian Government.
India and Australia have made major strides in our bilateral relations in recent years.
In months and years ahead, we only see promise and opportunities for our two nations.
Your curiosity is but natural; in this age when Radio was fading into oblivion, why did Modi opt for the airwaves?
He was not even adequately clad; it was a standalone kiosk on the edge of the road.
And in 2014, when I took charge as the Pradhan Sevak, Principal Servant, it was my wish to reach out to the masses with the glorious saga of our country’s unity, her grand history, her valour, India’s diversity, our cultural diversity, virtues embedded in our society such as Purusharth, Tapasya, Passion & sacrifice; in a nutshell, the great story of India.
From remote villages to Metro cities, from farmers to young professionals … the array just prompted me to embark upon this journey of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
Significantly, some young friends have attempted a study on the myriad subjects touched upon, over the many episodes of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
As a run up to each episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the expectations & aspirations of listeners through their letters, online comments & phone calls are crystal clear.
At times, when I look back, I am taken aback.
Sometimes people who write in from different corners of the country say, “We should not haggle beyond limits with marginal shopkeepers, auto drivers, vegetable sellers et al”.
The stories that you’ve sent across in the context of cleanliness, myriad examples of common folk… you never know where a tiny brand ambassador of cleanliness comes into being in various homes; someone who reprimands elders at home; or even admonishingly orders the Prime Minister through a phone call!
In a way your question were the a personal,amiable touch.
This great man was none other than our revered Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.

The person in the Railway Station was Narendra Modi.
The person in the Royal Palace in London is the Sevak of 125 crore Indians
My life at the Railway Station taught me so much.
It was about my personal struggles.
When you said Royal Palace, it is not about me but about the 125 crore people of India
‘Besabri’ is not a bad thing.
If a person has a cycle, a person aspires a scooter.
If a person has a scooter, a person aspires a car.
It is nature to aspire.
India is getting increasingly aspirational
I request you all- remember our country and not Modi.
He turned the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
He told every person that whatever you are doing will contribute to India’s freedom
Today the need of the hour is to make development a mass movement
Participative democracy makes good governance possible
Look back at India’s history.
India has never desired anyone else’s territory.
During World War 1 and 2 we had no stake but our soldiers took part in the Wars.
These were big sacrifices.
We will give back strong answers and in the language they understand.
Terrorism will never be accepted
Those who like exporting terror, I want to tell them that India has changed and their antics will not be tolerated
I want to work for the poor, the marginalised and the downtrodden.
18,000 villages did not have electricity.
So many women do not have access to toilets.
These realities of our nation did not let me sleep.
I was determined to bring about a positive change in the lives of India’s poor
I am like any common citizen.
And, I also have drawbacks like normal people do
Yes, I will go to Israel and I will even go to Palestine.
Criticism makes democracy strong.
My problem is not against criticism.
To criticise, one has to research and find proper facts.
Sadly, it does not happen now.
What happens instead is allegations

PM to young IAS Officers: Remain sensitive to circumstances and surroundings
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today advised young IAS officers to remain sensitive to their circumstances and surroundings, in order to be able to effectively connect with the people of India.
He urged them to use the next three months, to add value their own skill-sets, and also attempt to add value to the working of the Departments they had been attached with.
He particularly mentioned the use of technology in governance, and asked the young officers to work towards technology upgradation in the working of Government.
The Prime Minister urged the officers not to be overawed by hierarchy, and to be frank and fearless in their interaction with senior officers during the next three months of their attachment as Assistant Secretaries to the Union Government.
The Union Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Dr. Jitendra Singh and senior Government Officers were present on the occasion.
PM in Srinagar: dedicates Kishanganga Hydropower Station to the nation
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today dedicated the Kishanganga Hydropower Station to the nation at a function in Srinagar.
The Prime Minister said that the 330 MW Kishanganga Hydropower project would go a long way in fulfilling the electricity requirements of the State.
He emphasized the need for balanced development of all three regions of the State – Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh.
It has also approved acquisition of controlling stake by Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) as promoter in the bank through preferential allotment / open offer of equity, and relinquishment of management control by the Government in the bank.
The acquisition has wide-ranging synergy benefits for customers, LIC and the bank.
Benefits to the two entities emanate from economies of scale, reduction in the costs of distribution and customer acquisition, greater efficiency and flexibility in operations, and greater opportunity for cross-selling of products and services.
These would help financially strengthen both LIC and the bank, as well as their subsidiaries which offer financial products such as housing finance and mutual funds.
LIC would get bancassurance (i.e. selling of insurance products by bank) through the bank’s network of 1,916 branches, besides access to bank’s cash management services.
Further, LIC would gain in terms of furthering the realisation of its vision of becoming a financial conglomerate.
In 2016, the Finance Minister, in his Budget Speech announced that the process of transformation of IDBI Bank has started and that Government will take it forward and also consider the option of reducing its stake below 50%.
Financial implications:
The GSLV Continuation Programme – Phase 4 will meet the launch requirement of satellites for providing critical Satellite Navigation Services, Data Relay Communication for supporting the Indian Human spaceflight programme and the next interplanetary mission to Mars.
This will also ensure the continuity of production in Indian industry.
Implementation Strategy and targets:
The GSLV Continuation Programme – Phase 4 will meet the demand for the launch of satellites at a frequency up to two launches per year, with maximal participation by the Indian industry.
All the operational flights would be completed during the period 2021-24.
The operationalization of GSLV has made the country self-reliant in the launching capability of 2 tonne class of satellites for communication & meteorological satellites.
One of the very significant outcomes of the GSLV Continuation Programme is the mastering of the highly complex cryogenic propulsion technology, which is an essential technological capability to launch communication satellites to GTO.
This has also paved the way for the development of a high thrust Cryogenic engine & stage for the next generation launch vehicle i.e. GSLV Mk-lll.
With the recent successful launch of GSLV-F11 on 19th December 2018, GSLV has successfully orbited 10 national satellites.
GSLV with the indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage has established itself as a reliable launch vehicle for communication, navigation and meteorological satellites and also to undertake future interplanetary missions.
The extraordinary transformation in our relationship and achievements of our partnership are a clear recognition of your strong and decisive leadership.
Your decision to honour Indian soldiers who laid down their lives in the Liberation War of 1971 has deeply touched the people of India.
We agreed that the agenda of our cooperation has to remain focused on purposeful action.
We specifically looked at charting new avenues and tapping fresh opportunities in advancing our relationship.
We want to build cooperation in new areas, especially some high-technology areas, that have a deeper connect with the youth in both our societies.
We are a long-standing and trusted development partner of Bangladesh.
India and Bangladesh are also determined that the fruits of our cooperation must benefit our people.
In this context, I am happy to announce a new concessional Line of Credit of 4.5 billion dollars for the implemntation of projects in priority sectors for Bangladesh.
This brings our resource allocation for Bangladesh to more than 8 billion dollars over the past six years.
Energy Security is an important dimension of our development partnership.
And, our energy partnerhship continues to grow.
Today, we added an additional 60 Mega Watt of power to the 600 Mega Watt of power already flowing from India to Bangladesh.
The supply of another 500 Mega Watt has already been committed from the existing inter-connection.
We have also agreed to finance the diesel oil pipeline from Numaligarh to Parbatipur.
Our companies are entering into a long-term agreement for the supply of high speed diesel to Bangladesh.
We have also agreed on a time table for regular supply till the pipeline is constructed.
We are encouraging private sectors in both our countries to enter this space.
Several agreements for investments in the energy sector in Bangladesh are expected to be signed by the Indian companies in the coming days.
Today, together with the Honourable Chief Minister of West Bengal , we have added several new links to our growing connectivity.
Bus and train links between Kolkata and Khulna, and राधिकापुर-बीरोल have been restored today.
We are also happy to see the progress being made in two-way trans-shipment of goods.
We look forward to early implemntation of the B.B.I.N. Motor Vehicles Agreement.
This would usher in a new era of sub-regional integration.
Not just to forge wide-ranging business partnerships between our two economies.
But also for greater regional benefit.
In this, a major part of the effort has to be from the business and industry of the two countries.
We are happy to receive the high powered business delegation accompanying the Prime Minister.
Our agreement to open new Border Haats will empower border communities through trade and contribute to their livelihoods.
The training of 1500 Bangladesh civil servants in India has almost concluded.
Their spread poses a grave threat, not just to India and Bangladesh but to the entire region.
We have the greatest admiration for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s firm resolve in dealing with terrorism.
Her Government’s ‘zero-tolerance’ policy towards terrorism is an inspiration for all of us.
We agreed that peace, security and development for our people and for the region will remain central to our engagement.
Today, we have also taken a long overdue step by signing an agreement on close cooperation between our armed forces.
I am also happy to announce a Line of Credit of US dollars 500 million to support Bangladesh’s defence related procurement.
In implementing this line of credit, we will be guided by Bangladesh’s needs and priorities.
During my visit to Dhaka in June 2015, we had concluded the Land Boundary Agreement.
Its implemntation is now underway.
Along with our shared land boundaries are our shared rivers.
They sustain our peoples and their livelihoods.
And, the one that has attracted the greatest attention is the Teesta.
This is important for India, for Bangladesh and for India-Bangladesh relationship.
I am very happy that the Chief Minister of West Bengal is my honoured guest today .
I know that her feelings for Bangladesh are as warm as my own.
I assure you and the people of Bangladesh of our commitment and continuing efforts.
I firmly believe that it is only my government and Excellency Sheikh Hasina,your government, that can and will find an early solution to Teesta Water Sharing.
As a mark of our respect and deep admiration for the father of Bangladesh, a prominent road in our capital city has been named after him.
Along with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ji, I am also honoured to release the Hindi translation of Bangbandhu’s ‘Unfinished Memoirs’.
His life, struggle and contribution to the creation of Bangladesh will continue to inspire future generations.
We in India rejoice in our ties with Bangladesh.
Ties that have been forged in blood and generations of kin-ship.
Ties that seek a better and secure future for our people.
With these words, Excellency, I once again welcome you and your delegation to India.
Veer Surendra Sai is a well-known freedom fighter of Odisha.
Renaming of the Jharsuguda airport in his name will fulfill long-pending demand of the Odisha Government, which reflects the sentiments of the local public of the respective area.
It will also be a befitting tribute to the contribution of the revered personality associated with the State.

• Distributes, e-rickshaws, pedal rickshaws.
• Beneficiaries to get Jan Dhan Accounts and RuPay cards.
A total of 101 e-rickshaws, 501 pedal rickshaws, and push-carts are being given as part of this initiative.
The initiative has been synergized through various financial institutions including SIDBI, IDBI Bank, UCO Bank and the American India Foundation.
Senior officials of these organizations were present on the occasion.
The Prime Minister declared that this event marked the beginning of an initiative that would bring about a change in the fortunes of the people of Varanasi.
He said a lot has been said about removal of poverty, but those efforts have not brought adequate results for several decades.
He said that there is a need to increase the pace and the scale of the outcomes of the initiatives to remove poverty.
He said the poor are willing to work hard to improve the lives of the future generations.
In this connection, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government was putting emphasis on skill development, to help make the poor self-reliant.
The Prime Minister had earlier interacted with some of the beneficiaries who received rickshaws and push-carts.
He shared their dreams with the gathering, which ranged from a better education for their children, to a boost in income that would result from enhanced sales with the aid of a push-cart.
The Prime Minister referred to the large number of Rakhis from Varanasi that he had received during the recent festival of Raksha Bandhan, and thanked the mothers and sisters of Varanasi for their blessings and good wishes.
I join 1.25 billion Indians in once again extending a very warm welcome to all of you in Goa for the eighth (8th) BRICS Summit.
The footprint of intra-BRICS engagement has expanded over time to include large areas of economic activity.
The scope of our partnership today stretches from agriculture to industry and innovation; trade to tourism; environment to energy; films to football; skill development to smart cities; and from fighting corruption and money laundering to securing our societies.
This year, we have taken BRICS to our cities and provinces and linked it directly to our people from different walks of life.
A decade of collaboration has produced strong benefits of cooperation.
We are entitled to take pride in our initiatives and achievements.
The establishment of New Development Bank and the Contingency Reserve Arrangement are indeed signature achievements.
In a world of new security challenges and continuing economic uncertainties, BRICS stands as a beacon of peace potential and promise.
Our work holds much meaning for the developing world.
In the past year, BRICS have played an active role in shaping the global agenda for change and development.
Our association with Agenda 2030, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development has been purposeful and productive.
We also need to add more content to it.
Let me offer some thoughts for your consideration.
First, the process of institution building in BRICS must continue to remain a focus area.
The institutions that we build must support the development of our countries and regions.
They should enable greater flexibility and freedom, and offer wider choices in responding to our developmental priorities.
We look forward to translating into reality the idea of a BRICS Credit Rating Agency.
We must also speed up the work on setting up BRICS Agriculture Research Centre, BRICS Railway Research Network, and BRICS Sports Council.
There is also a clear need to build norms, create structures and pool our capacities to stop tax evasion, and fight against black money and corruption.
Our agencies must also build mechanisms of information sharing to bring to justice the tax offenders and money launderers.
BRICS should push for empowering the global governance institutions to reflect today’s reality.
Second, transform the quantum and quality of trade and investment linkages among BRICS.
In 2015, intra-BRICS trade stood at about 250 billion US Dollars.
We should set ourselves a target to double this number to US Dollars five hundred billion by 2020.
This requires businesses and industry in all five countries to scale up their engagement.
And, for governments to facilitate this process to the fullest.
Our agreement on a tax and custom cooperation framework is a good start.
The BRICS Trade Fair and Exhibition just concluded in New Delhi should become a regular platform for business exchanges.
And, the BRICS New Development Bank must play an active role to support this objective.
It can also help integrate our SMEs into global value chains.
We must also coordinate closely to preserve the central role of the Doha Development Round and the WTO.
India has tabled a draft of the Trade Facilitation Agreement for Services at the WTO.
It seeks to maximize the benefits of services liberalization and trade to the developing countries.
A strong BRICS support to this proposal will be in our collective economic interest.
Third, focus on key priorities of our economic transformations.
Urbanization, infrastructure and innovation represent the key focus areas for BRICS economies.
Under India’s Chairmanship, we have placed emphasis on digital- technology, smart-cities, urbanization, and cooperation between our cities.
The next billion internet users will come from emerging markets.
Our cooperation must grab this opportunity to transform the basic structure of our economies.
Fourth, secure our societies.
In the world we inhabit today, security and counter-terrorism cooperation is necessary if we are to secure the lives of our citizens.
Terrorism casts a long shadow on our development and economic prosperity.
Its reach is now global.
It has grown more lethal and adept at the use of technology.
Our response to terrorism must, therefore, be nothing less than comprehensive.
And, we need to act both individually and collectively.
Criminality should be the only basis for punitive action against the individuals and organizations responsible for carrying out terrorist acts.
Terrorist funding, their weapons supply, training and political support must be systematically cut off.
In this respect, we need to deepen the security cooperation between our National Security Advisors.
Early adoption of the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism will be an expression of our resolve to fight this menace.
Fifth, thriving people-to-people exchanges is the lifeblood of BRICS.
It brings vibrancy and richness to our partnership.
We have chosen to highlight this dimension this year.
I thank you for your attention.

He said that there is now an expectation among the people, that the Government will be able to resolve these grievances.
The Prime Minister specifically asked concerned officials to systematize the measures being taken by them to address grievances of students.

Among the projects reviewed was Nangal Dam – Talwara Railway line, which was first sanctioned in 1981-82, and has been pending since then.

Chennai airport will be modernized with provision of e gates, biometric based passenger screening systems, various other features and will decongest the existing international departure terminal.
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL’s) Ennore Coastal Terminal was dedicated to the nation on this occasion.
It will be a bigger and better alternative to its Tondiarpet facility.
With this terminal in place, products can be moved along the coast from Kochi, thereby also reducing the cost of movement by road.
Prime Minister Modi also inaugurated new Crude Oil Pipeline from Chennai Port to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (CPCL) Manali Refinery.
This 10 km section is a part of Phase-1 of Chennai Metro.
With this stretch all 45 km of the Phase I project becomes operational.
PM then proceeded to Hubli for the last leg of his journey today.
MHRD would assist the Ministry of Higher Education, Afghanistan in the areas of Curriculum Development and Capacity Development of Teaching Staff.
This is expected to promote student mobility under Study in India program, by attracting more foreign students to come and study in Afghan Institutions.
This MoU would be a significant mile-stone in the collaboration between two countries in education sector.
India and Afghanistan have strong diplomatic relations in various areas including education.
Till date, more than 35 Lakhs students have enrolled in about 2000 courses that have been offered through SWAYAM.
This includes courses from Class 9th to Post-Graduation and also for lifelong learning.
The students can avail credit transfer upto 20 % for the courses done through SWAYAM.
Also, this platform is being used to provide Annual Refresher courses for higher education faculty.
But, I rest assured, we all rest assured, that one of India’s strongest well-wishers Prime Minister Lee is in the driving seat for Singapore and for our bilateral relationship.
Excellency Lee, you are a friend of India.
We commend your commitment and contribution to strengthening our ties.
It is indeed a great honour for me to welcome you here today.
My first visit to Singapore as Prime Minister was on a solemn occasion, to pay our respects to Lee Kuan Yew, a guiding light not just for Singapore, but for the whole of Asia.
Whether it is manufacturing, environment, innovation, technology, or delivery of public services, Singapore does today what the rest of the world would do tomorrow.
Less than twelve months ago, during my visit to Singapore, we had upgraded our bilateral relationship to the level of a Strategic Partnership with “Renewed Spirit, New Energy”.
To deliver benefits to both our people, our partnership aims to combine the strengths of Singapore with the scale of India; and dynamism of Singapore with vibrancy of our States.
During my visit last year we had drawn up a road map to realize our ambitious cooperative agenda.
Expeditious implementation of agreed decisions has also been an important element of our engagement.
Today, Excellency Lee and I undertook a detailed review of the shape and substance of our strategic partnership.
During my visit to Singapore, Prime Minister Lee had taken me on a visit to the Institute for Technical Education.
Today, we have signed two MOUs focused on skill development: one, to set up a Skill Development Centre for our North Eastern States in Guwahati; and the other with the National Skill Development Council.
I also welcome the inauguration of the Centre of Excellence for Tourism Training in Udaipur, in cooperation with the State Government of Rajasthan.
Rajasthan is also partnering with Singapore in the fields of urban development and waste management.
Singapore is already our partner in developing Amaravati, the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh.
The trade and investment ties form the bedrock of our bilateral relationship.
We enjoy a strong network of business to business partnerships.
In this context, Prime Minister Lee and I have agreed to expedite the second review of our Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement.
The MOU on Intellectual Property, which has been signed today, will facilitate greater business to business exchanges and collaborations.
Prime Minister Lee and I also welcome the issuance of corporate Rupee bonds in Singapore.
It is a step forward in our efforts to mobilize capital for India’s large infrastructure development needs.
Our defence and security cooperation is a key pillar of our strategic partnership.
As two maritime nations, keeping the sea lanes of communication open, and respect for international legal order of seas and oceans is a shared priority.
Rising tide of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, and the rise of radicalization are grave challenges to our security.
They threaten the very fabric of our societies.
It is my firm belief that those who believe in peace and humanity need to stand and act together against this menace.
Today, we have agreed to enhance our cooperation to counter these threats, including in the domain of cyber security.
India has embarked on a path of strong economic growth and transformation.
In this journey, we regard Singapore as a key partner.
Recently, we benefitted from Deputy Prime Minister Shanmugaratnam’s ideas on transforming India.
I also deeply value your personal friendship, and your leadership in taking our bilateral relationship forward.
Once again, I extend to you and your delegation my warmest welcome.
I am confident that your visit to India will be productive and successful.
Mentioning the target of New India by 2022, the Prime Minister emphasized that this can be achieved only by making it a people’s movement.
Giving the example of the recent Hackathon conducted by the Union Government, where students had proposed technology solutions to several problems, he said Universities should be centres of innovation.
In the same vein, he said youth in every State must focus on one sport.
He encouraged Governors to lead by example on the cause of Swachhata, or cleanliness.
He said Mahatma Gandhi, whose 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2019, is a source of inspiration, as we work towards an Open Defecation Free India.
He said that Governors can also motivate banks to give loans under Mudra to tribals, Dalits and women, especially in the period between Constitution Day on November 26th, and Ambedkar Mahaparinirvana Diwas on December 6th.
He said these achievements must be extended across all Union Territories speedily.

I believe that Mahatma Gandhi is still as relevant in today’s world as he was in his lifetime: Shri Narendra Modi
Ever since he tookover as the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi ensured that Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals, principles and teachings are held aloft, both in India and abroad, through his speeches and actions.
The National Salt Satyagraha Memorial, dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister on January 30, 2019, recreates the spirit and the energy of one of the defining moments of India’s freedom struggle.
Shri Narendra Modi’s pet project, Swacchh Bharat Abhiyan, inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, was launched on Gandhi Jayanti, October 2, 2014 in New Delhi.
While launching this scheme, he had said “A clean India would be the best tribute India could pay to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary in 2019”.
For the past four and half years, the scheme has been transformingthe length and breadth of India.
It has resulted in heightened awareness among the general public.
Khadi was a subject that Mahatma Gandhi brought to the core of India’s consciousness during the freedom struggle.
The interest in Khadi had waned since those heady days.
But it has been revived by the Prime Minister, especially through his speeches.
Shri Narendra Modi used his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme, to encourage people to buy Khadi products and thereby emphasizing on the revival of Khadi and cottage industries.
Shri Narendra Modi’s call had such an impact that the sale of Khadi products showed a quantum jump.
Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th anniversaryis being celebrated as a two year event, with many programmes outlined to celebrate the occasion.
To commemorate Mahatma Gandhi’s vision, the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (MGISC) was held in New Delhi from 29 September to 2 October, 2018.
The 4-day event saw ministers and sanitation sector leaders from all around the world participating and share their experiments and experiences.

In his presence, key global leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Chinese President Mr. Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, have visited Sabarmati Ashram to pay homage to the Mahatma.
In fact, the Chinese President described his visit to Sabarmati Ashram as one of the most memorable and enlightening moments of his life.The pictures of the Prime Minister and various world leaders using the spinning wheel, brought back memories of Gandhi’s use of the spinning wheel as a symbol of self-reliance.
From Brisbane to Hannover to Ashgabat, the Prime Ministerhasunveiled busts or statues of Bapu, creating a lasting awareness about the Mahatma, overseas.
The Prime Minister has put into practice the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi and showcased how his ideas remain relevant even in 21st century.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has approved establishment of two new All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Madurai, Tamil Nadu at a cost of Rs 1,264 crore and Bibinagar, Telangana at a cost of Rs 1,028 crore.
The AIIMS will be set up under Pradhan MantriSwasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY).
The Union Cabinet has also given its approval for creation of one post of Director in the basic pay of Rs 2,25,000/- (fixed) plus NPA (however pay + NPA would not exceed Rs 2,37,500/-) for each of the above two AIIMS.
• Each new AIIMS will have 15-20 Super Specialty Departments.
• As per data of current functional AIIMS, it is expected that each new AIIMS would cater to around 1500 Outdoor patients per day and around 1000 Indoor patients per month.
The objective is to establish the new AIIMS as Institutions of National Importance for providing quality tertiary healthcare, medical education, nursing education and research in the Region.
In addition, there will be a Medical College, AYUSH Block, Auditorium, Night Shelter, Guest House, Hostels and residential facilities.
The establishment of the new AIIMS will create capital assets for which requisite specialized manpower will be created, based on the pattern of the six new AIIMS, for their maintenance and upkeep.
The recurring cost on these Institutions shall be met through Grant-in-Aid to them from Plan Budget Head of PMSSY of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
Further, indirect employment generation will take place due to facilities & services like shopping centre, canteens, etc. coming in the vicinity of new AIIMS.
The construction activity involved for creation of the physical infrastructure for the various new AIIMS is also expected to generate substantial employment in the construction phase as well.
The Pradhan MantriSwasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY), a Central Sector Scheme, aims at correcting the imbalances in the availability of affordable tertiary healthcare facilities in different parts of the country in general, and augmenting facilities for quality medical education in the under-served States in particular.

This is the third time I am attending these Summits.
ASEAN is a key partner for our Act East Policy, which is vital for the economic development of our Northeastern region.
Our strategic partnership with ASEAN is also important for safeguarding and promoting our security interests and countering traditional and non-traditional security challenges in the region.
East Asia Summit is the premier forum for discussions on the challenges and opportunities before the Asia Pacific region.
Our ties with the countries of South East Asia are truly historic.
Our engagement and approach can be best encapsulated in just one word – connectivity.
We wish to enhance our physical and digital connectivity; to see greater people to people links; to strengthen our institutional linkages; and, to leverage the modern interconnected world for the mutual benefit of all our people.
During the visit, I will also have the opportunity to interact with the leaders of participating countries to discuss bilateral issues of mutual concern.”
Our interaction during the restricted session was constructive.
The New Development Bank has started disbursing loans in pursuit of its mandate to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development in BRICS countries.
We are in mission-mode to eradicate poverty; to ensure health, sanitation, skills, food security, gender equality, energy, education and innovation.
National programmes of Clean Ganga, Renewable Energy, Digital India, Smart Cities, Housing for All and Skill India are laying the basis for clean, green and inclusive development.
They are also tapping the creative energy of our 800 million youth.
Our women’s empowerment programmes are productivity multipliers that mainstream women in nation building.
We have also stepped up the fight against black money and corruption.
First, last year we discussed pooling our efforts to create a BRICS rating agency.
An Expert Group has since been studying the viability of such an agency.
I would urge that the roadmap for its creation should be finalized at the earliest.
Second, our Central Banks must further strengthen their capabilities and promote co-operation between the Contingent Reserve Arrangement and the IMF.
Third, affordable, reliable, and sustainable access to energy is crucial for the development of our nations.
Renewable energy is particularly important on multiple counts.
Recognizing this, India, together with France, launched a major international initiative – the International Solar Alliance (ISA) – in November 2015.
It will bring together a coalition of 121 countries for mutual gains through enhanced solar energy utilisation.
BRICS countries can work closely with ISA to strengthen the solar energy agenda.
Our five countries have complementary skills and strengths to promote use of renewable and solar energy.
The NDB can also establish an effective link with ISA to support such cooperation.
We would wish to see more clean energy funding, particularly in solar energy, from the NDB.
Fourth, we are nations with large youth populations.
We need to mainstream our youth in our joint initiatives as far as possible.
Fifth, at the Goa Summit last year we had exchanged thoughts on smart-cities, urbanization, and disaster-management in the context of cooperation between our cities.

Your visit this time helps us to carry forward the momentum of our cooperation and high level contacts.
The relationship between India and the Kyrgyz Republic is filled with goodwill from centuries of shared historical links.
Our societies share a sense of warmth that permeates our contacts with Central Asia, including the Kyrgyz Republic.
We are also bound by a common belief in democratic values and traditions.
President Atambayev and I held extensive discussions on the full range of our bilateral engagement.
We focused on our common priority of diversifying and deepening bilateral engagement.
We also discussed how we could work together to secure our youth and society against the common challenges of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism.

The Kyrgyz-India Mountain Bio-Medical Research Center is an excellent example of successful collaboration.

People have been at the center of such initiatives.
We shall give special emphasis to youth exchanges in our technical and economic cooperation programme with Kyrgyz Republic.
The understandings concluded today will support our thrust in these directions.
We are taking steps to expand this project to other regions of the Kyrgyz Republic.
India and the Kyrgyz Republic will be marking the 25th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in March 2017.
As we approach this milestone, President Atambayev’s visit to India will drive the process and our efforts of deepening our partnership.
It will also help consolidate the recent gains in our engagement and reinforce our ties in the months and years ahead.
With this, all nine presentations on various governance related themes have now been made in the current series.
Speaking at the conclusion of the presentations, the Prime Minister emphasized that the Union Government is open to new ideas.
He urged all Secretaries to continue thinking holistically and give top priority to concrete outcomes.
The focus of the budget is on issues ranging from agriculture to Infrastructure.
On the one hand, the budget covers aspects such as health plans to address the concerns of the poor and middle class, while on the other hand it has plans to increase the wealth of small entrepreneurs in the country.
Other aspects range from food processing to fiber optics, from road to shipping, concerns of youth to those of senior citizens, rural India to Ayushman India and Digital India to Start up India.
The budget is expected to give a boost to the hopes and aspirations of 125 crore people of the country.
It is expected to accelerate the development process of the country.
It is farmer friendly, common man friendly, business environment friendly as well as development friendly.
More savings for the middle class, new generation infrastructure for 21st Century India and assurance of better health – all these are concrete steps towards Ease of Living.
‘Operation Greens’ will prove to be an effective instrument in this direction especially for the farmers engaged in producing vegetables and fruits.
We have seen how Amul was instrumental in ensuring fair price to the farmers engaged in the dairy sector.
We are also familiar with the cluster based approach for the development of the industry in our country.
Now, keeping in mind the agricultural produce in different districts, agricultural cluster approach will be adopted in different districts across the country.
I welcome the plan to develop storage, processing and marketing facilities for a particular agricultural produce after identifying the relevant districts.
In our country, the cooperative societies are exempted from paying income tax.
Therefore, income tax exemption for the ‘Farmer Producer Organization’ -FPO, which is meant for the welfare of the farmers, is a welcome step.
By providing the linkages between the Self Help Groups for women engaged in organic, aromatic and herbal cultivation and the ‘Farmer Producer Organizations’ the income of the farmers will be increased.
Under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojna, now the villages will be connected to rural haats (markets), higher education centers and hospitals.
The scheme will be available to nearly 10 crore poor and lower middle class families of the country.
It means it will provide coverage to 45-50 crore people.
Under the scheme these families will get free treatment up to Rs. 5 lakhs per annum in the identified hospitals.
This is by far, the world’s largest health insurance plan for which government will bear the cost.
The idea of setting up 1.5lakh Health Wellness Centers spread over all the major panchayats of the country is commendable.
No tax will be levied on interest up to Rs 50,000 on their Bank and Post Office deposits.
Health insurance premium worth Rs 50,000 will be exempt from the Income tax.
Besides, relief from Income Tax has been provided on expenditure up to Rs 1 lakh incurred on treatment of serious diseases.
For a long time, the small and medium enterprises or the MSME in our country had to pay higher taxes than the big industries.
A bold step has been taken in this budget wherein the government has reduced the tax rate for MSME by 5%.
They will now have to pay only 25% tax in place of 30% which was the practice earlier.
MSME sector has been experiencing stress due to NPA in big industries.
The small entrepreneurs must not suffer because of the fault of others.
Therefore, the government will soon announce corrective measures to resolve the problems related to NPA and Stressed Account in the MSME sector.
This will give a push to shift from informal to formal sector and will generate new job opportunities.
However, the employer contribution will be maintained at 12%.
This is a major step towards empowerment of working women.
Special emphasis has been given to development of infrastructure related to Digital India.
The budget has ensured the following – remunerative price of crop to the farmer, upliftment of the poor with welfare schemes, respecting honesty of tax paying citizen, support to the spirit of entrepreneurs with a right tax structure and hailing the contribution of senior citizens to the country.
The agreement aims to establish the basis for a cooperative institutional relationship to encourage and promote technical bilateral cooperation on new and renewable issues on the basis of mutual benefit equality and reciprocity.
The Agreement envisages establishing a Joint Committee to develop Work Plans in order to implement the Agreement.
The Agreement will help in strengthening bilateral cooperation between the two countries.
The Minamata Convention on Mercury will be implemented in the context of sustainable development with the objective to protect human health and environment from the anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds.
The Convention protects the most vulnerable from the harmful effects of mercury and also protects the developmental space of developing countries.
Therefore, the interest of the poor and vulnerable groups will be protected.
The Minamata Convention on Mercury will further urge enterprises to move to mercury-free alternatives in products and non-mercury technologies in manufacturing processes.
This will drive research & development, and promote innovation.

Today, every Indian has been working towards realising the dream of a New India.
We have been moving in the direction of an India where the poorest of the poor person gets the equal opportunity for progress, where the poorest of the poor person can see dreams and fulfill them.
Today, I see a Mini India before me.
I was going to Africa as then chief minister of Gujarat and during that journey I had passed through Salala.
I was longing to visit Oman to meet all of you, to be amongst you.
Today, that opportunity has come.
Relations between India and Oman are hundreds of, thousands of years old.
From the last three years, we have been giving a new shape to India’s ancient and friendly relations with the gulf countries as per the present requirement by formulating a policy.
You people would have also noticed as to what extent the interest of gulf countries in India has gone up along with India’s rising stature and progress.
Naturally, there is a new momentum in India’s historic relations with Oman.
His Majesty Sultan also has a distinguished relation with India.
Today, my presence in this stadium named after His Majesty Sultan to have an audience with you people in such a large numbers has a special importance.
This reflects that how much warmth His Majesty Sultan himself has shown for India and Indians.
We are extremely grateful to him for this special gesture.
We have been working to make the life of the common man of the country easier by following the formula of: Minimum Government – Maximum Governance.
In the changed India, now the poor people are not being insultingly turned back from the banks.
In the changed India, the government is coming home to provide the gas connection, to provide the electricity connection.
The poor people have been given life and safety insurance at a premium of 90 paise per day and one rupee per day.
An amount of Rs. 2,000 crore has been disbursed as the claim to poor people under these insurance schemes.
We have announced such a scheme in the budget that has grabbed the attention of the entire world.
We have given assurance for the free treatment of up to Rs. 5 lakh to a poor family.
At present, the next generation infrastructure is being developed in the country by taking into account the requirement of the 21st century.
Especially, we have been developing the transport sector in such a manner that different components complement each other.
Highways, airways, railways and waterways, all these have been integrated as per the requirement of each other.
The work to construct 53 thousand kilometer long national highways has been started under the Bharatmala project.
The work to develop railway corridors in different parts of the country has been going on.
Metro rail has been expanded to 11 large cities of the country.
Also, the government has been developing more than 110 waterways in the country.
Now, the decisions are not delayed in India; now the challenges are being confronted.
The projects are being completed on time by setting the target.
This is an example of changing work culture of India.
It’s an example of a New India.
The country’s funds are saved when the decisions are taken with a clear conscience and as per a well laid out policy.
When the work is being carried out in an efficient manner, when the present resources are being utilised in the best possible manner then the country’s funds are saved.
I consider you people an important partner in the development of the country and in the nation building.
The impact of the solemn pledges made by you people for making a New India will also be seen in India.
It is a scheme for the operational and financial turnaround of DISCOMs, which are the weakest link in the power value chain.
It provides DISCOMs with a clear roadmap and opportunity to become profitable in the next 3 years.
UDAY is an important component of the effort to realise the mission of 24×7 affordable and environment friendly ‘Power for All’.
Extension of the timeline will enable States to participate in this scheme by allowing adequate time to complete the multi-stakeholder process required for joining and/or issuing Bonds.
In addition, Jammu & Kashmir will be able to float further Bonds.
Further, DISCOM Bonds worth Rs. 11,524 crore were floated.
In the year 2016-17, Bonds worth Rs. 48,391 crore have been floated by Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
The turnaround of DISCOMs is made possible through (i) Improving operational efficiencies of DISCOMs, (ii) Reduction in the cost of power, (iii) Reduction in interest cost of DISCOMs through States taking over 75% of the DISCOM debt, as on 30th September, 2015 over two years, and the rest being re-priced through bonds and loans at lower interest rates, (iv) Enforcing financial discipline on DISCOMs through alignment with State finances.
With the Cabinet decision today, the States shall take over 75% of DISCOM debt as on 30th September, 2015 by 31st March, 2017 by issuing Bonds.
This intervention will lower the interest burden of debt and allow States, which could not avail of the opportunity to join UDAY earlier to put DISCOMs reforms on accelerated path.
It is a significant step in realising the vision of 24X7 Power for All.

Every time the inputs that come in response to every episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, are analyzed in detail by the government.
These are suggestions that have emerged out of a certain squeeze of life’s experiences.
And therefore it is their natural desire that it gets a mention in ‘Mann Ki Baat’
According to me all of these things are extremely positive steps.
There are many places where ‘Roti Banks’ are operating.
Friends have you ever thought of travelling in a Second Class railway Compartment without a reservation, and going for atleast a 24 hours ride?

How are the lives of your co- passengers, what do they do at the station when they alight from the train?
You see, all these new experiments, these skills are such that they will bring you joy and will remove you from the limitations of life to which you’re tied down!
And if you think that after appearing in all exams, at a new threshold of your career you will learn some new skill, then you won’t get a chance.
Do try to do it; of course do not travel too much in one go.
If the new member does three transactions, performs financial business thrice, you stand to earn ten rupees for that.
I don’t have to be caught in a traffic jam and I don’t have to stop for anyone as well.

Complimenting the members, PM said every member from the ruling party as well as the opposition has contributed significantly for the cause of people during this tenure of this Lok Sabha.
He added that India is now the 6th largest economy and close to becoming $5 trillion economy.

And the credit goes to the mandate given by the citizens in 2014.

After the Conference, the Prime Minister witnessed an operational demonstration of India’s naval and maritime air capabilities.
I am delighted that we are meeting at a base outside Delhi.
And, the passage to our future prosperity and security also lies on this ocean.
It also holds the key to the fortunes of the world.
This aircraft carrier is the instrument of our maritime power and a symbol of our maritime responsibility.
The Indian Armed Forces have always been known not just for the power they represent, but by the maturity and responsibility with which they wield it.
They defend our seas and protect our borders.
They keep our Nation secure and our citizens safe.
And, in calamity and conflicts, they do more than just bring relief and hope to our people.
They lift the spirit of the Nation and win the trust of the world.
In Chennai, you battled the fury of rain and the river to save lives.
In Nepal, you served with courage, humility and compassion.
And, as in Nepal, in Yemen’s conflict, you held out your hand to every human in distress, not just fellow citizens.
Our forces reflect our Nation’s diversity and its unity.
They embody the timeless culture of India and the finest tradition of our military.
And, their success comes from the leadership that you provide.
Today, I express our Nation’s gratitude to our military.
I pay homage to those who made the supreme sacrifice, in silence and service, so that India marches ahead.
Our thoughts are with the soldiers keeping vigil on the harshest frontiers of the world; with their families that say uncertain farewells when they leave home; and, their loved ones who must sometimes bear their coffins.
I know how an officer, in the prime of his youth, feels when he does not make the next grade, not because he was not outstanding or was less deserving, but because the room above was small.
So, to honour your service and uphold your welfare will always be our solemn duty.
For this reason, we have moved with speed to implement the One Rank One Pension promise that had remained unfulfilled for decades.
And, we will build the National War Memorial and Museum that you so richly deserve in the heart of our nation’s capital.
We will also improve skills and opportunities for our ex-servicemen, so that when they leave the Service, they can still serve the nation with pride and dignity.
I also pay tribute to our internal security forces.
Their valour and sacrifices defeat terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, reduce the violence of Left Wing Extremism and keep our Northeast more peaceful.
I complement our negotiators for bringing new hope in the long standing Naga problem.
India is at an exciting moment of change.
There is a high tide of hope and optimism in the country.
There is a new level of international confidence and interest in India.
We have become the fastest growing major economy in the world.
And, our economy is on a more stable path.
Our factories are humming with activity again.
We are building the next generation infrastructure at a higher pace and with an eye to the future.
Foreign Investments are rising sharply and so is India’s ranking as a place to do business in.
Every citizen can see a future of opportunities and fulfilled basic needs with confidence.
This is important for India’s prosperity, and also our security.
In an inter-dependent world, India’s transformation is closely linked with our international partnerships.
And, so is our security.
So, there is new intensity and purpose in our foreign policy.
In the East, we have strengthened our traditional partnerships with Japan, Korea and ASEAN.
We have made new openings in the region, including with Australia, Mongolia and Pacific Islands.
We have raised our engagement with Africa to a new level.
We have retraced our ancient links to Central Asia.
We have established closer relations and security cooperation in West Asia and Gulf, even as we have revived our close relations with Iran.
Russia has always been a source of strength for us.
It remains important for our future, too.
With the United States, we have advanced our partnership in a comprehensive manner, including in defence.
It is also seen as an anchor for regional and global peace, security and stability.
And, as the world seeks to deal with rising threat of terrorism and radicalism, countries across all regions, including in the Islamic world, have reached out to seek cooperation with India.
Above all, it is our neighbourhood that is most critical for our future and for our place in the world.
But, ours is a difficult neighbourhood with the full spectrum of security challenges.
We see terrorism and ceasefire violations; reckless nuclear build up and threats; border transgressions; and, continuing military modernization and expansion.
The shadow of West Asian instability is becoming longer.
Beyond that, our region is marked by uncertain political transitions, weak institutions and internal conflicts.
And, major powers have also increased their engagement in our land and maritime neighbourhood.
From Maldives and Sri Lanka in the seas to Nepal and Bhutan in the mountains, we are working to safeguard our interests and our relationships.
The Land Boundary Agreement has boosted our growing relationship and security cooperation with Bangladesh.
There are many challenges and barriers on the path.
So, we will test their intentions to define the path ahead.
We remain committed to help the great Afghan people build a united, peaceful, prosperous and democratic nation.
We are also pursuing closer relations with China to harness the full potential of our economic partnership.
We will aim to address outstanding issues, maintain stability on the border, and develop greater mutual understanding and trust in our overlapping neighbourhood.
I believe that India and China can engage constructively across the complexity of their relationship as two self-assured and confident nations, aware of their interests and responsibilities.
As our world gets transformed, the character of economies change and technology evolves, the nature of conflicts and the objectives of war will also change.
We know that old rivalries can play out in new theatres such as space and cyber.
And, new technologies offer us new ways to be more effective against both traditional and new challenges.
So, we in India must be ready for the present and prepare for the future.
We have speeded up the process of defence procurements.
We have approved many long pending acquisitions.
We are taking firm steps to address shortages and cater for replacements.
And, foreign defence companies are coming here with ambitious new proposals for Make in India, from fighter jets and helicopters to transport aircraft and UAVs; from avionics to advanced material.
We can never call ourselves a secure nation and a strong military power unless we develop domestic capabilities.
This will also reduce capital costs and inventories.
In addition, it will be a huge catalyst for industry, employment and economic growth in India.
We will soon reform our procurement policies and process.
And, our offsets policy will become a strategic tool for improving our capabilities in defence technologies.
Defence technology will now be a national endeavour that taps the potential of all institutions in our country.
Armed Forces will be crucial to the success of Make in India Mission.
I am encouraged by your localization plans, especially in the capital intensive Navy and Air Force.
We must define our aims and our instruments for the changing world.
At a time when major powers are reducing their forces and rely more on technology, we are still constantly seeking to expand the size of our forces.
Modernisation and expansion of forces at the same time is a difficult and unnecessary goal.
We need forces that are agile, mobile and driven by technology, not just human valour.
We need capabilities to win swift wars, for we will not have the luxury of long drawn battles.
We must re-examine our assumptions that keep massive funds locked up in inventories.
As our security horizons and responsibilities extend beyond our shores and borders, we must prepare our forces for range and mobility.
We must fully incorporate the power of digital networks and space assets into our capabilities.
And, Networks must be seamless and integrated across agencies and forces, and are precise, clear and quick in response.
We have been slow to reform the structures of our Armed Forces.
We should shorten the tooth-to-tail ratio.
And, we should promote jointness across every level of our Armed Forces.
We wear different colours, but we serve the same cause and bear the same flag.
This is an area of priority for me.
We must also have a comprehensive strategy for external defence engagement, to develop our capabilities and fulfill our responsibilities to advance peace and stability, including in our extended maritime region.
In conclusion, to transform our country, every institution must reform itself.
Our Nation will progress when we all move forward in step.
And, we expect you to lead from the front in expenditure reforms or in clean energy and energy efficiency.
As you reform, we will do our best to meet your needs and keep you prepared.
As our economy grows, we will be able to secure ourselves better.
In turn, India pursues its dreams in the comfort that it is secure in your hands.
Our military leaders,
This is a year of anniversaries of the end of two World Wars and our 1965 conflict.
This is also a year when humanity has come together in the United Nations to combat poverty and climate change.
In the memories of the great tragedies of the past and in our united efforts for a better world, we are reminded of the enduring human story of progress and peril.
And, of the responsibilities that men and women in uniform bear.
For our Nation, for our friends, and our world.
And, you will help India rise to its promise and its place in the world.

India and Afghanistan have already signed an “Agreement on strategic partnership” between the two countries in October, 2011.
In order to take this cooperation forward this MoU has been jointly agreed through diplomatic channels.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said India’s spiritual consciousness is the reason for its long-standing civilizational ethos.
He said this spiritual consciousness had remained intact through the ages.
He added the words “Vaishnav Jan” could easily be replaced with “Jan Pratinidhi” (Public Representatives) in the modern context.
The Prime Minister later offered prayers at the Gaudiya Math.
PM condemns terror attack in Pathankot, says evil designs of India’s enemies will never succeed.

He said he is proud of the jawans and the security forces.

In this context he appreciated the work of the Avadhoota Datta Peetham.
He unveiled a foundation stone for a Knowledge Research Centre to mark the occasion.
He recalled that he had the great fortune to unveil a statue of Shri Basaveshwara in London recently.
The Prime Minister said that Indian society was unique because social reformers arose from it time and again, to reform society, and fight social evils.
He said it was the social reform movements of the 18th and 19th century that laid the foundation for India’s successful freedom movement in the 20th century.
The Prime Minister said that the 21st century is the century of knowledge, and the country which focused on knowledge and innovation would lead the world in this century.
He appreciated Jagadguru Dr. Sri Shivarathri Rajendra Mahaswamiji, for his Initiative of the Knowledge Resource Centre.
From bigger budgets to better out-comes, and from mind-set change to monitoring, there is lots to be done.
Hope that behavioural change can be ensured.
Hope that rapid progress can be achieved.
I am pleased to note that Latin America and Caribbean region and India will be show-casing adaptations of the global strategy during the course of this Forum.
As a result of our interventions, 840 additional lives of children under five are being saved each day in India as compared to four years back.
Children’s nutrition is being addressed through the POSHAN Abhiyan.
This has provided 800 million health screening check-ups, and free referral treatment to 20 million children, in the last four years.
One thing that constantly worried us was the high out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by families to avail medical care.
We therefore launched the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.
Ayushman Bharat has a two-fold strategy.
We have already provided free treatment worth 700 Crore rupees to 5 lakh families under this scheme within 10 weeks of its launch.
Today, being Global Universal Health Coverage Day, I again state that we will continue to work towards providing universal health coverage to all.
Each such district has been entrusted to a team that works across sectors like education, water and sanitation, rural development with top-most priority to health and nutrition.
Till 2015, more than half of Indian women did not have access to clean fuel for cooking.
We changed this with UjjwalaYojana, which provided cleaner cooking options to 58 million women.
We all know the saying: If you educate a man, you educate an individual; but if you educate a woman you educate an entire family.
We have translated that into “BetiBachaoBetiPadhao”- a progamme that focuses on the girl child, and on giving her the best quality of life and education.
We have also introduced Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana, that is expected to benefit more than 50 million Pregnant Women and lactating mothers.
This scheme enables direct benefit transfer to their bank accounts to compensate for wage loss, enable better nutrition and adequate rest before and after delivery.
Let us join our hands together as an expression of our commitment towards this noble cause.

It is a great privilege to speak to you at the inauguration of the second edition of the Raisina Dialogue.
Excellency Karzai Prime Minister Harper, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, it is a pleasure to see you in Delhi.
Also, a warm welcome to all the guests.
Over the next couple of days, you would hold numerous conversations on the state of the world around us.
You would debate its certainty and prevailing flux; its conflicts and risks; its successes and opportunities; its past behaviours and likely prognosis; and its potential black swans and the New Normals.
In May 2014, the people of India also ushered in a New Normal.
My fellow Indians spoke in one voice to entrust my government with a mandate for change.
Change not just of attitudes but of mindsets.
Change from a state of drift to one of purposeful actions.
Change to take bold decisions.
A mandate in which reform would not be enough unless it transforms our economy and society.
A transformation that is embedded in the aspiration and optimism of India’s youth, and in the boundless energy of its millions.
Every day at work, I draw on this sacred energy.
Every day at work, my ‘to do list’ is guided by the constant drive to reform and transform India, for prosperity and security of all Indians.
I am aware that India’s transformation is not separated from its external context.
Our economic growth; the welfare of our farmers; the employment opportunities for our youth; our access to capital, technology, markets and resources; And, security of our nation all of them are deeply impacted by developments in the world.
But, the reverse is also true.
The world needs India’s sustained rise, as much as India needs the world.
Our desire to change our country has an indivisible link with the external world.
It is, therefore, only natural that India’s choices at home and our international priorities form part of a seamless continuum.
Firmly anchored in India’s transformational goals.
India is pursuing its transformation in unsettled times, which is equally the result of human progress and violent turmoil.
For multiple reasons and at multiple levels, the world is going through profound changes.
Globally connected societies, digital opportunities, technology shifts, knowledge boom and innovation are leading the march of humanity.
The result, Globalization gains are at risk and economic gains are no longer easy to come by.
Instability, violence, extremism, exclusion and transnational threats continue to proliferate in dangerous directions.
And, non-state actors are significant contributors to the spread of such challenges.
Institutions and architectures built for a different world, by a different world, are outdated.
Posing a barrier to effective multilateralism.
As the world begins to re-order itself a quarter century after the strategic clarity of the Cold War, the dust has not yet settled on what has replaced it.
But, a couple of things are clear.
And, we welcome it.
Because, it captures the reality of the rise of many nations.
It accepts that voices of many, not views of a few should shape the global agenda.
Therefore, we need to guard against any instinct or inclination that promotes exclusion, especially in Asia.
The focus of this conference on Multilaterism with Multipolarity is thus timely.
We inhabit a strategically complex environment.
In the broad sweep of history, the changing world is not necessarily a new situation.
These IIMs were established in the year 2015-16/2016-17.
These institutes are presently functioning from transit campuses.
With this, all the 20 IIMs will have their own permanent campuses.
The IIMs will provide education to students to enable them to become professional managers.
The approval will promote economic and industrial development of the country.
I am delighted to be here at Gift City to inaugurate India’s first international stock exchange, that is, the India International Exchange.
Indeed, it is a momentous occasion for India’s financial sector.
As you are aware, this project took shape in the year 2007.
The vision was to create a world class Finance and IT zone for India, to provide services not only to India but the entire world.
In those days, as now, wherever I went, I would meet some of the top financial brains of those countries.
Whether in New York, London, Singapore, Hong Kong or Abu Dhabi, I would find many of them to be of Indian origin.
I was impressed by their understanding of the financial world, and also their contributions to their adopted countries.
I used to think, “How can we bring this talent back and at the same time, provide leadership to the entire financial world?”
Indians have a long tradition in mathematics.
India invented the concept of ‘zero’ and the ‘decimal system’ more than two thousand years ago.
It is no accident that Indians are now at the forefront of Information Technology and Finance, both areas of knowledge where zero plays a crucial role!
When the Gift city was conceptualised, I was Chief Minister of Gujarat.
Technological progress had accelerated manifold.
We had world class talent of Indian origin working in India and abroad.
India had a leadership position in Information Technology.
Finance was being increasingly married to technology.
It was becoming very clear to us that finance combined with technology, or “fintech” as it is sometimes called, would be an important part of India’s future development.
I deliberated a lot with experts about how to make India, a thought leader, in the field of Finance.
Gift city was born out of this vision.
Our aim was to provide world class facilities to India’s world class talent in finance and technology.
Today, with the inauguration of this Exchange, we have reached an important landmark in achieving that vision.
At that time, I had invited BSE to set up a world beating International Stock Exchange.
In the year 2015, during the Vibrant Gujarat event, they signed an MoU with Government of Gujarat.
Today, I am delighted to be here to inaugurate the new India International Exchange.
It is an important milestone not just for Gift city but for India, in creating 21st century infrastructure.
I am told this exchange will trade in equity, commodities, currencies and interest rate derivatives in the first phase.
Later, it will trade equity instruments of Indian and foreign companies.
I am told Masala bonds will also be available for trading here.
Many more companies from Asia, Africa and Europe should be able to raise funds from this important International Finance Centre.
This exchange is set to be among the fastest exchanges in the world with most modern trading, clearing and settlement systems.
India is in an excellent time-zone between West and East.
It can provide financial services through the day and night to the entire world.
The exchange, I am told, will work twenty two hours a day, starting when the Japanese markets start, and closing when US markets close.
I am sure, this exchange will set new standards for quality of service and speed of transactions across time zones.
This exchange is part of the International Financial Services Centre, – IFSC – at Gift city.
The concept of an International Financial Services Centre is simple but powerful.
It aims to provide onshore talent with an offshore technological and regulatory framework.
This is to enable Indian firms to compete on an equal footing with offshore financial centres.
Gift City IFSC will be able to provide facilities and regulations comparable to any other leading international finance centres in the world.
It is not easy to create an offshore-like environment in a large country like India with a huge domestic market.
India cannot be compared to small city states.
Such countries have very small local markets and hence can afford to have specially favourable tax and regulatory regimes.
Large countries cannot do the same.
Creating an offshore-like centre within a large country like India, therefore did pose regulatory challenges.
I am glad that the Ministry of Finance, the Reserve Bank and SEBI have found solutions to the regulatory issues.
Gift city will be able to mitigate many of these criticisms.
But my vision for Gift City is larger.
India needs to create thirty crore new jobs over the next twenty years.
It is a huge endeavour.
Skilled and well-paying jobs in the service sector will have to be part of this job revolution.
Indian youth can do it.
The international exposure which our youth will be able to get from Gift city will ensure that more and more of them will be able to join this important field.
I urge Indian companies, exchanges and regulators, to help create a pool of experienced and world beating finance professionals.
They can work out of this great new city and provide services to the entire world.
Over next ten years, I expect this city to generate several lakh jobs.
You are aware of the importance I attach to the development of smart cities.
Gift city is the first ground up truly smart city in the country.
All the 100 smart cities will do well to understand how Gift city has been able to create its underground infrastructure which can compete with the best in the world.
I have said before that India can become a developed country in one generation.
New cities will be important in creating the new India of our dreams:
I hereby declare the India International Exchange open.
I wish Gift city and the India International Exchange the very best.
In line with the Special Strategic and Global Partnership with Japan, discussions were held in a very cordial atmosphere.
PM Abe thanked PM Modi for the excellent hospitality during his bilateral visit to India in December 2015.
PM Abe conveyed that a survey Mission will be coming from Japan in May to take forward the Convention Centre project in Varanasi.
They also discussed measures to promote further trade and investment.
PM thanked PM Abe for Japan’s strong participation in the International Fleet Review.

This is the strength of India.
The country is progressing with new zeal, enthusiasm and courage.
When our goals are not clear, progress is not possible.
However, today the issue of ‘Red Carpet’ is being discussed.
We have reached 100th position in the ‘ease of doing business’ ranking.
India has become a hope for all the other countries as far as global warming is concerned.
Our youth has brought a paradigm shift in the nature of job.
Whether it is startup, BPO or e-commerce or the field of mobility, our youth has entered into new fields.
One international organisation has reported that during the last two years, 5 crore poor people have crossed the poverty line.
There are several schemes for empowerment of poor.
We are on the path of removal of corruption and black-money.
Transparency will be maintained in this process.
This should be realized by the people of this country.
Law is doing it’s own business.
We have to make efforts to attack this attitude.
We have to attack this type of thinking.
Those who did not get Talak (divorce) are also sailing in the same boat.
We made an effort to alleviate the grief of Muslim women by bringing an act in the Monsoon Session of Parliament.
We would like to go in the same path.
We do not want the path of bullets and abuses.
They will be able to take care of themselves.
Government of India gives enough money to Gram Panchayaths which will be useful for development.
We have to arrange for the elections to panchayats and local institutions.
We are progressing in this direction.
Every Indian dreams to have his own house, therefore we bring in “Housing for All.”.
He wants to get his house electrified, therefore there is Electrification for all Villages.

Therefore our aim is to get water for all.
Every Indian requires a toilet, hence our objective is to ensure sanitation for all.
Every Indian requires skill development.
Hence we have brought in skill development for all.
Every Indian needs quality health service.
So, our endeavour is health for all.
Every Indian requires security for which he needs a health insurance coverage.
To meet this need, we bring insurance for all.
Every Indian requires internet facility.
Therefore we are making efforts to get connectivity for all.
We want to lead our country towards the path of development by following the mantra of connectivity.
We don’t want the path of confrontation.
We do not want roadblocks.
We don’t want to bow our head before anybody.
The nation will never stop, never bow before anything,never get tired.
We have to scale new heights.
It is our aim to achieve enormous progress in the years to come.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Hon’ble Prime Minister has today given its approval to Recommendations on Fiscal Deficit Targets and Additional Fiscal Deficit to States during Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) award period 2015-20 under the two flexibility options recommended in para 14.64 to 14.67 of its Report (volume – I).
FFC has adopted the fiscal deficit threshold limit of 3 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the States.
Further, FFC has provided a year-to-year flexibility for additional fiscal deficit to States.
b) The IP/TRR ratio and Debt/GSDP ratio based on the data as contained in Finance Account for t-2.
To illustrate, for determining States’ eligibility for 2016-17, the IP/TRR ratio and Debt/GSDP ratio as disclosed in Finance Account of States for 2014-15 would be relevant.
However, the State will get additional space to raise borrowings which may result in much needed Government Expenditure for Capital projects/ infrastructure.
Under the agreement, both the countries intend to share their experiences on various regulatory functions and to provide mutual assistance including training activities.
Similarly, in USA, Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is vested with the authority to monitor all aspects of the insurance sector and to represent the USA on prudential aspects of international insurance.

Ladies & Gentlemen,
1. I am delighted to be here again amidst such a large and distinguished gathering of political and business leaders.
2. I am speaking to you at a time when the global economy continues to be weak.
Several parts of the world are still facing very difficult conditions.
This is a time when the world needs new engines of growth.
From the point of view of the world’s oldest democracy, obviously it would be nice if the new engines are democratic engines.
I am happy to tell you that today India is poised to contribute as a new engine of global growth.
3. A larger Indian economy has multiple benefits for the world.
Obviously, India presents a large and growing market.
But India is much more than a market.
4. As India embarks on a new era of development, it needs to learn much from America’s tradition of entrepreneurship and innovation.
America remains at the forefront of scientific and technological innovation from Ø air traffic control to air quality improvement, Ø from drugs to drones, from hybrid cars to hydro fracking.
I am therefore sure, that ours will be a partnership which sees both nations benefit.
It is rare that emigrants from one nation, who become immigrants in another, enjoy such high respect and repute in both countries.
Indian-Americans are a powerful cementing force in our growing economic and cultural ties.
6. I have just completed two years in office.
When I addressed you in 2014, I had just taken over the reins of government.
We faced a particularly challenging domestic and external environment.
Confidence of investors was at a low.
Doubts were being expressed about the future of the Indian economy.
The business community was unhappy with the inertia and stagnation that had set in.
There was frustration with archaic policies and red tape.
In 2 years, we have managed to overcome the odds and register an impressive economic performance.
7. I want to take this opportunity to describe to you the key elements of our policies.
I have said several times that my aim is to reform to transform.
For me, reforms are those policies that transform the lives of ordinary citizens.
In the last two years, we have taken a comprehensive package of reforms which go beyond more economic reforms.
I can classify them into four types.
8. Let me start with the macro-economy.
9. Since we took office, inflation, the fiscal deficit and the balance of payments current account deficit have all fallen.
GDP growth, Foreign exchange reserves, stock market valuations, and investor confidence have all increased.
This success is the result of a series of well thought out policies.
We have legislated a monetary framework with inflation targeting and an independent monetary policy committee to curb inflation.
We embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation and our fiscal deficit has been reduced substantially in each of three budgets so far.
Even while cutting the fiscal deficit, we have greatly increased productive public investment.
10. This has been made possible in two ways.
Firstly, we imposed carbon taxes on fossil fuels.
We took the bold step of de-controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies.
We then replaced them with taxes.
A Clean Environment cess has been increased by eight times from Rs.50 per ton to Rs.400 per ton.
Globally, there is much talk of carbon taxes but much of it is just that – TALK.
We have actually acted.
Secondly we have reduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods and use of technology.
Subsidies are increasingly credited directly to bank accounts of the deserving with fool proof biometric identification.
11. Let me now turn to our policies to stimulate growth and employment.
This audience is probably aware of the sweeping liberalization that we have undertaken in foreign direct investment.
We have put most sectors on automatic approval and opened up sectors like defence and railways to foreign investment.
The long pending insurance law reform was successfully passed.
Several insurance companies, including American companies, have already enhanced their investment in the insurance sector.
We are encouraging foreign and domestic investors to set up high quality and efficient manufacturing facilities.
We have greatly enhanced investment in roads, railways, ports and waterways to improve logistics.
We have made major process improvements in our ports to reduce the time taken for cargo to enter and exit.
We admire the start up eco-system in your country.
We are making a beginning in replicating it.
Our Start-Up India programme has stimulated a new breed of innovators.
In 2016, Bengaluru has become the fifth most preferred location for innovation centres.
It was not even in the top 10 in 2015.
12. For our economy to succeed, we need a strong banking system.
We inherited a system where cronyism and corruption were believed to be rampant in banking decisions and in appointments to public sector banks.
We are committed to ensuring adequate capital.
Interference in banking decisions has ended.
A new process for appointments has been put in place under a Bank Boards Bureau.
Credible and capable bankers have been appointed to head banks.
For the first time since banks were nationalized 47 years ago private sector professionals have been appointed in key positions.
13. I now turn to our policies to ensure that growth is inclusive.
We have brought two hundred million people into the banking system through the Jan Dhan Yojana.
This is more than the population of most countries in the world.
Now, these millions are part of our banking system, and words like ‘interest rate’ have a meaning for them.
These people have shown that there is great strength at the bottom of the pyramid.
Believe it or not, accounts opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana today have a total balance of almost six billion dollars.
14. The Jan Dhan Yojana has also transformed the ability of the poor to make and to receive electronic payments.
Every Jan Dhan account holder is eligible for a debit card.
India’s banks and post offices are also being encouraged to operate ‘mobile ATMs’.
A mobile ATM is one where cash can be drawn and simple banking tasks done through a hand held device.
15. We have provided a safety net through new social security schemes.
We have introduced three non-subsidised but low cost schemes covering accident insurance, life insurance and pensions.
Because of their massive coverage the premia are low.
There are now over 120 million subscribers.
16. We have paid special attention to gender justice and to empowering women.
We have a new savings programme to help pay for girls’ education with a special high rate of interest.
To relieve rural women from the health hazards of cooking with firewood, we are giving 50 million new gas connections in poor rural areas.
Under our new self-employment financing programme (Mudra), over 70% of the beneficiaries are women.
More than 27 million new women-headed businesses have been assisted.
We have changed our policies to allow women in combat roles in the armed forces.
New rules are increasing the representation of women on corporate Boards of Directors.
17. Agriculture remains India’s mainstay in terms of providing livelihood.
We have moved towards universal neem-coating of urea.
It has already saved crores of rupees of diverted farm subsidies and improved fertilizer availability to farmers.
It is an example of how simple reforms can be very effective.
18. We have introduced a Soil Health Card nationally, which tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil.
It enables the farmer to choose the best crop and right quantity and mix of inputs.
This greatly reduces wastage of inputs and increases crop yield besides protecting the soil.
By reducing unnecessary chemical inputs, it is also good for health of consumers.
It reduces costs, increases yields, improves the environment and protects the health of consumers.
19. This brings me to an achievement that I think even our worst critics do not dispute.
This is the change in levels of corruption.
For many years, economists and other experts have held corruption to be one of the main constraints on the growth of any developing economy.
We have taken decisive steps to curb corruption.
I have already referred to what has been done in public sector banks.
We have revamped our personnel management to ensure that senior positions are held by persons of integrity.
We have launched an on-going campaign against tax evasion and black money.
The poor are the greatest beneficiaries of the reduction in corruption.
20. Looking to the future let me outline what I see as the path we will follow in the coming years.
21. Firstly, we will continue to have disciplined and prudent macro-economic policies.
I firmly believe that sound macro-economic fundamentals are a necessary foundation for long term sustainable growth.
22. Secondly, we will combine this with a continued stress on inclusion and equity.
This is to ensure the fruits of development accrue not to a few, not to many but to all Indians.
And this will also mean continuing our attack on corruption.
23. Thirdly, we will continue to make progress on improving the investment climate and Ease of Doing Business.
We want to make India a destination which not only welcomes business but where it is easy to do business.
We have largely achieved the first by drastically liberalizing our foreign direct investment policies.
24. We will continue to strengthen the “Make in India” initiative.
It is not intended for only manufacturing for the domestic market or import substitution.
It is as much about making world-class products and services for the whole globe.
That is why, for us, improvements towards free trade are important.
It is very important for us that developed countries open their markets, not only to goods from countries like India but also to services.
I see this as a win-win proposition for the U.S. and for India.
India is the future human resource powerhouse of the world with a young hard-working population.
In my vision, a partnership between American capital and innovation, and Indian human resources and entrepreneurship can be very powerful.
I am convinced we can strengthen both our economies through such a partnership.
25. We will continue to make our tax policies more predictable.
We have made major strides towards predictability by signing a number of Advance Pricing Agreements with the United States.
We are committed to taking this further.
At the same time, like the U.S., we are cracking down on tax evasion and unfair tax avoidance.
26. We will continue to open up our defence sector.
I am aware that licensing policies can sometimes slow down the process of investing in India’s defence sector.
We are exploring a simpler and more efficient project licensing approach for defence.
It is setting up a locomotive manufacturing plant in the relatively poor state of Bihar.
I expect many more such investments.
27. The river Ganga has a special significance for India.
The ‘Namami Gange” programme to clean the river Ganga is on the verge of taking off.
It will be a big priority over the coming years.
This project offers major opportunities for American companies with their expertise in environmental engineering, water and sewage treatment and the like.
This project is a high priority for my Government and our aim is to restore the Ganga to its pristine glory.
28. Ladies and Gentlemen, we have begun our journey towards a transformed India.
A transformed India, with one sixth of humanity will mean a transformed world.
The journey will be long.
But the progress we have achieved so far, convinces me that we will reach our destination.
I invite you to join us on that journey.
It is a journey which offers the exciting possibility of not only building a better balance sheet for your company but of building a better India, building a better America, and building a better world.
My dear countrymen, this warmth of emotion, this fervour that has been kindled in the hearts of our defence forces, our soldiers this Diwali, should this be confined to only a few occasions?
I had urged them to focus on these children’s future, on their return home.
The sheer volume of students, who appeared in the Board Examinations, is a clear indication that our children from Jammu & Kashmir are committed to attain newer heights of progress, to build a bright future through the medium of education.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I asked people for suggestions for ‘Mann ki Baat’, I can say that almost all the suggestions that were received echoed one theme.
Everyone wanted me to speak in more detail about the 500 & 1000 rupee notes.
I can very well understand the problems you are going through!
But when I see your support, when I look at your co-operation; although numerous efforts are on to misguide you, despite that, and despite witnessing some disturbing incidents, you have whole heartedly comprehended the path of righteousness and truth, you have favourably accepted this step taken in the best national interest.
I distinctly remember, when the Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojana was launched, bank personnel earnestly and zealously shouldered their responsibilities and showed that they could achieve what had not been accomplished during the last 70 years.
Even now, some people think that they can re-introduce into the system, money from corruption, black money, unaccounted wealth and Benami money (money in unknown person’s name), using some route or the other.
One Mr. Aashish has called me up and appreciated the fight against corruption and black money through the action on 500 and 1000 Rupee notes: –
I wish that in Mann Ki Baat, you quote instances of people, who, despite facing hardships, have welcomed this step for the nation’s progress.
I have received a similar call from Mr. Yellappa Velankar Ji from Karnataka: –
For this I thank you from the core of my heart.”
Guests from the bridegroom’s side also gracefully accepted it as their ceremonial welcome.
Imagine the difference – from 3 to 3.5 thousand crores to 13 thousand crores.
You can make a very big contribution in creating a cashless society.
We keep telling with great fanfare the whole world that India is a country where 65% of the population is below the age of 35 years.
You just do one thing, take a resolve today itself that you will yourself become a part of the ‘cashless society’.
You have to voluntarily lend your leadership to this great campaign, this Maha Abhiyan, to create a ‘cashless society’, to eradicate corruption from our country, to abolish the scourge of black money and to help people in overcoming their difficulties and problems.
His son Shriman Amitabh Ji, who has the cleanliness mission running in his veins, has written to me –“Swachchh Tann, Swachchh Mann, Swachchh Bharat, Mera Parichay.
I also thank Shriman Amitabh Ji to connect in such a warm manner with ‘Mann Ki Baat’ and for taking forward the Cleanliness Campaign.
My dear countrymen, now your views and your sentiments on ‘Mann Ki Baat’ though your letters, on MyGov, on NaarendraModiApp keep me constantly connected with you.
India and Germany are large democracies, major economies and important players in regional and global affairs.
Our strategic partnership is based on democratic values and commitment to an open, inclusive and rules-based global order.
I would begin my visit from Meseberg near Berlin in Germany, where Chancellor Merkel has very graciously invited me to hold discussions on issues of regional and global importance.
On 30 May, Chancellor Merkel and I will hold the 4th IGC to review the state of our bilateral relationship.
I would also call on H.E. Dr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Germany is our leading partner in trade, technology and investment.
In Berlin, Chancellor Merkel and I will interact with top business leaders of both the countries to further strengthen our trade and investment ties.
I am confident that this visit will open a new chapter in our bilateral cooperation with Germany and further deepen our Strategic Partnership.
We will discuss ways to enhance bilateral engagement, especially in the economic sphere, and cooperation on international issues of common concern, particularly in combating terrorism.
We seek active participation of Spanish industry in various Indian projects including infrastructure, smart cities, digital economy, renewable energy, defence and tourism.
I will also meet top CEOs of Spanish industry and encourage them to partner with us in our ‘Make in India’ Initiative.
The first meeting of the India-Spain CEOs Forum will be held on the sidelines of my visit.
I look forward to their valuable recommendations for strengthening India-Spain economic partnership.
On 1st June, I will be conducting detailed discussions with President Putin to take forward our dialogue from the last Summit in Goa in October 2016.
With a spotlight on economic ties, both President Putin and I will also be interacting with CEOs from both countries.
On the next day, I will be addressing the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) together with President Putin.
India is the Guest Country at the SPIEF this year.
In a first meeting of its kind, I will also have the opportunity to engage with Governors from various Russian regions to further broad base bilateral cooperation and more actively involve States/Regions and other diversified stakeholders.
At the beginning of my visit, I will go to Piskarovskoye Cemetery to pay homage to those who perished during the siege of Leningrad.
I will also have occasion to visit the world famous State Hermitage Museum and the Institute of Oriental manuscripts.
I greatly look forward to my visit to St. Petersburg in this special year for the bilateral relationship as both countries celebrate the 70th Anniversary of our diplomatic relations.
I will be visiting France from 2-3 June, 2017.
France is our 9th largest investment partner and a key partner in our development initiatives in the area of defence, space, nuclear and renewable energy, urban development and railways.
I am committed to substantially strengthening and advancing our multi-faceted partnership with France.”
The Prime Minister conveyed his best wishes to the newly elected representatives.
He exhorted them to strive for the welfare and upliftment of people.He assured the delegation that he and his Government are committed to the empowerment of the people, and will stand shoulder to shoulder with the local government representatives for the welfare of the State, to fulfil the aspirations of the masses.
He urged the members of the delegation to prioritize people’s interests, as the people have reposed enormous faith and hope on them.
The Prime Ministercongratulated the local representatives for the courage displayed by them in the face of heavy odds; and for successfully participating in the democratic process, despite threats and intimidation.
He assured them of the Government of India’s full support for making the Panchayati Raj model a success, and responsive to the people’s basic necessities and grievances.
Empowerment of grassroots institutions is a significant step in taking Jammu and Kashmir away from the path of violence and secure the rights and development of the local populace.
The J&K Panchayat Act was passed in 1989, but only three of the allotted 25 functions under the Act were actually provided budgetary support.
The Government has now amended the J&K Panchayati Raj Act of 1989 and transferred Rs 2,000 Crore per annum to the Panchayats.

Chairman of the Seoul Peace Prize Cultural Foundation, Mr. Kwon E-hyock
The award belongs to the success that India has achieved in the less than five years, powered by the strengths and skillsof one point three billion Indians.
And so, on their behalf, I humbly accept the Award and express my gratitude.
This award is a recognition of the philosophy that has given the message of वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम which means the entire world is one family.
And, this award is for the people who have always put societal good above individual ambitions.
And, I am honoured that this award is being conferred on me in the year that we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
India remembers the games quite well.
Because they ended on Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday.
But,the games were also an important landmark in world history.
The 1988 Olympics were held at a time of many changes in the world.
The Iran-Iraq War had just ended.
The Geneva Accords relating to the situation in Afghanistan had been signed earlier that year.
The Cold War was ending, and there was great hope that a new golden age will soon Dawn.
And for a while, it did.
Health-care and education outcomes have been improving.
A few weeks before the Seoul Olympics, an organization called Al-Qaeda was formed.
Today, radicalization and terrorism have become globalized and are the biggest threats to global peace and security.
And, millions of people around the world still remain without adequate and quality access to food, shelter,health-care, sanitation, power, and above all, dignity of life.
Clearly, there is a lot more that needs to be done.The solution to the hard-ships we face is in hard work.
And, India is doing her part.
We have been working to improve the well being of the people of India – who form one-sixth of humanity.
India is today the fastest growing large economy in the world with strong economic fundamentals.
This has been possible because of the major economic changes that we have introduced.
Flag-ship initiatives such as ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Clean India’ have contributed to visible socio-economic growth.
In all our efforts, we are guided by Mahatma Gandhi’s teaching that we should recall the face of the poorest and the weakest person that we have ever seen and ask ourselves if the step that we plan is going to be of any benefit to that person.
We live in an increasingly connected world.
As the third largest economy, our growth and prosperity will inevitably contribute to global growth and development.
We are committed to make a peaceful, stable and economically inter-linked world.
India, as a responsible member of the international community, has also been in the fore-front of our collective fight against climate change.
Despite having a historically low carbon foot-print, India has been playing an active role in the global fight against climate change.
At the domestic level, this has been done by unveiling a National Action Plan to reduce carbon emissions, increase forest cover, and replacing traditional carbon fuels with renewable energy supplies.
We are one of the largest troop contributing countries for UN peace-keeping operations.
And, we are proud to have been able to contribute to peace on the Korean peninsula.
We have extended a helping hand to countries in need and participated actively in humanitarian work and disaster relief.
We have carried out operations in conflict zones and rescued not only Indians but also nationals of many other countries.
We have been an active and considerate development partner for other developing countries, with our guiding principle being to help in developing their physical and social infrastructure.
Through these efforts, we seek to ensure that the benefits of a globalised and inter-connected world are equally experienced by all.
Over the past few years, my Government has renewed interaction and forged new partnerships across continents.
In the East Asian context, we have redefined our engagements with countries in the region, including with Republic of Korea, under our Act East Policy.
I am glad to hear an echo of our approach in President Moon’s New Southern Policy.
The people of India have practiced the concept of peace and harmonious co-existence for thousands of years.
With hundreds of languages and dialects, many states, and major religions, India is proud to be one of the most diverse nations in the world.
We are proud that ours is a land where people of all faiths, beliefs, and communities can prosper.
We are proud that ours is a society based not only on tolerance, but on celebration of differences and diverse cultures.
Like Korea, India has also suffered the pain of cross-border strife.
Our endeavour towards peaceful development has only too often been de-railed by cross-border terrorism.
President Moon deserves all the praise for the role he has played in overcoming the legacy of mutual distrust and suspicion between the D.P.R.K. and the international community, and bringing them to the discussion table.
This is no small achievement.
I state again my Government’s strong support to the ongoing dialogue process between the two Koreas and between the U.S.A. and D.P.R.K.
Friends, I would like to end by quoting a portion of the 1988 Olympics Theme Song, because it perfectly captures the hopeful spirit for a better tomorrow for all of us: Hand in hand, we standAll across the land,We can make this world,A better place in which to live.

PM replies to the motion of thanks on President’s Address in the Rajya Sabha
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today replied to the motion of thanks on the President’s Address in the Rajya Sabha.
He said that several members have shared their views and there was considerable discussion on demonetization.
The Prime Minister said that the fight against corruption and black money is not a political fight, and it is not to single out any particular party.
Shri Narendra Modi said that there is today a horizontal divide – in which – on one side are the people of India and the Union Government, and on the other side are a group of political leaders.
He said that we should continuously move forward for practical change, and never underestimate the strength of our country.
The Prime Minister said that institutions should be kept above politics, and the Reserve Bank of India should not be dragged into controversy.
The Prime Minister said that under the “Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat” initiative, we all have the opportunity to learn about and appreciate the culture and capabilities of various parts of the country.
He said that Rashtra Dharma is above every Dharma (religion).
The Prime Minister lauded the role of saints and said it is our heritage that India has given many Saints and Munis who have led the society towards Nation building.
Prime Minister welcomed Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin to India on his third visit this year.

Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin discussed the steady expansion and diversification of bilateral ties, particularly noting the standout collaboration in the energy sector and the common pursuit of high- technology cooperation.
It is not every day that one meets a prime minister representing 1.2 billion people, one considered a superstar at home and abroad.
Maybe that is why the meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi felt so special.
Despite the disparity in the sizes of the two countries, the relationship between them is one of equals, as far as he is concerned.
Modi is a different kind of leader.
With sky-high popularity among Indians, he can say what he wants and push for the reforms he seeks.
He has tried to move India forward and make it a global leader.
For him, the path to achieving those goals passes through Israel.
This should be a badge of honor for all Israelis.
That is his big challenge.
He takes immense pride in his success in pulling himself up by the bootstraps after being born into poverty.
Exuding confidence, Modi shares with me a local dictum he uses as his mantra: “Sarvajan Hitay Sarvajan Sukhay, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.”
Throughout the interview, he makes a conscious effort to point out the deep ties between the Indian and Israeli peoples.
He believes the two nations are soulmates.
They share a spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that gives the partnership its own dimension.
He considers this a very important part of his trip, his way of showing his respect to the local Indian community.
Q. What do you know about Israel?
Have you ever visited Israel?
“I share the view of many of my fellow citizens about Israel.
Many tech-based inventions have their roots in Israeli universities and laboratories and have benefited humankind.
These include articles ranging from USB flash drives to cherry tomatoes.
Q. Why have you made a decision to go ahead with this historic visit?
“Bilateral ties between our countries have always been strong.
In fact, over the years, they have been continuously expanding and diversifying.
In the recent past, the steady strengthening of our ties has begun finding reflection and reinforcement in high-level visits.
You would have noticed that the frequency of exchanges has gone up over the last three years.
No Indian president or prime minister had visited Israel before our president visited in 2015.
“My forthcoming visit reminds us of the deep and centuries old connect between our societies.
It is in line with our view that our ties should be reflected in all spheres of our engagement and backed by regular high-level contact.
Q. Does this decision imply a more pro-Israel posture in the U.N.?
We remain engaged with all our partners, including Israel, in finding optimal outcomes at the U.N. and other multilateral fora that reflect our commonly shared priorities and concerns.
India is not in favor of singling out any country at the U.N.”
Q. Does India still consider itself unaligned with either the West or the East?
“We believe in the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,’ which means ‘the world is one family.’
We want to engage constructively with both the East and the West.
Q. Are Israel and India facing the same threat of terrorism?
“Terrorism is a global menace.
India and Israel are not immune to it either.
Divisive forces across our border are trying to disrupt the unity of our nation.
These troublemakers often misuse religion as a tool to misguide youth in our country and our regions.
Terrorism should not be equated with any particular religion.
India and Israel could cooperate even more closely and complement each other’s efforts to fight with the menace of terrorism.”
Q. Is this a reset or an upgrade of relations?
“My visit has its own significance as this is the first time ever that an Indian PM is visiting Israel.
I am confident that my visit will lead to further strengthening of our relations in different areas and also open up new priorities for cooperation.”
Q. Will you agree to visit Jerusalem and the Western Wall like President Donald Trump?
“The principal objective of my visit is to deepen bilateral relations between India and Israel.
I am sure I will visit Jerusalem.
Elements of my visit and its program is being so arranged so that we can focus to taking forward our partnership with Israel in all the spheres, including technology and innovation links, agriculture and efficient resource use. ”
Q. What is your position on the question of sovereignty in Jerusalem?
Will India move its embassy?
“We believe in a two-state solution in which both Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist peacefully.
A final-status agreement should respect the sentiments and address demands of all affected parties.
The key to finding a solution to this issue lies with the affected parties.
India supports all efforts to find an acceptable solution to all the pending issues, including Jerusalem.
I assume the question refers to our embassy in Tel Aviv.
We will take a decision on that after both sides have come to an agreement on Jerusalem.”
Q. Your biography, as a man who grew up in poverty and climbed up the ladder with hard work to become the country’s head of government, is impressive by any measure.
But despite your past, you are an ardent supporter of the capitalist system and want to liberalize the economy.
I, and my government work with the motto of ‘Together with all, development for all.’
We want our youth to become not just job-seekers but job-givers.
We will adopt all measures necessary to unlock the innovation and entrepreneurial potential of our youth.
My yardstick for supporting or advocating any course of action is the net benefit or value it brings to the lives of our people.
And when this consideration is put first, the results can be deeply rewarding.
Israel could be a technology partner in this process of transformation.
Israel’s capabilities offer a good match for our flagship schemes like Clean Ganga [the effort to clean the Ganges River] and Smart Cities.
Israeli technologies could also be used to improve the quality of lives of hundreds of thousands of people in our country if Israeli innovators remodel their products according to the needs of our rural population.
It is important to understand market trends among the rural sections.”
Q. What is the difference between the approach Israelis and Indians have when it comes to business, agriculture and other fields?
Q. How can we describe to the average person what innovation ties are there between Israelis and Indians?
Q. What kind of Israeli imports does India seek?
“We are not looking at a traditional import-export relationship with Israel.
It is more than a buyer-seller relationship.
We are more interested in a tech-based partnership with an emphasis on ‘Make in India.’
The Israeli industry has been fairly positive to many of our flagship schemes like ‘Clean Ganga.’
There is tremendous scope for deepening the extent of partnership in India’s flagship schemes.”
PM Shri Narendra Modi has extended his greetings to people of Maharashtra on their statehood day.
PM said, “Best wishes to the people of Maharashtra on their Statehood Day.
I pray for the continued progress and prosperity of Maharashtra.
The total estimated cost will be Rs.1,009.6 crore.
Following is the text of the Prime Minister’s inaugural address:-
It is a great pleasure and privilege to participate in the 21st International Conference on frontiers in yoga research and its applications.
Iam deeply grateful to Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhan Sansthan for organizing this conference.
Vivekananda’s vision was a synthesis of a deep reading of the Indian and Western thought, and drew its spirit from our ancient philosophy and knowledge.
He not only made a unique contribution to the spiritual revival of India, he also placed our timeless wisdom before the world.
He had a deep understanding of the beauty of human diversity and spoke passionately for unity in our world.
This is a particularly special year for the science of yoga.
On June 21, more than a million people in 192 countries came together to celebrate the first International Day of Yoga.
The overwhelming global support is a mark of Yoga’s growing international popularity.
It is also a symbol of the universal aspiration for health and well being.
It reflects the shared global desire for balance between human and Mother Nature; and, peace and harmony between people and nations.
Above all, it demonstrated once again the capacity of people from different cultures to reach beyond the familiar boundaries of their lives and unite in pursuit of a larger good.
It is this spirit of unity that demonstrates the timeless science of yoga.
When it comes to a sustainable future for our world, a healthy habit and happier people, a change in our way of life that influences the choices we make as individuals, nations and global community is important.
This is a recognition that is dawning on the world.
In 2008, 80 percent of deaths due to these diseases were in developing countries, up from 40 percent in 1990.
By 2030, low-income countries will have eight times more deaths attributed to NCDs than high-income countries.
In India, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and other Non Communicable Diseases are estimated to account for 60% of all deaths.
These diseases account for about 40% of all hospital stays and roughly 35% of all recorded outpatient visits.
We face the tragedy of productive lives cut short and families that must deal with untimely loss; the huge toll on the economy; and, the excessive burden on the over-stretched health system.
Some studies have estimated that India stands to lose about 4.58 trillion dollars before 2030 due to non communicable diseases and mental health conditions.
So, we must address the question of psychological state of our existence as much as we try to advance our physical and material life.
This is where the role of Yoga is paramount.
Across the world, there are moving stories of transformed lives and rekindled hopes due to Yoga.
The prediction of Shri Aurobindo that “Indian Yoga … is potentially one of these dynamic elements of the future life of humanity” is coming true.
This discipline was not originally considered or conceived as system of medicine.
But, because Yoga is about aholistic lifestyle and the physical, mental, intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual harmony, it has profound health benefits.
It fits well with the change in the way that world increasingly defines health.
We are no longer satisfied with just preventing and managing diseases.
People now demand promotion of wellness, which is a healthy balance of the mind, body and spirit.
We now increasingly hear voices calling for holistic treatment, which means dealing not just with the immediate ailment, but with the complete person, physically, psychologically, socially, and spiritually.
Traditional Indian systems are rooted in looking at human beings in totality.
They see the link between Adhi or problems at the mind level and Vyadhi or problems at the physical level.
And, they are without side effects.
As I argued at the Science Congress this morning, like traditional knowledge, science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of Nature.
So, we must recognize that science, as we see it, does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world.
And, we must remember that the western system of thought, from Hippocrates to Percival to Edison have expressed views on health that are not fundamentally different from the philosophy of the Indian System.
So, along with the accumulated wisdom and experience gathered over the ages, we must also apply the techniques and methods of modern science to test and validate results, assure quality and explain benefits.
And, this is why we are placing emphasis on our efforts to increase awareness, acceptance and adoption of AYUSH System of Medicine.
And, in doing so, we will create better wellness among people, rely more on local resources and reduce healthcare costs.
We will also reduce the social and economic costs to our society and promote a more environment friendly healthcare system.
I am not here to advocate the supremacy of one system over another.
I believe that humanity is wealthier for its diversity.
Civilisations, cultures and countries have enriched each other by sharing their knowledge and wisdom.
And, we can progress more by learning from each other.
It is in this spirit that Swami Vivekananda called for combining the best from the East and the West.
So, it must be in the area of healthcare.
My vision for healthcare is an integrated system that understands and builds on the best and most effective of different traditions.
It addresses issues that are very close to my heart.
Modern systems of medicine have transformed healthcare; screening, detection and diagnosis of diseases.
Use of technology has reduced barriers to accessing health care, and improved our understanding of disease patterns.
Their popularity is growing.
Yoga is now a global heritage.
And, the world is embracing traditional Indian medicine with great enthusiasm.
So, we look to you at this conference to define the path forward in the service of humanity.
I hope that health professionals, policymakers, government organizations and Industry will bridge the distance between the various forms of medical systems.
I hope that you will to integrate yoga and traditional Indian medicine more closely into our healthcare system and make wellness a part of life for all in India and rest of the world.

PM says, GES is a unique opportunity for bringing together entrepreneurs and start ups with global leaders
“India and US will co-host the Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Hyderabad from 28-30 November 2017.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the newly constructed Western Court Annexe in New Delhi.
This building will serve as transit accommodation for Members of Parliament.
The Prime Minister said that when MPs are newly elected, they have to stay in hotels and this makes headlines.
However, he said that what is often missed is that previous occupants overstay beyond the designated time.
The Prime Minister asserted that the Union Government is walking on the path shown by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
At the core of Dr. Ambedkar’s ideals is harmony and togetherness, he said.
He added that working for the poorest of the poor is the Government’s mission.

PM launches development works, addresses public meeting in Varanasi
The Prime Minister felicitated select beneficiaries of Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, and handed over LPG connections to select Ujjwala beneficiaries.
Speaking on the occasion, he urged people to send their messages to soldiers on Diwali.
He said the Union Government has focused on timely completion of projects, and has worked towards ensuring that not only are foundations laid, but projects are also inaugurated on time.
He said the real aim of Government initiatives is proper execution and touching people’s lives.
The Prime Minister spoke about environment friendly initiatives, and the Government’s new vision for the Indian Railways, which can emerge as a growth engine for the economy.
He said people in India too would be pleasantly surprised to see the cow being given such importance as a means of economic empowerment in villages, in faraway Rwanda.
He spoke of the similarity in rural life in the two countries.
The program is based on the premise that providing a dairy cow to poor Girinka Programme transforms livelihoods, reconciles communities improving agricultural productivity through the use of manure as fertilizers which would lead to improving soil quality and reducing erosion through the planting of grasses and trees.
Since its introduction in 2006 hundreds of thousands have received cows through the Girinka program.
By June 2016, a total of 248,566 cows had been distributed to poor households.
The program also aimed at promoting unity and reconciliation among Rwandans based on the cultural principle that if a cow is given from one person to another, it establishes trust and respect between the giver and beneficiary.
While this was not an original goal of Girinka, it has evolved to become a significant aspect of the program.
The program also follows a certain criteria in choosing who the beneficiaries should be.
As per a Govt. of Rwanda official, they mainly look at those very poor vulnerable families that don’t own a cow but do have land that can be used to grow grass for feeding the cows.
The beneficiary should be in position to construct an animal shed or willing to join others in community to construct a communal cow shed to be jointly used with the rest.

Your Excellency Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,
Distinguished Guests,
Ladies & Gentlemen,
It is a great honour for me to be back in Japan on my second visit as Prime Minister.
The people of India have long hailed the dedication and dynamism; vigour and vitality; and achievements of the Japanese people.
There is much to learn and absorb from Japan’s experience.
India and Japan have long enjoyed close and friendly ties.
Our societies share deep linkages rooted in the thought streams of hinduism and buddhism.
We both value the need to maintain balance between economic growth and preserving our civilizational ethos.
Our relations are strengthened by common values of openness, democracy and respect for the rule of law.
Today, our Special Strategic and Global Partnership is marked by a growing convergence of economic and strategic issues.
There is also a lot that we can do together as close partners, not just for the benefit of our societies, but also for the region and the whole world.
Our partnership promotes the virtues of dialogue and good neighbourliness in our region.
Our capacities could also combine to respond to both, the opportunities and challenges that we jointly face in present times.
And, together with the global community we can, and we must, combat the rising threats of radicalization, extremism and terrorism.
Japan has always been a valuable partner in India’s journey to economic prosperity, infrastructure development, capacity building and technology advancement.
The scope and scale of our co-operation extends to diverse fields.
Our economic links continue to flourish.
Trade ties continue to grow.
And, Investments from Japan are on the rise.
Japanese companies have much to gain by participating in our flagship development initiatives.
We, in turn, have much to gain from Japan’s unparalleled status as the leader in technology and innovation.
A welcome feature of our ties is the increase in contacts and co-operation between states in India and prefectures in Japan.
It is a reflection of the high priority that we accord to Japan in our worldview.
Our ties are nurtured by the fountain of goodwill and mutual admiration that our two peoples have for one another.
And, are led most ably by the strong leadership of Excellency Abe.
Without doubt, our destinies are interlinked.
The ocean waters of the Indo-Pacific that lap the coast of Japan also form the surf that breaks on the shores of India.
To the continued good health and personal well-being of Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress of Japan, To the profound success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the friendly people of Japan and each one of you present here tonight,
To the ever-lasting friendship between India and Japan,
He attended the Closing Ceremony of the Birth Centenary Celebration of the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche in Leh.
At the same event, he unveiled a plaque to mark the commencement of work on the Zojila Tunnel.
Addressing a large gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister recalled the rich contribution of the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche.
He added that the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche distinguished himself as an outstanding diplomat.
These projects will have a positive impact on the people of the state, he added.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has saluted Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev on their martyrdom day.
In the prime of their youth, these 3 brave men sacrificed their lives so that generations after them can breathe the air of freedom”, the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved MoU on passenger cruise services on the coastal and protocol routes between India and Bangladesh for starting regular movement of passengers and tourists in water crafts between the two countries.

It will also generate employment opportunities for the people of India and Bangladesh.
The Bill would provide for a comprehensive resolution framework for specified financial sector entities to deal with bankruptcy situation in banks, insurance companies and financial sector entities.
The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance, Bill 2017 when enacted, will pave the way for setting up of the Resolution Corporation.
It would lead to repeal or amendment of resolution-related provisions in sectoral Acts as listed in Schedules of the Bill.
It will also result in the repealing of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961 to transfer the deposit insurance powers and responsibilities to the Resolution Corporation.
The Resolution Corporation would protect the stability and resilience of the financial system; protecting the consumers of covered obligations up to a reasonable limit; and protecting public funds, to the extent possible.
The Government has recently enacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“Code”) for the insolvency resolution of non- financial entities.
The proposed Bill complements the Code by providing a resolution framework for the financial sector.
Once implemented, this Bill together with the Code will provide a comprehensive resolution framework for the economy.
The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017 seeks to give comfort to the consumers of financial service providers in financial distress.
It also aims to inculcate discipline among financial service providers in the event of financial crises by limiting the use of public money to bail out distressed entities.
It would help in maintaining financial stability in the economy by ensuring adequate preventive measures, while at the same time providing the necessary instruments for dealing with an event of crisis.
The Bill aims to strengthen and streamline the current framework of deposit insurance for the benefit of a large number of retail depositors.
Further, this Bill seeks to decrease the time and costs involved in resolving distressed financial entities.
I fondly recall the modest launch of this event in 2003.
Since then it has been a very successful journey.
I express my gratitude to the partner countries and organisations – a list which includes Japan, Canada, USA, UK, Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, France, Poland, Sweden, Singapore and UAE.
You should also visit the trade show and the exhibition where hundreds of companies have showcased their products and processes.
Gujarat, the land of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, also represents the business spirit of India.
Gujarat is currently in the midst of the Kite Festival.
May the kites inspire us all to fly high.
As I have often said India’s strength lies in the three Ds: Democracy, Demography and Demand.
Some people say that democracy cannot deliver effective and fast track governance.
But we have seen in the last two and a half years that it is possible to deliver quick results in a democratic set up as well.
Coming to Demography, ours is a nation of vibrant youth.
We are the second largest English speaking country.
On the Demand front, our rising middle class offers a huge domestic market.
Nature has been kind to us.
The richness of our culture and its living symbols is unique.
All this helps ensure a good quality of life, at relatively low cost.
Our Government was elected first and foremost on the promise to provide clean Governance and end the prevailing regime of corruption and nepotism.
To give you some examples, we are bringing a shift:
· From relation based Governance to system based Governance; · From discretionary administration to policy based administration; · From random interference to technological intervention; · From favouritism to level playing field; · From Informal economy to formal economy.
In doing this, digital technology has played a key role.
I have often said that e-governance is easy and effective Governance.
I have also emphasized the need for policy driven Governance.
Online processes help bring speed and openness in decision making.
Towards this end, we are working to adopt and absorb newer technologies, to bring about transparency, and to end discretion.
Over the last two and a half years, we have worked relentlessly to realise India’s potential, and to set right the economy.
The results have been encouraging.
There has been substantial improvement in key macro-economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, current account deficit as well as foreign investments.
World Bank, IMF and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days.
In 2014-15, India contributed 12.5 per cent of global growth.
Its contribution to global growth is sixty eight per cent higher, than its share of the world economy.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the National Company Law Tribunal, a new arbitration framework and a new IPR regime are all in place.
New commercial courts have also been set up.
These are just a few examples of the direction in which we are going.
My government is strongly committed to continue the reform of the Indian economy.
We have placed the highest emphasis on Ease of Doing Business.
We have taken decisive steps to ease licensing processes, and rationalize provisions and procedures relating to clearances, returns, and inspections.
We are monitoring implementation of hundreds of action points across various sectors, aimed at improving the regulatory framework.
This is part of our promise of Good Governance.
The outcomes of our efforts are visible in India’s global rankings on various indicators.
A number of global reports and assessments over the last two years have shown that India has improved its policies, practices and hence its economic profile.
India is ranked third in the list of top prospective host economies for 2016-18 in the World Investment Report 2016 released by UNCTAD.
Our rank also improved by thirty two positions in World Economic Forum’s ‘Global Competitiveness Report 2015-16 and 2016-17’;
We have moved up sixteen ranks in the ‘Global Innovation Index 2016’ brought out by WIPO and other institutions;
We have moved up nineteen positions in the World Bank’s ‘Logistics Performance Index of 2016.’
Every day, we are further rationalising our policies and procedures, to make it simple for businesses to establish and grow.
This unleashing of the youth power is heartening.
The number of countries from where FDI is coming in, and the sectors in which they are being routed have also diversified in the last two years.
India is now the leading recipient of capital investment in the Asia-Pacific.
But the story does not end here.
India has left every other country behind in terms of providing return on investment.
In 2015, India has risen to first position in the Baseline Profitability Index.
It is directed towards making India a global hub for manufacturing, design and innovation.
‘Make in India’ has celebrated its second anniversary recently.
I am delighted to share that we have become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth largest previously.
Our Gross Value Added in manufacturing has recorded a growth of nine per cent in 2015-16.
All this is helping us expand the job market and raise the purchasing power of our people.
But the real potential is even higher.
To give you a few examples: India’s Food Processing Industry is expected to increase almost five fold in the next ten years.
Similarly, India’s low vehicle penetration makes it one of the world’s most attractive auto markets.
We are taking a leap towards next generation infrastructure: in both core and social sectors; in both rural and urban areas.
This includes Freight Corridors, Industrial Corridors, High Speed and Metro Rail projects, Logistics Parks, Smart Cities, Coastal Zones, regional airports, water, sanitation and energy initiatives.
Our per capita electricity consumption must rise.
Even as we do so, we are committed to promoting renewable energy.
Ultimately, this is what India has stood for since ages.
Welcome to India: · The land of tradition and tranquillity; · The land of empathy and excitement; · The land of experiment and enterprise. · The land of openings and opportunities;

“This is a major step towards making India a powerful nation with the schemes touching the lives of the people.
This budget takes care of the interest of several sectors- from farmer welfare to middle class, from income tax relief to infrastructure, from manufacturing to MSME, from housing to healthcare and from the increased pace of development to the New India.
Friends, the development schemes launched by the government have made a positive impact on every individual of the country.
The benefits of Aayushman Bharat Yojana will reach out to 50 crore poor people.
Over 9 Crore Families have got the benefits of Swachh Bharat Mission.
More than 6 Crore families have received free gas connection under UjwalaYojana 1.5 Crore families have got a pucca house of their own under Pradhan MantriAwasYojana.
Now in this budget, over 12 crore farmers and their families, 3 crores middle class taxpayers and 30-40 crore laborers will be directly benefitted.
This large group is now aspiring to fulfill its dreams and give an impetus to the development of the Nation.
Government has shown is commitment to provide support and give wings to the hopes and aspirations of this rising middle class.
Our Government has met this demand pending for so many years.
Friends, different Governments have come out with different plans for the farmers.
However, except for 2-3 crore farmers from the upper level, a large number of farmers are not in its ambit.
Now,PM KisanNidhi is coming up, also being called PM-KisanYojna will help the farmers who have land 5 acres or below.
This has been a historic step since independence for the welfare of farmers.
Our Government is taking many steps for the farmers.
Areas related to agrarian and rural life such as animal husbandry, cow’s welfare, separate department of fisheries have also been taken care of.
National Kamdhenu Mission and separate department of fisheries will help increase the livelihood opportunities for crores of farmers.
It will help fishermen.
Our earnest effort is to empower the farmer, provide machinery and resources to double his income.
The decisions today will provide an impetus to this mission.
Friends, India is developing in different spheres.
New schemes are coming up, new areas are being explored and the number of people engaged in these fields has grown manifold.
However, the unorganised sector- be it the labourers, household workers, agricultural labourers or manual thelawalas, a large cross section of the society has been neglected.
Pradhan MantriShram Yogi Man DhanYojna will be a major support for them after the age of 60 years.
They will not only will get the benefits of Ayushman Bharat Yojna, Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojna, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojna, Pradhan MantriAwasYojna and other welfare schemes, but also receive pension to meet their daily expenses.
Brothers and Sisters, our Government has been making efforts to reach out to people at the last mile of development.
We have decided to set up a Welfare Board for nomadic communities like Madaris, Snake charmers, Banzaras, Gadiyalohars etc.
I am hopeful that after proper recognition, the benefits of development will reach out to these communities at a faster pace.
Friends, we have made some forward movement on having a separate Ministry for traders and business people.
DIPP has been restructured with a special mandate to meet the requirements of the business people, traders and other officials.
Now this department will be known as Department for Promotion of Industries and Internal Trade.
I am happy that this budget has incorporated schemes keeping in mind the requirements and targets by the end of next decade.
This budget will empower the poor, will give a boost to the farmer, dignity for the labourers, fulfil the aspirations of the middle class, respect the honest tax payer, empower the traders and enhance the speed of infrastructure development.
This budget will energise 130 crore people of the country towards meeting the targets of New India.
It is all pervasive, touching the lives of all and all inclusive.
It is dedicated to the development of all.
Once again, many-many thanks to my friend Arun Ji and Piyushji and his team for an excellent budget.”

Distinguished Nobel Laureates,
Dr. Goran Hansson, Vice-President of the Nobel Foundation,
Dear scientists,
Ladies and gentlemen!
Let me first congratulate the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, the Government of Gujarat and the Nobel Media, who have brought this exhibition to Science City for five weeks.
I declare the exhibition open and hope you will all have an opportunity to experience it.
The Nobel Prize is the world’s recognition at the highest level for creative ideas, thought and work on fundamental science.
Earlier, there have been occasions when one, two or three Nobel Laureates have visited India and had interactions with students and scientists in a limited manner.
But, today, we are making history by having a galaxy of Nobel Laureates in Gujarat.
I extend a hearty welcome to all the Laureates present here.
You are valued friends of India.
Some of you have been here earlier several times.
One of you was born here and actually grew up in Vadodara!
I am delighted to see so many of our young students here today.
I ask all of you to urge all your friends and family to visit the Science City over the coming weeks.
Our students will cherish this extraordinary experience of interacting with you.
It will inspire them to undertake new and significant challenges that hold the key to our shared sustainable future.
I am very hopeful that this exhibition and this Series will become a strong link between you and our students, science-teachers and our scientists.
Our vision in Science and Technology Is to make sure that opportunity is available to all our youth.
That training and future preparedness should make our youth employable in the best places.
That India should be a great science destination.
That we should take major inspirational challenges such as deep sea exploration and Cyber Systems.
We have a plan that will take this vision through action.
Our scientists have been asked to develop programmes on science teaching in our schools across the country.
This will also involve training teachers.
At the next level they have been asked to create new programmes both in skilling and high-tech training.
These programmes will make you employable in the new knowledge economy and make you effective entrepreneurs and thinking scientists.
You will be able to compete for positions and jobs here and anywhere in the world.
Next, our scientists will link our laboratories in cities.
You can share ideas, seminars and resources and equipment.
This will allow us to do more and better collaborative science.
Our science agencies will expand science-driven entrepreneurship and commercialisation in a big way in each state according to local needs.
Your start-ups and industry can then compete globally.
These seeds must be planted this year and we will then see fruits come steadily.
My young friends, you are the future of India and the world.
India offers an enabling and unique opportunity of a large demographic dividend and the best teachers.
Young students, you are the streams that charge the wells of knowledge and expertise.
Your training and your future is what this is all about.
Thanks to science and technology, the human race has flourished.
Large numbers are enjoying a quality of life unparalleled in human history.
Yet India has a great challenge to raise many from poverty.
You will be scientists soon and must not neglect this challenge.
The maturity of our science will also be judged by a responsible treatment of our planet by the wise use of Science and Technology.
You will be scientists soon and the guardians of the planet.
We must have clear outcomes from the Nobel Exhibition and the Science City.
Globally, science & technology has emerged as one of the major drivers of socio-economic development.
In the fast growing Indian economy, there are increasing expectations for scientific interventions.
There are three outcomes I would like to see from the Nobel Prize series.
First, follow up with students and their teachers.
The students and teachers here have come through a national ‘Ideathon’ competition and hail from all over the country.
Do not lose track of them.
During the exhibition period, you may also have sessions for school teachers from all over Gujarat.
Second, stimulate entrepreneurship locally.
There is a great entrepreneurial zeal amongst our youth.
Our science ministries have incubators here in Gujarat.
In the next five weeks, you should have a workshop on how cutting edge science and technology-driven start-ups can be boosted.
I am told that there are about ten Nobel Prize winning discoveries that have gone into the making of a smart phone.
Prize winning Physics can both save electricity bills and the planet.
The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics was for the BLUE LED.
This came from basic research by three Japanese scientists Akasaki, Amano and Nakamura.
When combined with the previously known RED and GREEN LED, white light devices can be made that last a hundred thousand hours.
There are many such exciting discoveries being made that we can apply through enterprise.
Third, impact on society
Many Nobel Prize winning discoveries have had a huge impact on our society through health and agriculture.
For example, precision medicine using the tools of gene-technologies is now a reality.
We must use this tool to study cancer, diabetes and infectious diseases.
India is already a generics and bio-similar leader, with a major hub in Gujarat, but we must now strive to become a leader in new bio-tech discoveries as well.
I am happy that this Exhibition has been planned at the Science City which connects community to science.
It is an ideal platform to engage citizens to learn about solutions to global challenges we face.
We will strive to make this Science City a truly attractive, world-class place for young students and science teachers from all over the country and the world to come and be inspired by the exhibits.
Centre and State should collaborate and take up this challenge this year.
My young friends!
The Laureates represent the peaks of science and you must learn from them.
But remember that the peak rises from great mountain ranges and does not stand alone.
You are the foundation and the future of India.
You should build new ranges from which the peaks will arise.
If we focus on the foundation, in our schools and colleges and through teachers all miracles can happen.
There will be hundreds of peaks from India.
But, if we neglect the hard work at the base no peak will magically appear.
Be inspired and be daring, have courage and be your own person and not imitative.
That is how our honoured guests succeeded and that is what you should learn from them.
I take this opportunity to thank the Nobel Media Foundation, the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India and the Government of Gujarat for organising such an innovative programme.
I wish this exhibition a grand success and I am sure that you will all benefit from it.

That too, on the auspicious occasion of Maha-Shivratri.
There are many festivals, but this one is pre-fixed with “Maha.”
There are many Mantras, but the Mantra which is identified with Lord Shiva, is called Maha-Mrityunjayi Mantra.
Such is the glory of Lord Shiva.
Maha-Shivratri symbolizes a union of divinity with a purpose, of overcoming darkness and injustice.
It inspires us to be courageous and fight for good.
It marks the shift of seasons, from the cold to the lively spring and brightness.
Maha-Shivratri celebrations go on for the entire night.
This symbolizes a spirit of vigilance- that we have to protect nature and mould our activities in sync with our ecological surroundings.
From Somnath to Vishwanath, from Kedarnath to Rameshwaram and from Kashi to Coimbatore where we have gathered, Lord Shiva is everywhere.
Like crores of Indians across the length and breadth of the nation, I too feel delighted to be a part of celebrations of Maha-Shivratri.
Standing here before this 112-feet face of Adiyogi and the Yogeshwar Linga, we are experiencing a colossal presence enveloping everyone in this space.
The essence of Yoga has not changed.
And I say this because it is of utmost importance to preserve this essence.
Otherwise, we may just have to discover a new Yoga to re-discover the soul and essence of Yoga.
Yoga is the catalytic agent, ushering the transformation from Jiva to Shiva.
Oneness with our families, with the society we live in, with fellow humans, with all the birds, animals and trees with whom we share our beautiful planet…this is Yoga.
India is a land of unparalleled diversity.
India’s diversity can be seen, heard, felt, touched and tasted.
The diversity has been India’s greatest strength and has also brought India together.
Think of Lord Shiva and the picture that comes to mind is that of his majestic presence at Mount Kailash, in the mighty Himalayas.
Think of Goddess Parvati and you remember the beautiful Kanyakumari, which is surrounded by the vast oceans.
The ‘Vahan’ of Lord Ganesh is the mouse.
We are well aware of the frosty relations between a snake and a mouse.
Yet, they live together.
Similarly, the ‘Vahan’ of Kartikeya is the peacock.
Peacocks and snakes are supposed to harbor great enmity.
Even then, they live together.
The family of Lord Shiva is diverse yet the spirit of harmony and unity is vibrant.
Diversity is not a cause of conflict for us.
We accept it and embrace it whole heartedly.
Truth is one, sages call it by different names.
We have been living these virtues since our childhood and that is why compassion, kindness, brotherhood and harmony are naturally a part of us.
Unfortunately, there are a select few, who in order to hide their own ignorance, take a very rigid view and destroy any scope of welcoming new thoughts and experiences.
The progress of humanity is incomplete without the empowerment of women.
They shattered stereotypes, broke barriers and became trendsetters.
You would be interested to know, that in India we say –नारी तू नारायणी, नारी तू नारायणी – woman is a manifestation of the divine.
That is also why perhaps Sadhguru insists that one takes the oath of being a mother to the world.
A mother is someone who is unconditionally inclusive.
The changing lifestyles of the 21st century have brought their own set of challenges.
It gives me immense sadness, one that I cannot describe in words, when I read about people taking to substance abuse and alcohol because they are not at peace with themselves.
Today, the whole world wants peace, not just peace from wars and conflict but peace of the mind.
There is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps combat stress and chronic conditions.
It would be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.
You may see people twist and turn their bodies in many sorts of fashion.
But they are not all yogis.
Be it Korea or Canada, Sweden or South Africa- in every part of the world the rays of the sun were welcomed by Yogis, engaged in the practice of Yoga.
Yoga has the potential to herald in a new Yuga (a new era)- a Yuga of peace, compassion, brotherhood and all-round progress of the human race.
One truly remarkable thing that Sadhguru has done is he has made yogis out of ordinary, common people.
People who stay with their families and work in the world, but who are living at the peaks within themselves – undergoing intense and wonderful experiences on a daily basis.
Wherever one is, in whatever situation one is placed, one can be a yogi.
I see so many radiant and joyous faces here.
I see people working with utmost love and care, paying attention to the smallest of details.
My gratitude to Sadhguru for bringing this to us.
Thank you very much. प्रणाम, वाणकम

Excellency Hadid Adel ,the Head of Farhingstan
Dr Janati, the Minister of Cultural Affairs of Iran,
The wise words of Dr. Adel and Dr. Janati before me have set the tone for this Conference.
Your conference is most ideally timed.
It is an occasion to recall and renew our centuries old association.
It is also a perfect response to the those who preach radical thoughts in our societies.
It also fulfils a responsibility to familiarize our younger generations with the beauty and riches of our cultural heritage.
No one is more qualified to shoulder this task than this gathering of learned men and scholars.
I must particularly congratulate Dr. Adel, who has been ahead of the curve in realizing this need.
His ongoing project to bring out Encyclopaedia on the Indian sub-continent in Persian would be of great service to researchers and scholars.
It is indeed an honour and privilege to be amidst such a galaxy of scholars and thinkers of Iran.
In the world of today, political pundits talk of strategic convergence.
But, India and Iran are two civilizations that celebrate the meeting of our great cultures.
The rare Persian manuscript Kalileh-wa-Dimneh, released just now, captures the close historical links between India and Iran.
It is remarkable how the simple stories of the Indian classics of Jataka and Panchatantra became the Persian Kalileh-wa-Dimneh.
It is a classic example of exchange and travel of cultural ideas between two societies. ­A beautiful demonstration of how our two cultures and countries think alike.
A true depiction of the wisdom of our ancient civilizations.
(Meaning: All the nightingales of Iran get this fresh sweet arriving in Tehran from India)
Centuries of free exchange of ideas and traditions, poets and craftsmen, art and architecture, culture and commerce have enriched both our civilizations.
Our heritage has also been a source of strength and economic growth for our nations.
The richness of Persian heritage is an integral part of the fabric of the Indian society.
A part of Iranian culture lives in Indian hearts.
And, a slice of Indian heritage is woven into the Iranian society.
Our ancient heroes and epics bear striking parallels.
The dargahs of Azmer Sharif and Hazrat Nizamuddin in India are equally revered in Iran.
Mahabharata and Shahnama, Bhima and Rustam, Arjuna and Arsh exhibit similarity in our world views and values.
Crafts like Zardozi, Guldozi and Chanderi may be a part of the Iranian society.
They are equally common in India too.
In the richness of Iranian culture, who can forget the poetry and beauty of its vehicle—the Persian language.
In India, we regard it as one of our own.
The great medieval poets of India have called the Persian and Sanskrit the two sisters.
India’s religious epic Ramayana which has seen over a dozen translations in Persian is known to have about 250 words of Persian.
It served as a court language in medieval India.
But, its popularity is also because it is written on the hearts of the Indians.
It is taught in around 40 universities in India.
All India Radio has been running the Persian language service for last 75 years.
India has a proud collection of almost 5 million manuscripts of Persian in public and private collections.
There are more than 20 million documents in Persian in National and State Archives.
Many of these have common heritage as they were written by Iranian calligraphers and painted by Indian artists.
In Salar Jung museum in Hyderabad, such a combination can be found in many manuscripts.
A major effort to digitize all manuscripts, including Persian is currently underway in India.
Every year, the President of India has conferred awards on the Persian Scholars.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As two ancient civilizations, we are known for our ability to be inclusive and welcoming to foreign cultures.
Our contacts have not just refined our own cultures.
They have also contributed to the growth of moderate and tolerant societies globally.
Sufism a rich product of our ancient links, carried its message of true love, tolerance and acceptance to the entire mankind.
The spirit of Sufism is also reflected in the Indian concept of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, the World as one family.
Our historical ties may have seen their share of ups and downs.
But, throughout our partnership has remained a source of boundless strength for both of us.
Time has come for us to regain the past glory of traditional ties and links.
Time has come for us to march together.
In this endeavour, you, the eminent scholars have a defining role to play.
It is indeed my great pleasure to inaugurate the Conference “India and Iran, Two Great Civilizations: Retrospect and Prospects.”
In extending my best wishes for the success of your conference, I would also keenly look to receive the ideas that emerge out of your discussions.
I am happy to see that ICCR and Farhangistan have worked closely to organize this Conference.
Your deliberations indeed provide a body of strength to our literary, academic and people to people ties.
Let me thank you all once again for inviting me.
I wish all you and the conference only the very best.
I remember an insightful discussion with Naresh Ji, who as USA ambassador invited me for dinner.
He believed in strong India-USA friendship.” the Prime Minister said.
The Citation mentions initiatives such as Make in India, Startup India, Digital India, and Swachh Bharat, “which have positioned India as one of the most lucrative manufacturing and business destinations in the world.”

Ladies and Gentlemen, Greetings on the occasion of International Yoga Day!
This morning, I was delighted to join thousands of people from different walks of life, to celebrate this occasion, in the beautiful city of Dehradun, in the foot-hills of the Himalayas.
For the last few days, I have been seeing pictures of people participating in the celebrations, across the world.
Indeed, in just three years, this event has grown into a world-wide public movement.
It has become an integral part of public life in many countries.
Its impact has expanded far beyond its day of observance.
In India, I perceive three different themes in the observation of International Day of Yoga.
I am sure, this is the case in many other countries as well.
First, it has become an occasion of initiation for millions.
Inspired by the spirit of Yoga, they commit themselves to its pursuit.
Second, it is an occasion when those, who are already introduced to Yoga, re-dedicate themselves to its pursuit.
The third theme is to spread the good word.
Thousands of individuals and institutions, who have already gained from Yoga, reach out to those that still have not.
In the process, International Day of Yoga, has even come to be celebrated as a festival, by many across the world.
The word Yoga, means ‘to unite’.
Therefore, this surge of interest in Yoga, fills me with hope.
I hope that Yoga can become a binding force for the world.
I am happy that you have chosen the International Day of Yoga, for the inauguration of this Nature Cure Centre.
I hope that this Centre shall strive to strongly integrate elements of Yoga, in all its programmes and initiatives.
Traditional Indian knowledge systems, such as Yoga and Ayurveda, help us stay healthy.
They guide us to overcome inherent weaknesses of both body and mind.
These are systems, which treat individuals with care and respect.
Their approach is neither intrusive nor abrupt.
It often comes as a refreshing change to those used to conventional treatment therapies.
Modern lifestyle takes a toll on the body as well as the mind.
But it is also a fact that there are gap areas that remain un-addressed.
Healthcare specialists all over the world now appreciate the fact that systems like Yoga and Ayurveda can complement the conventional medicine system extremely well.
These holistic systems focus on wellness and disease prevention.
Adoption of these holistic practices leads to increased health and wellness in individuals and in communities.
Contrary to the perception of some people, Yoga is not limited to exercises and postures .
It involves a deep search into mind, body and spirit.
It leads to a greater understanding of one-self.
This leads further to social discipline, and in turn to ethics and enduring values of life.
Yoga is a deep philosophy that can help us to walk on the path of salvation or freedom from worries.
It contains practical steps which can benefit everyone, even those who do not consider themselves religious.
Experts of Yoga see its daily practice as beneficial in itself, leading to improved health, emotional well-being, mental clarity and joy in living.
The belief that certain yogic postures and Pranayama help to control many diseases has been widely held in India for centuries.
Now, modern science has stepped in to generate supporting evidence for this.
Science has also demonstrated that through Yoga, it is possible to exercise control over the functions of many organs in the body including heart, brain, and endocrine glands.
Today, interest in Yoga is growing rapidly in Western countries.
It would be no exaggeration to say that Yoga has been appreciated a lot by the Western world.
Several modern medical institutes of USA and Europe have adopted Yoga as an alternative or adjunct treatment for many disorders.
Of late, a lot of research has been undertaken in Yoga.
The Government of India is committed to implement evidence based traditional systems of healthcare in public health.
We have also launched nation-wide programmes for the prevention and control of non communicable diseases.
India is a big country with the world’s second largest population.
It is also significant that their objective is life-long wellness.
I assume that respect for authenticity and faith in scientific approach are inherent to these objectives.
With such an approach, the Centre can contribute significantly to the wellness movement, and take the benefits of Yoga to a large number of people in the USA.
It also gives me happiness to learn that your Centre will create five hundred direct and fifteen hundred indirect jobs in the area.
It will thus be a responsible member of the community.
I wish you all the very best for this venture.

They have set up a Barefoot women vocational training college in Zanzibar Islands of Tanzania and other countries in Africa for imparting solar electrification skills (training) and distributing solar kits to trainees.
These colleges also support various entrepreneurial skills such as bee-keeping, tailoring, etc.
The solar mamas have fabricated and installed solar kits, and now maintain these solar electrification systems in their communities.
It may be recalled that effective from midnight of 14th November, 2017 the GST rate has been slashed from 28% to 18% on goods falling under 178 headings.
There are now only 50 items which attract the GST rate of 28%.
Likewise, a large number of items have witnessed a reduction in GST rates from 18% to 12% and so on and some goods have been completely exempt from GST.
Affected consumers who feel the benefit of commensurate reduction in prices is not being passed on when they purchase any goods or services may apply for relief to the Screening Committee in the particular State.
However, in case the incident of profiteering relates to an item of mass impact with ‘All India’ ramification, the application may be directly made to the Standing Committee.
If the undue benefit cannot be passed on to the recipient, it can be ordered to be deposited in the Consumer Welfare Fund.
In extreme cases, the NAA can impose a penalty on the defaulting business entity and even order the cancellation of its registration under GST.
The constitution of the NAA shall bolster confidence of consumers as they reap the benefits of the recent reduction in GST rates, in particular, and of GST, in general.
The MoU will result in active cooperation and exchanges between the private entities, capacity building institutions, Governments and other public organisations of the two countries in the field of ICT.
The Prime Minister also saluted Sir CV Raman for his contribution to the science.
“On National Science Day, my greetings and best wishes to our scientific community.

He will also launch the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre For Socio-Economic Transformation (DAICSET).
“At 11 AM tomorrow, I will inaugurate the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre at 15 Janpath, Delhi.
This occasion is even more special as I had the opportunity to lay the foundation stone for this centre.
In the heart of our national capital, it is a fitting tribute to Dr. Ambedkar.
The Dr. Ambedkar International Centre is a fusion of Buddhist and present day architecture.
It includes seminar as well as conference halls.
Your Excellency Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha Ladies and Gentlemen
It is a great pleasure to welcome you to India.
Your visit is a high point in our top-level political exchanges.
You come from a land that is very familiar to us.
Today, Prime Minister and I reviewed the full range of our bilateral engagement:
From culture to commerce;
From closer contacts between our peoples to deeper connectivity; and
From counter-terrorism to defence and security.
We are both aware that rapid spread of terrorism and radical ideology poses a common challenge to both our societies.
And, we also recognize that our close security partnership would help us to secure our peoples from these threats.
In our shared objective to combat these challenges, India is particularly grateful to Thailand for its assistance and cooperation.
Beyond terrorism, we have agreed to further deepen our security engagement in the fields of cyber security, narcotics, transnational economic offenses and human trafficking.
The land frontiers of our two countries are not far apart.
And, we are also maritime neighbours.
So, Prime Minister and I have agreed to forge a closer partnership in the fields of defence and maritime cooperation.
A partnership to meet our bilateral interests ; and to respond to our shared regional goals.
Greater staff exchanges and more exercises;
Building linkages in the field of defence R&D and production.
Trade and commerce flows are an important lifeline of the interdependent world today.
Excellency and I agree that a more diversified commercial engagement between us would not only benefit both our economies.
It would also enable greater regional economic prosperity.
In this context, we welcome the first meeting of the India-Thailand Joint Business Forum to be held later today.
We encourage them, and the other business-sector stakeholders, to take lead in tapping the emerging business opportunities in both our countries.
Alongside trade, there are also ample avenues for greater manufacturing and investment linkages.
We see a particular synergy between Thai strengths in infrastructure, particularly tourism infrastructure, and India’s priorities in this field.
Information Technology, pharmaceuticals, auto-components, and machinery are some other areas of promising collaboration.
We also see early conclusion of a balanced Comprehensive Economic and Partnership Agreement as our shared priority.
Prime Minister and I are fully aware that smooth flow of goods, services, capital and human resources between our economies needs a strong network of air, land and sea links.
Connectivity is also an area of priority for India’s development.
Improving access to Southeast Asia from our Northeastern States benefits both our peoples.
Stronger connectivity is essential not just for expanding bilateral trade ties.
It also brings our people closer and facilitates enhanced science, education, culture and tourism cooperation.
Next year, to commemorate the seventy years of establishment of our diplomatic relations, we will celebrate Festival of India in Thailand, and Festival of Thailand in India.
This year, India is also celebrating one hundred and twenty-fifth birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of Indian Constitution.
I am delighted that the Indian Constitution will soon be translated into Thai language.
I am also happy to announce that to welcome more tourists from Thailand to India, and to help them enjoy their visits to Buddhist sites in India, we will soon facilitate double entry e-tourist visas for citizens of Thailand.
India has always deeply appreciated the warmth and affection of the Royal Family of Thailand for India.
Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn has been a frequent and very welcome visitor to India.
We look forward to welcoming her in India again later this year.
We also look forward to the honour of receiving His Royal Highness Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn in India at his earliest convenience.
In conclusion, let me say that the convergence of Thailand’s ‘Look West’, and India’s ‘Act East’ policy lights the path to a bright future of our partnership.
Excellency, let me once again welcome you and your delegation to India.
Nyari Ki Baat Nyari, Aji Kare Razi (Nyari is unique and Aji can make you to agree).
When I took over as the chief minister of Gujarat in 2001, shortly thereafter I got a call from Rajkot that Aji Dam had become full and you must visit here.
I still remember, those were the initial days after assuming the office of Chief minister and I was out to survey the situation of earthquake hit Kutch.
I got the news in about 10-15 days that the Aji Dam had become full to the brim and the people of Rajkot were so happy that I was told that I must visit there.
I was lucky to offer Jal Puja on that special day.
There is hardly any need to explain the importance of water to the people of Saurashtra and Kutch in Gujarat.
Earlier, when I used to visit Rajkot I used to find a small tank just outside every house hold with which was fitted a tap.
People used to get down and fetch water from that tank.
The Railway tankers carrying water to Rajkot used to become headlines in newspapers across the country.
We have seen those difficult days and governments generally increasing the number of tankers to supply more water.
The people became used to it.
No problem, we will manage when the next week a tanker would come.
Some areas used to demand installation of hand pumps and it was considered a big thing if the demand was fulfilled.
From there where has Gujarat now come to!
Brothers and sisters, if there is a government with foresight; if it is dedicated to the well-being of the public; if it has the intention of changing the lives of the common man we can guess what kind of good results can be produced.
The today’s youth of Gujarat who are in the age group of 15-17 and the generations to come after them would not know what was the situation in Gujarat earlier?
People were desperate for electricity.
When the electricity would be available?
Whether electricity would be available during the dinner time or not?
There is no reason to forget those days.
So, take it if you want to or leave it.
The owner of 50 Bigha land couldn’t get a loan of Rs 50,000 by mortgaging his land for daughter’s marriage.
And it was not long time ago, this was the reality of Gujarat twenty years ago.
I don’t want to dwell who was responsible for this.
However, since the time the people of Gujarat gave us the opportunity to serve them, be it the leadership of Keshubhai Patel or of Anandiben Patel or of Vijay Bhai Rupani or when I had the opportunity to serve you as your servant; during this entire period, we moved from heaven to earth to give water to the people of Gujarat , to give them electricity, to lay roads to the villages.
And that is why we can look into your eyes, we can talk to you with a sense of satisfaction.
I still remember that so many questions were raised.
It is not doable and Modi is talking about this as elections are round the corner.
People in the government naturally don’t miss any opportunity but news papers also raised the questions that it was not doable.
How such a massive fund will be arranged, how so many pipelines will be laid?
And nothing will take place till 2040.
An atmosphere of doubt was created and at that time I had assured the people of Gujarat with full confidence that this project would be executed, it would be executed within the stipulated time and we would work very hard to provide the water, we had taken that vow.
And we have taken the water to Narmada dam, at a height equivalent to that of a 65 story building.
This science has its own uniqueness.
Water could only be supplied to your homes when we took the water at a height equivalent to the height of a 65 story building.
Brothers and sisters, it requires money.
It is public money and must be used for public welfare but it ought not be wasted, it must be well spent.
This entire scheme is a good example of money being well spent.
And the work of Sardar Sarovar Dam was finished just 10 days ago.
Chief Minister and his colleagues closed the doors of the dam.
The work of doors was completed during the tenure of Anandiben, even then hurdles remained there.
Who were the trouble makers it will be known to everyone when the history of Narmada will be written.
There were so many people those were indifferent, who were indifferent to snatch away the right of Gujarat, those who did immoral things and kept our people under misery.
Brothers and sisters, water is available now but it also brings responsibilities with it.
And I’d like to request to the people of Rajkot and Saurashtra that we should not forget how we came out of those difficulties.
And now it is not just water, it has Midas touch, it’s going to bring prosperity.
We must save water.
Some of you may have gone to Mahudi to offer your respect.
Ninety years ago this great soul had predicted that water will be sold in shops.
And now we have enough water for drinking when Rakjot is moving in the direction to become smart city.
At this time an important task of managing waste water is before Rajkot.
And that is why it will not be difficult for us to have quality drinking water.
If Rajkot is developed then Aji and Nyari won’t let us thirst for water, this is the work that we have done.
Therefore, brothers and sisters, and specially to farmers, the farmers of Saurashtra, Kachcha and Gujarat, I’d like to express my sincere gratitude to the farmers of Kachcha as they followed me wholly when I urged them as chief minister of Gujarat to use drip irrigation.
Brothers and sisters, now it’s not a big deal for science to provide drip irrigation facility to every field, to provide sprinklers for irrigation to produce more crop by using less water.
The engineering industry in Rajkot is capable of producing these tools for farmers, they should demonstrate this skill and they should emerge as a trend setter not only for Gujarat and India but also for the developed countries of the world.
Brothers and sisters, I’m happy as today these young students got the opportunity to meet me.
For some people hackathon is a new word, but it’s important to properly understand this thing.
Generally, the government officers, the bureaucrats who have been working with government for years have developed a feeling that we know everything.
The God has gifted us all the wisdom.
They have a feeling that they know solutions for every problem.
This was common in the past.
However, I have changed this perception.
Sometime back I asked the departments of government of India to prepare a list of the tasks that are difficult to execute, tasks which require more efforts, more time and more money.
However, I relentlessly pursued this matter with them.
They identified 500 issues where they felt the need to rethink.
I organized a hakathon.
What should the municipal corporation of Rajkot do to make it a smart city?
How to increase people’s participation?
How to solve the traffic problems, how to develop a system for payment of taxes?
What should be done to bring about the changes in poor people’s lives?
Thousands of youth are eager to participate in this hackothon beginning on 29 July.
How to change the face of Rajkot, how to modernize the system of Rajkot, this is going to be done by our college going young generation.
I salute their energy and enthusiasm.
I have full confidence in this thing.
Brothers and sisters, who will not be happy today after having seen the water in Aji Dam?
With the feeling of that joy, how much happiness will we feel if we see a green Saurasthra, keeping that thing in the mind I once again express my gratitude to the state government that the Sauni Scheme that was born under the clouds of suspicion has today turned out to be very successful.
With these good wishes I express my gratitude to all of you.
The Prime Minister regretted that it had become a fashion to politicize every decision taken by the Union Government for the progress of the country.
With the changing geo-political environment, the crude oil import policy needs to be modified to bring it in tune with current needs.
The Minister conveyed to Prime Minister Modi, greetings from President Sisi of Egypt.

I would also like to thank you for the excellent arrangements and for the warmth of your welcome.
The visit to the beautiful heritage city of Vientiane reminds me of deep historical and cultural links that the city shares with India.
I also commend Vietnam for its able leadership of ASEAN-India relations as the Country Coordinator.
Our engagement with ASEAN is not just about a solid base of shared civilizational heritage.
It is also driven by our common strategic priorities of securing our societies and bringing peace, stability and prosperity to the region.
ASEAN is central to India’s ‘Act East’ Policy.
And, our ties are a source of balance and harmony in the region.
We have already implemented 54 out of 130 activities identified in the Plan of Action.
In face of growing traditional and non-traditional challenges, politico-security cooperation is a key emerging pillar of our relationship.
Rising export of terror, growing radicalization through ideology of hatred, and spread of extreme violence define the landscape of common security threats to our societies.
The threat is local, regional and transnational at the same time.
Our partnership with ASEAN seeks to craft a response that relies on coordination, cooperation and sharing of experiences at multiple levels.
Next year will be a historic milestone in our ties.
We will celebrate 25 years of our Dialogue Partnership, 15 years of our Summit Level interaction and 5 years of our Strategic Partnership.
A host of other events – a Business Summit; CEOs Forum; a car rally and sailing expedition; and cultural festivals are also planned.

The Election Commission has been participating in promoting cooperation in the field of election matters and electoral processes across the world with certain foreign countries and agencies by adopting the mode of MoU signed by the concerned parties.
The Election Commission, a constitutional body, conducts the largest electoral exercise in the world.
It is the responsibility of the Election Commission to organize free and fair election in the country of about 85 crore voters with diverse socio-political and economic backgrounds.
In recently years, the role being played by the Election Commission ensures greater participation of people in political affairs.
India, today, is considered as the world’s largest democratic country.
The success of democracy in India has attracted the attention of almost every political system around the world.
Both sides had reaffirmed their resolve to further develop their strong strategic partnership.
They also discussed enhanced cooperation, regionally and globally, in pursuing shared priorities for peace, stability and combating terrorism.
Prime Minister appreciated the close engagement between the two countries on regional and global issues of mutual concern.

My Ministerial Colleagues Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Shri Manoj Sinha
As we celebrate this important occasion today, we recall our ancient ethos of universal brotherhood.
This has been expressed in the famous Sanskrit phrase– VasudhaivaKutumbakam – the world is one family.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
India is the fastest growing economy in the world today.
We are committed to raising the standards of living of our people.
In this direction, we have given forty million new cooking gas connections in the last two years.
It has also eliminated their dependence on firewood.
Besides saving electricity, this has also prevented huge additional amounts of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere.
We have targeted generation of one hundred and seventy-five GigaWatts of solar and wind energy by 2022.
We will reduce the emissions intensity of India’s GDP by twenty to twenty-five percent over 2005 levels by 2020.
We have a robust National Biodiversity Strategy.
With only two point four percent of the world’s land area, India supports seven to eight percent of the recorded species diversity.
At the same time, India supports nearly eighteen percent of human population.
The population of tiger, elephant, lion rhino and other forms of wildlife is on the rise.
We also recognize the need to tackle the issue of water availability, which is becoming a major challenge in India.
We have launched the massive Namami Gange initiative.
This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.
India is primarily an agrarian country.
The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water.
We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients instead of burning them.
While much of the world focuses on Inconvenient Truth, we have moved on to Convenient Action.
It was this call for Convenient Action that led India, along with France, to form the International Solar Alliance.
This is perhaps, the single most important global development, towards the cause of environment, after the Paris Conference.
About three months ago, leaders from over 45 nations, and Heads of International Organizations, gathered here in New Delhi, for the Founding Conference of the International Solar Alliance.
Our experience shows that development can be environment friendly.
It need not come at the cost of our green assets.
A lot of it never makes it to the recycling bin.
Worse, a lot of it is non-bio-degradable.
Plastic pollution is already having a deadly impact on our marine ecosystem.
Scientists and fishermen alike have pointed to signs of trouble.
These include declining fish catches, warming ocean temperatures, and vanishing habitats.
Marine litter especially micro-plastic, is a major trans-boundary problem.
India is preparing to join the “Clean Seas Campaign” and make its contribution towards saving our oceans.
Our national mission on cleanliness and sanitation – Swachh Bharat Abhiyan – has a special focus on “plastic waste management.”
A short while ago, I visited the Exhibition set up by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.
It showcases some of our success stories.
Among its participants are United Nations, Union and State Governments, industry, and non-government organizations.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable, the most.
It is the duty of each one of us, to ensure that the quest for material prosperity does not compromise our environment.
As part of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the world had agreed to the theme of “Leave No One Behind.”
This is not possible without ensuring that we all come together to protect what Mother Nature has given us.
This is the Indian way.
And we are happy to share it again with the international community on the auspicious occasion of World Environment Day.
In conclusion, as global host of World Environment Day 2018, I reiterate our commitment to sustainable development.
Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live.
The choices may not be easy.
But through awareness, technology, and a genuine global partnership, I am sure we can make the right choices.

Following is the preliminary draft of English rendering of PM’s statement on terror attack in Pulwama based on the extracts from his speech on this occasion.
“At the outset, my tributes to the soldiers martyred in the terror attack in Pulwama.
I know there is deep anger, your blood boils looking at what has happened.
I am hopeful that the patriotic fervour will ensure that people will provide correct information to our agencies so that we can intensify our efforts to crush terror.
Let me assure the nation that those behind this attack, the perpetrators of this attack will be punished.
I also understand the sentiments of those who are criticising us.
They have full rights.
However, it is my request to all my friends that it is a very sensitive and emotional moment and the nation stands united in its fight against terror.
We should speak in one voice and rise above politics.The message which should go across the world is that we are one nation, one voice in our fight against terror, the fight which we have to win.
Times and again it has been proved that those which follow such routes are destroyed themselves.
The course which we have adopted is one of progress and development.
Many big countries have strongly condemned this terror attack, have stood behind India and expressed support for India.
Friends, after Pulwama terror attack, we are in a state of grief as well as deep anger.
However, let me tell you, nation will counter such attacks strongly.India will not be intimidated.
I salute our martyrs, seek their blessings and assure you that we will leave no stone unturned to fulfil their dreams for which they have laid down their lives for the nation.
We will strive hard to gather momentum on the road to development as a mark of our respect to the martyrs.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired a roundtable meeting on renewable energy, with top energy CEOs and experts, in San Jose.
A related thought was that the current grid is not designed for carrying the 175 GigaWatts (GW) of renewable energy that India is targeting, and therefore a complimentary effort is required on the grid side.
In addition to solar and wind energy, biomass was also suggested as a key provider of clean energy.

Though we are celebrating 25 years of our partnership, our shared voyage goes back thousands of years.
It is a privilege for India to host all the ASEAN Leaders for the second time in five years.
Tomorrow, you will be our honoured Guests at our Republic Day celebrations.
The presence of my brothers and sisters from all our ASEAN partners at this joyous celebration is unprecedented.
Your collective presence here has also touched the hearts of my 1.25 billion fellow Indians.
It highlights the importance of our Strategic Partnership, placing ASEAN at the centre of India’s Act East Policy.
Our friendship has been nurtured by our shared cultural and civilizational linkages.
The Ramayana, the ancient Indian epic, continues to be a valuable shared legacy in ASEAN and the Indian subcontinent.
We have organised a Ramayana Festival with troupes from ASEAN countries, to showcase our common cultural treasure through this great epic.
Other major religions, including Buddhism, also bind us closely.
Islam, in many parts of South East Asia has distinctive Indian connections going back several centuries.
We have made excellent progress in implementing the objectives of the ASEAN-India Partnership for Peace, Progress and Shared Prosperity, through five year plans of action.
The progress in implementing our third Action Plan for the period 2016-2020 is commendable.
Capacity building projects have been undertaken through the ASEAN-India Cooperation Fund, the ASEAN-India Green Fund, and ASEAN-India Science and Technology Fund.
We remain committed to work with ASEAN to enhance practical cooperation and collaboration in our shared maritime domain.
During the Retreat Session, we had an opportunity to discuss ASEAN-India cooperation in maritime domain, as one of the key focus areas for growth and development of the Indo-Pacific region.
Indeed, Maritime cooperation has been an integral part of our discourse throughout our commemorative activities, with the theme resonating in the ASEAN India Connectivity Summit, in the Workshop on Blue Economy, as well as in regular dialogue mechanisms.
Humanitarian and Disaster Relief efforts, Security cooperation, and Freedom of Navigation will be key focus areas for our Maritime cooperation.
The Connectivity Summit was also an affirmation of the linkages that India shares with ASEAN through land, air, maritime, cultural, civilizational and people-to-people relations that date back centuries.
These could include new areas of cooperation in a regional high-capacity fiber optic network, and a national rural broadband networks to digitally connect remote areas.
India offers to undertake a pilot project on rural connectivity, which would create digital villages in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam.
Success of this project could be replicated in other ASEAN countries.
We also offer a training programme on Telecom and Networking Technologies, to share best practices in Policy, Regulation and Technological Development for Information and Communication Technology professionals from ASEAN countries.
In order to deepen our understanding and cooperation in financial matters, I propose a dialogue on digital financial inclusion and investment promotion and infrastructure.
Combating terror financing jointly is yet another important area where we could work collectively.
Investments from ASEAN and India are robust and growing.
We will continue to work with ASEAN to further enhance our trade ties, and facilitate interactions among our business community.
The Indian Diaspora has settled far and wide in Southeast Asia.
They are warmly accepted in the local community.
Earlier this month, the ASEAN-India Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Singapore recognised their contribution in forging closer ties between us.
Held at the same time in New Delhi, in the first Conference of Members of Parliament and Mayors with Indian heritage, there was a large representation from ASEAN countries.
To build on our historical bonds, I propose that we declare 2019 as the ASEAN-India Year of Tourism.
We could set up tangible and intangible cultural heritage circuits to further promote tourism.
It was a privilege for India to play a role in conservation works of temples in Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Vietnam.
A virtual knowledge portal of ASEAN India network of Museums could curate this shared heritage.
An important focus of our commemorative events celebrates the power of our youth, our future.
The Youth Summit, the Artist Residency, the Music Festival, and the Start Up Festival for digital commerce among our youth were intended for this.
We have given a boost to their spirit by giving Youth Awards on 24th January.
To further empower our youth in our region, I have the pleasure to announce 1000 Fellowships to students and researchers from ASEAN countries for studying integrated PhD programmes in Indian Institutes of Technology, India’s premier institutions of imparting knowledge.
We would also like to offer dedicated training courses at the Indian Academy of Highway Engineers for ASEAN Highway Professionals.
I now invite Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore, His Excellency Lee Hsein Loong to please deliver the Opening Remarks in Singapore’s capacity as the ASEAN Chair for 2018 and the Co-Chair for this Plenary Session.
यदिदी ह्येकार (my good friend) Prime Minister Netanyahu
Friends from the Media, I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mrs. Sara Netanyahu for opening their home to me today.
I am most grateful for their warm and generous hospitality.
Just a short while back, I laid a wreath at the Yad Vashem Memorial museum to remember and honour over six million Jewish lives that were lost in the horror of the holocaust.
Yad Vashem is a reminder of the unspeakable evil inflicted generations ago.
As such, we must resolutely oppose the evils of terrorism, radicalism and violence that plague our time.
The link between our people goes back to thousands of years when the first Jews landed on India’s south-western coastline.
Since then, the Jews have flourished, and their traditions and practices thrived in India.
My visit to Israel celebrates this ancient bond between communities across both our nations.
And, I am happy that I will have occasion to engage with the rich Indian diaspora in Israel later tomorrow.
In modern times, our ties have seen rapid growth since the establishment of our full diplomatic relations a quarter century ago.
Common objectives of economic prosperity, strong technology and innovation ties and the need to secure our societies define the space for convergent action between us.
Over coming decades, we want to frame a relationship that transforms the landscape of our economic engagement.
India is the world’s fastest growing large economy.
Our focus on using technology and innovation to meet our development priorities provides productive scope to expand our academic, scientific & research, and business links.
We also want to put in place a robust security partnership to respond to shared threats to our peace, stability and prosperity.
I will work with Prime Minister Netenyahu to craft and build a clear action agenda to realise these objectives.
PM addresses the 80th anniversary celebrations of the Brahma Kumaris family via video conferencing
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the 80th anniversary celebrations of the Brahma Kumaris family, via video conferencing.
Welcoming the delegates to the International Conference and Cultural Festival from India and abroad, the Prime Minister paid his respects to Dada Lekhraj, the founder of Prajapita Brahmakumari Ishvariya Vishvidyalaya.

It will help in streamlining the procedure of return of nationals who are caught to be staying illegally, belonging to the other party in a specified time-frame.
The Prime Minister mentioned that India attached great significance to further strengthening her relations with Qatar, which is our close friend and with which we share an extended neighbourhood.
After his address from the Red Fort tomorrow morning, the Prime Minister will go to Sarangpur, Gujarat to pay his last respects to HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj.
“HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj, a stalwart among humans who embodied compassion & humility.
His service to society will always be remembered.
HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj was a mentor to me.
I will never forget my interactions with him.
Will miss his presence” , the Prime Minister said.
1. Measures to mainstream SDGs into on-going national policies, programmes and strategic action plans to address the developmental challenges.
4. High Level Steering Committee will review the National Indicator Framework on regular basis for its improvement.
1. SDGs integrate economic, social and environmental dimensions of development.
It intends eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world with basic motto of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikash’.
2. SDGs with 17 Goals and 169 Targets intend for promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.
The UN General Assembly in its 70thSession considered and adopted the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) for the next 15 years.
Implementation and success will rely on countries’ own sustainable development policies, plans and programmes.
Countries would be responsible for follow-up and review at the national level, with regard to the progress made in implementing the Goals and targets.
Actions at the national level to monitor progress under SDGs will require quality, accessible and timely data.
The festival has been organized by the Art of Living Foundation, to commemorate 35 years of the organization’s service to mankind.

I am very happy to be here for the North Eastern Council Plenary meeting.
I also take this opportunity of welcoming you all to this meeting.
I hope that the deliberations that have already taken place since yesterday and further deliberations that we have today, will help in faster development of this region.
I am also happy to note that the North Eastern Council has provided support in the development of the North East region.
It has been instrumental in establishment of a number of institutions and taking up infrastructure projects in the region.
To meet the growing aspirations of the people, it is important that the North Eastern Council introspects and assesses the extent to which it has been able to achieve its objectives.
Perhaps, there is a need to re-orient and upgrade the North Eastern Council.
You may like to consider developing the North Eastern Council as a state-of-the-art resource centre for the North Eastern states with the necessary resources, knowledge and skills.
The resource centre may enable the states and the implementing agencies to properly plan and execute projects, promote research and innovations and provide strategic policy vision for the region.
The North Eastern Council may look into developing a specialised domain expertise either by itself or through an agency model to assist states and central ministries in their development planning as also problem solving needs.
This will enable the imbibing of good governance and best practices in the region.
The North Eastern Council should also consider focussing on issues in emerging areas of livelihood, entrepreneurship, venture funds, start-ups and skill development.
All this will help in generating jobs.
The government has been focussing on the development of the North East region through its pro-active “Act East Policy”.
As part of this policy, we are focussing on reducing the isolation of the region by improving all round connectivity through road, rail, telecom, power and waterways sectors.
If the western region of the country can develop, if other regions of the country can develop, I see no reason why the North East region of the country cannot develop.
I am also convinced that India can move forward if all the regions develop including the North East region.
The North East region is also very important to us for strategic reasons.
And it is my conviction that we have to bring this region at par with the other developed regions of the country.
In the current Budget, more than Rs.30,000 crores have been earmarked for the North East region.
It should be our endeavour to ensure that this money is spent well for the development of the region.
We believe in cooperative and competitive federalism.
States that are strong and want to grow further, need to be given adequate authority and resources.
And States that are not so strong, need to be given needful assistance.
It is in this regard that based on the report of the Committee of Chief Ministers, we have decided to continue to provide assistance in the ratio of 90:10 for core Central schemes and 80:20 for non-core schemes to the North Eastern States.
In the recent past, we have established two important projects in Assam – Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited and Numaligarh Refinery Limited’s wax unit.
These are big projects that would create huge employment opportunities in the North East region.
However, it has taken us many years to complete these projects.
We have to ensure that we are able to complete our projects in time and without cost over-runs.
Only then can we realise the true benefits of these projects.
The North East is the gateway to South East Asia and we need to take advantage of this.
This should give a boost to the economic development of the region.
We have created a specialised highways construction agency for the North East – the “National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation” – that was incorporated on 18th July 2014.
Since then it has set up its Branch Offices, one each in every North Eastern State.
In the road sector, we need to keep in view the special land and weather conditions of this area.
The Government is also making a heavy investment in power transmission projects covering all the eight North Eastern states at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore.
This would ensure power to more areas.
The recent commissioning of Bishwanath-Chariyali-Agra transmission line has also brought 500 MegaWatt additional capacity to the region.
The railways have undertaken a major expansion in the region at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore.
In November 2014, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya were put up on the rail map.
Agartala in Tripura has also been connected with broad gauge line.
We are on the way to ensure that all the North East states come on the rail map soon.
In the North East, the Indian Railways has commissioned about 900 kilometres of Broad Gauge in the last two years, leaving only about 50 kilometres Meter Gauge lines to be converted in 2016-17.
In addition, a 132 kilometre part of third alternative connectivity route to North East (that is New Maynaguri – Jogighopa) has also been commissioned.
There are a number of strengths of the North East which we need to harness for healthy growth of the region.
All the states of the North East region are blessed with natural scenic beauty, distinct historical cultural and ethnic heritage.
All this offers tremendous scope for tourism in the region.
There is also a great scope for mountaineering, trekking and adventure tourism in the region.
If developed and promoted well, this can emerge as the biggest employer in the region.
It can also add to the growth and income of the region.
I understand that the Ministry of Tourism has identified a thematic circuit for the North East region.
I hope that the North Eastern states will make the best use of the scheme to develop tourist circuits and attract tourists from all over the world.
The region can also look into combining a few popular destinations of the neighbouring countries with their tourism circuits.
The Government has approved North East BPO promotion scheme in the Digital India programme for creation of employment opportunities.
The North East States must avail facilities and get these BPOs operationalized in their respective States.
This will promote growth and provide jobs to our youth.
If we focus our development strategy on organic farming, it would help the region greatly.
A few months ago, I was in Sikkim and participated in a function to declare Sikkim as the first organic state in the country.
The North East can become the organic food basket for this country.
Organic products are going to be increasingly used widely and if the North East Council can assist the states in the region to take a lead in this area, it will contribute immensely to the income of the people and the region.
There is a large rural population in the North East region.
If we talk of Assam alone, 86% of the population lives in rural areas.
We have initiated the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Mission to bring in economic, social and basic development of the rural areas in a cluster model.
It should be the endeavour of the region’s states to make use of this mission for the development of the rural areas.
In the end, I would like to express my gratitude to the chairman and all the members of the North Eastern Council for successfully conducting the plenary meeting in Shillong.
My special thanks to the Governor and the Chief Minister of Meghalaya for hosting this meeting.
I am sure that the deliberations in this meeting will go a long way in providing direction to the development of the region.
The Joint Working Group on Urban Development is expected to meet once in a year, alternately in UK and in India.
The MoU will promote strong, deep and long term bilateral cooperation in the field of Sustainable Urban Development between the two countries.
Beneficiaries
He said that today, he has the opportunity to simultaneously speak to two sentinels of New India – farmers and scientists.
He said that today, there is record production of foodgrains, pulses, fruits and vegetables, and milk.
He said several Model Acts related to farmers’ welfare have been prepared, and States have been urged to implement them.
He said that for this purpose the cost will include elements such as labour, rent for machinery, cost of seeds and fertilizers, revenue being given to State Government, interest on working capital, and rent of leased land.
The Prime Minister said comprehensive steps are being taken for Agriculture Marketing Reforms.
It is important to connect Rural Retail Markets with wholesale and global markets.
He said that in the recent Union Budget, Grameen Retail Agriculture Markets have been envisaged.
22,000 rural haats will be upgraded with necessary infrastructure, and integrated with APMC and the e-NAM platform.
He said Farmer Producer Organizations, would be given relief on income tax, on the lines of cooperative societies.
He said a new chapter in Agriculture Marketing Reform is being added in this programme, with the e-marketing portal for organic products.
He said that along with the Green Revolution and White Revolution, we must stress on Organic Revolution, Water Revolution, Blue Revolution, and Sweet Revolution.
The Prime Minister explained how honey-bees could be an important source of additional income for farmers.
Similarly, he spoke of the benefits of solar farming.
He said about 2.75 lakh solar pumps have reached farmers in the last three years.
The Prime Minister said that such events should also be held in far-flung areas.
On this day, a youngster aged 18 years, Khudiram Bose, was sent to the gallows.
It tells us about the struggle for independence and the sacrifices and reminds us of our responsibility towards the nation.
Respectable Shri Venkaiah Naidu has become the first Vice President of the country, who was born in independent India.
I think maybe he is the only Vice President who has been associated with this environment for so many years and knows the nuances of the House.
The Country has got a Vice President who is familiar with everybody and everything – from the members to the committees, to the proceedings of the House.
His public life started with the JP movement.
And today we all have elected him and handed him over the responsibility for this position.
Venkaiah ji is the son of a farmer.
I have had the privilege of working with him for many years.
Be it for a village, for the poor, or for the farmers, he had been providing his inputs all the time while studying these topics very closely.
He was the Urban Development Minister in the Cabinet too.
But I always felt that during the discussions in the cabinet he used to talk more about farmers and the problems of rural areas than the subjects related to urban areas.
This topic was close to his heart probably because of his family background and childhood which was associated with villages.
As Venkaiah ji has taken over the office of the Vice President, it is our responsibility to familiarize the whole world with it.
There are also responsibilities which should be viewed in isolation from the politics.
India’s democracy is very mature.
Indian constitution is very powerful.
Thus, I can clearly see the inheritance that our forefathers have given us.
Once again I would like to bow down those constitution makers.
Venkaiah ji is a great personality with austerity and great oratory skills.
He possesses these rich endowments in his personality and we are familiar with his debating skills.
And sometimes when he makes speeches in Telugu, it seems that he is running super-fast.
But when one expresses his ideas with conviction which are based on a vision and beliefs, then the person touches the heart of the people.
And Venkaiah ji has always been successful in this regard.
It is also true that there is no such MP today, who doesn’t appeal to the government for the development of rural areas day in and day out – be it the Government of Dr. Manmohan Singh ji or mine.
One such demand is for the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana in their respective areas.
It is a matter of pride for all the MPs that the idea of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana was envisaged by our very Vice-President, the Venerable Venkaiah Ji.
This can only happen when one can empathise with the poor, the farmer, and the oppressed and is determined to take them out of their problems.
I believe that a person like him who has come from within the system and has been in the Rajya Sabha for so many years shall show us the path and guide us in the House as the Chairman of the House.
I have full faith and I believe that a positive change is to come.
And today as Venkaiah ji is accepting this dignified post, I would quote a few lines:
And I would like to add –
Heartiest congratulations and thanks a lot!
A Working Group will be set up to further elaborate the details of cooperation and to oversee the implementation.
My thoughts are with his family & supporters in this sad hour”, the Prime Minister said.
The MoU would expand more Bilateral Trade and Economic Cooperation between India and Russian Federation.
The Exercise, named Iron Fist 2016, was conducted in the presence of President Pranab Mukherjee, the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
The Air Force displayed the full range of its attack and defence capabilities.
This included net enabled operations, air defence operations, combat support operations, aerobatic displays, multifaceted operations and all-weather operations.
“Firepower of the Air Force and the skill of the Air Warriors fills our hearts with immense pride,” the Prime Minister tweeted.
He said Russia helped us when we faced war, and the Indian jawans were victorious.
He said this was a relationship of strength, but the strength was the strength of friendship.
Even in international fora, he added, Russia had always supported India.
The Prime Minister motivated Indian students studying in Russia, to encourage Russians to visit India for tourism.
He said today India is being praised globally for its economic performance.
The world was looking at India with hope, and investors were confident of investing in the country.
He said this investment would build world class infrastructure in India and also generate jobs for students.
He said the world now looked at India not just as a market, but as a potential manufacturing hub.
The Prime Minister described his visit to Russia as immensely successful, and said his talks with President Putin had been extremely successful.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, was apprised about the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between India and Bangladesh in September, 2011 on bilateral cooperation in the field of Fisheries and aquaculture and allied activities.
This MoU could be extended for further period as may be mutually agreed upon.
The NCBC was set up in pursuance to the Supreme Court judgement in the Indra Sawhney case as per the NCBC Act 1993.
Section 9 (“Functions of the Commission”) of the NCBC Act 1993 states as under:

If it’s not for today, it will never happen again; such was the mood of the people of the country.
It seemed that Rajaji’s movement was being carried out through the elite class.
Bombay showed the way.
All means of transport were stopped.
The Court proceedings were stalled.
This book provides the description of that time and shows the kind of atmosphere at that time.
We should place the country above the party.
Politics should be separated from this.
These challenges are not considered as challenges of the government but that of the country.
This is our path under Gandhi’s leadership.
Our upbringing and ideologies might be different.
Can we revive that dream?
We should think of the mothers and sisters of our country who are under this burden.
The country should bear the burden of at least a class of people which includes women and sisters of this country.
Gradually growing, slowly spreading, people were slowly connecting.
But from Nineteen Forty Two to Nineteen Forty Seven, it was not an incremental change.
There was an environment of disruption which forced the British to finish all the equations and give us freedom; to force them to go.

Slowly the world was moving; gradually the world was changing itself.
There was a sudden change in life.
And technology played a greater role.
We can feel a positive change with this disruption.
It is something unique to the world.
Mahatma Gandhi had given the slogan of ‘do or die’; that was the formula of that time.
Together we will end the problem of malnutrition from the country.

AIM has multiple programs to encourage and support innovation in the country.
State of the art Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs) are being established in thousands of schools, world class Atal Incubation Centres (AIC) and Atal Community Innovation Centers (ACIC) are being established for universities and industry,
Promotion of product development in areas of national relevance and social importance is being supported through Atal New India Challenges (ANICs).
Financial implications:
Each ATL receives a grant in aid of Rs. 12 lakhs in the first year, and upto 2 lakhs per year for subsequent 4 years, for maintenance of the ATL equipment and operational expenses.
Each selected AIC would be receiving grant in aid upto Rs 10 crore over 3-5 years in tranches per year, based on review and evidence of planned milestones reached.
Innovators will receive commercialization and technology deployment grants upto Rs. 1 crore under the ANICs.
The Mission has undertaken many bold and forward-looking initiatives such as Alal Tinkering Labs (ATL) and Atal Incubation Centres (AIC), which have received great traction;
Many Ministries/Departments of Government of India have initiated innovation related activities with the help and technical support of AIM.
Under the ATL program, more than 10,000 schools are expected to establish these labs by 2020.
More than 100 Atal Incubation Centres (AICs) are likely to established around the country, supporting at least 50-60 startups each over the first five years.
More than 100 innovators/startups are expected to receive some support for productizing their innovations.
Other programs being supported through Ministries will have even more beneficiaries.
Each incubator is expected to foster 50-60 technology driven innovative Startups every four years.
The 100+ Incubators set up would thus foster 5000-6000 innovative Startups and this will multiply with new incubators being set up.
The potential for employment generation from these innovations driven Startups is quite high.
Implementation Strategy and targets:
AIM selects each beneficiary through open, competitive, online applications, and disburses grants directly.
Furthermore, AIM leverages its experts and networks around the country to build capacity in ATLs, AICs, etc. connecting various kinds of populations.
Additionally, corporate and international partners are connected to AIM beneficiaries, to ensure flow of information and technology between academia, innovation, and the start-up ecosystem as well as provide mentoring support to ensure success of AIM’s initiatives.
101 Atal Incubation Centres have been selected nationwide, out of which 31 have received the first tranche of grants.
Twenty-four Atal New India Challenges (ANIC) have been launched and more than 800 applications have been received.
As on date, more than 2,500 mentors are actively mentoring students in over 1,300 ATL schools.
AlM’s objectives are to create and promote an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship across the country at school, university, research institutions, MSME and industry levels.

All the dignitaries present here on the dais and all my friends present in this beautiful ground, I convey my best wishes on the fourth International Day for Yoga to Yoga lovers all over the world from this holy land of Devbhumi Uttarakhand.
When divisive powers gain prominence then it leads to disintegration.
It leads to division among the people, division among the societies and division among the countries.
Societies become the links for national integration.
And this kind of countries bring about peace and harmony in the world.
And humanity flourishes and gainstrength from this feeling of brotherhood.
It means Yoga unites individuals, families, societies, countries and the world and it unites the entire humanity.
And this was the first such proposal in the history of United Nations which was approved in the least time.
If we start taking pride in our legacy and if we abandon those things which are out of sync with the time, and that kind of thing doesn’t last either.
However, what is appropriate as per the time and which is useful in making of the future, if we take pride in our great legacy of this kind then the world too will never hesitate in taking pride in that.
When parents, when family, when brothers and sisters, all of them accept a child as it is only then the neighbours also start accepting the child.
Today, Yoga has become one of the most powerful unifying forces in the world.
I can say it with full sense of confidence that today if we gather the number of people doing Yoga in the entire world then incredible facts will be revealed to the world.
Infact, Yoga Day has become one of the biggest mass movements in the quest for good health and well-being.
Friends, from Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, Yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions.
It has the best of our past and presents and a ray of hope for our future.
In Yoga, we have the perfect solution to the problems we face, either as individuals or in our society.
Ours is a world that never sleeps.
At every given point, there is something happening in a different part of the world.
A fast-paced existence brings with it lot of stress.
I was shocked to read that every year, almost 18 million people all over the world die due to heart-related diseases.
About 1.6 million people lose the fight against diabetes.
The way to lead a calm, creative and content life is Yoga.
It can show the way in defeating tensions and mindless anxiety.
Instead of dividing, Yoga always unites.
Instead of increasing suffering, Yoga heals.
Practicing Yoga has the ability to herald an era of peace, happiness and brotherhood.
More people practicing Yoga means the world needs more people to teach it.
I urge you all to build on this momentum in the times to come.
May this Yoga Day become an opportunity to deepen our connect with Yoga and motivate people around us to practice it.
This can be the enduring impact of this day.
It has revealed in the studies conducted by Coventry University and Radboud University that Yoga not only provides relief to our bodies but it can also reverse those molecular reactions taking place in our DNA that cause illness and depression.
Therefore, today, I urge you people that those who have been practicing Yoga please make it regular, and those who could not start doing Yoga so far they must make an effort once.
Friends, the increasing spread of Yoga has brought the world to India and India to the world even closer.
The position that Yoga has got in the world due to constant efforts made by us that position will be further strengthened with the time.
Please come forward, let us further intensify our efforts by keeping our responsibility in the mind.
From this holy land, I once again convey my best wishes to the Yoga enthusiast all over the world.
I convey my sincere regards to the government of Uttarakhand for organising this event.

The present sanctioned strength of the Force is 96,093 having 73 Bns (including 2 NDRF Battalions).
Earlier augmentation-cum-structuring exercises were taken in 2005, 2010 and 2011.
The speed and scale of changes we encounter today are unprecedented.
It is a deep-rooted curiosity-driven scientific tradition which allows quick adaptation to new realities.
Tomorrow’s experts will come from investments we make today in our people and infrastructure.
In the last two sessions of the science congress, I presented before you several key challenges and opportunities for the nation.
Some of these important challenges are in the key sectors of clean water & energy, food, environment, climate, security, and healthcare.
We equally need to keep an eye on the rise of disruptive technologies and be prepared to leverage them for growth.
We need to clearly assess the challenges and opportunities for our technology readiness and competitiveness.
The oceans that surround the Indian peninsula have over thirteen hundred of our islands.
They also give us a seven and a half thousand kilometre coastline and 2.4 million square kilometres of Exclusive Economic Zone.
They contain enormous opportunities in energy, food, medicine and a host of other natural resources.
The ocean economy should be a significant dimension of our sustainable future.
I am told, that the Ministry of Earth Sciences is working to launch a Deep Ocean Mission to explore, understand and harness this resource in a responsible way.
This could be a transformative step for the prosperity and security of the nation.
Our best science and technology institutions should further strengthen their basic research in line with leading global standards.
Translating this basic knowledge into innovations, start-ups and industry will help us achieve inclusive and sustainable growth.
I am sure that our scientists will further meet the challenges of enhanced quality of basic research, its technology translation and its societal connect.
The wheels we set in motion today will achieve this goal.
Science must meet the rising aspirations of our people.
India fully appreciates the strong role science and technology plays in meeting the societal needs.
We must address the problems of urban-rural divide and work for inclusive development, economic growth and employment generation.
To enable this, there is a need for a new overarching structure that will coordinate with all the relevant stakeholders.
Our ability to mount and execute large, transformational national missions requires effective partnerships that integrate with a large stakeholder base.
We should involve foreign and NRI PhD students in post-doctoral research in our projects.
Another empowering factor for scientific delivery is the Ease of Doing Science.
If we want science to deliver, we must not constrain it.
The desirability of establishing professionally managed, large regional centers in PPP mode housing high value scientific equipment should be examined.
On the lines of Corporate Social Responsibility, the concept of Scientific Social Responsibility needs to be inculcated to connect our leading institutions to all stakeholders, including schools and colleges.
We must create an environment for sharing of ideas and resources.
The brightest and best in every corner of India should have the opportunity to excel in science.
To this end, I would exhort the National Laboratories to connect with schools and colleges to develop appropriate training programs.
This will also help with the effective use and maintenance of our vast scientific and technological infrastructure.
Laboratories, Research Institutions and Universities in each major city region, should be interlinked to function on a hub and spoke model.
The hubs will share major infrastructure, drive our national science missions and be the engines that link discovery to application.
College teachers with background in research can be connected to the neighbouring universities and R&D institutions.
Seeding the power of ideas and innovation in schoolchildren will broaden the base of our innovation pyramid and secure the future of our nation.
As a step in this direction, Ministry of Science & Technology is initiating a programme focused on students of classes 6 to 10.
While we excel globally, we also need to develop local solutions that fit our unique context.
For example, we should develop a host of technologies based on efficient co-generation for clusters of villages and semi-urban areas.
Focus on environment and climate remains our priority to ensure sustainable development.
Our strong scientific community can also effectively address our unique challenges.
For example, can we find farmer-centric solutions to the problem of crop burning?
Can we redesign our brick kilns for reduced emissions and greater energy efficiency?
Two other strong initiatives are Atal Innovation Mission and NIDHI – the National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations.
These programmes focus on building an innovation driven enterprise ecosystem.
Further, Public-Private partnerships with CII, FICCI and high technology private companies are being pursued to strengthen the innovation ecosystem.
Our Scientists have contributed strongly to the strategic vision of the nation.
The Indian space programme has put India among the top space faring nations.
We have achieved a high degree of self-sufficiency in space technology, including launch vehicle development, payload and satellite building, applications for development and the building of core competence and capacity.
The Defence Research & Development Organisation has played the role of a force multiplier for the Armed Forces with its systems and technologies.
We are leveraging strategic international partnerships and collaborations based on the principles of mutuality, parity and reciprocity, to make Indian Science globally competitive.
Last year, we activated the 3.6 meter optical telescope in Devasthal in Uttarakhand made with Indo-Belgian collaboration.
Recently, we approved the LIGO project with USA to construct a state-of-the-art detector system in India.
In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the Government remains committed to provide the best support to our Scientists and Scientific Institutions.
I am sure that our scientists will scale up their efforts ranging from the quality of basic sciences to technology development to innovation.
Let Science and Technology become a strong tool of inclusive development and betterment of the weakest and poorest segments of our society.
Together, we will prevail to make a just, equitable and prosperous nation.

“In former President Shimon Peres, we lost a key world leader and a friend of India.
Our condolences to people of Israel”, the Prime Minister said.
Shriman Sakal Shastriji, you mentioned ‘Karnataka’… you beautifully maintained a delicate balance between words when you wrote ‘Ayushman Bharat’; ‘Long live India’ will be possible only when we express ‘Ayushman Bhoomi; ‘Long live the land’; and that will be conceivable only when we begin feeling concerned about every living being on this land.
And it is his heart felt desire to see all those photos & videos being shared on social media.
Now, if I start including all those phone calls, comments, whatever I could read or hear, many of which touched my heart; if I exclusively speak about them, perhaps I’ll require a few months to respond to them in some way or the other.
Ever since we have begun conversing with each other in ‘Mann Ki Baat’ through the medium of radio, I have noticed a pattern that in the sweltering heat of this season, most letters focus around topic pertaining to summer time.
And why should not things change?
In utterances of yours, in your experiences, in the examples that you quote, there exists immense inspiration, unfathomable energy, unparalleled warmth; a resolve to bring about something new for the country.
In Uttar Pradesh, when a woman builds 125 toilets after overcoming steep challenges, inspiring women to exercise their due rights, it gives us a glimpse of ‘Matri- Shakti’, the power of maternal love & caring.
The name ‘India’ now evokes a sense of awe & respect; the reason behind it is the ‘Purusharth’, the resolute yet selfless inner strength of such illustrious sons & daughters of Mother India.
Today, the entire country, the youth, women, the marginalized, the underprivileged, the middle class, in fact every section has awakened to a new confidence … YES, we can go forward, the country can take great strides.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji – they all recognized agriculture and the farmer as vital aspects of the nation’s economy and also for the common man’s life.
Which newer programmes can be initiated?
What new practices or procedures can be adopted?
Usually, the country’s Television and electronic media do a variety of programmes on Yoga the whole year.
I appeal to the listeners of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ to provide this information about Jan Anshadhi Kendras to the needy ones – it will cut their expense on medicines.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of India’s industrialization.
Today, the campaign of Make in India is progressing successfully in consonance with Dr. Ambedkarji’s dream of India as an industrial super power-that vision of his has become our inspiration today.
It is an India which is Ambedkar’s India, of the poor and the backward.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar from April 14 to May 5 ‘Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan,’ is being organized.

I was privileged to welcome him during his New Delhi visit last May.
I am happy to renew our friendship and India’s support.
During this visit I got the opportunity to pay my tributes at the tomb of Abu Omar.
He was among the top leaders of his time.
His role in Palestinian struggle is unprecedented.
Abu Omar was also a distinguished friend of India.
Visiting the museum dedicated to him has also been an unforgettable experience for me.
Once again I offer my heartfelt tributes to Abu Omar.

India is a very old ally in Palestine’s nation-building efforts.
We have cooperation in the areas of training, technology, infrastructure development, project assistance and budgetary support.
After its creation, we hope that this institution will work as a center which enhances employment skills and services.
India is also collaborating to set up an Institute of Diplomacy in Ramallah.
We believe that this institute will emerge as a world-class training institute for the young diplomats of Palestine.
Our capacity building cooperation involves mutual training for long and short-term courses.
Training and scholarship slots for Palestine in leading Indian educational institutions of different sectors such as finance, management, rural development and information technology were recently extended.
I am happy that during this visit we are extending our development cooperation.
India will continue to invest in Palestine in the projects of health, educational infrastructure and women empowerment center and also in a printing press.
We consider this contribution as building blocks for the creation of an energetic Palestine State.
At the bilateral level, we have agreed to make our relations deeper through the Ministerial level Joint Commission Meeting.
Last year, for the first time, there was an exchange between the youth delegations of India and Palestine.
Investing in our youth and cooperating in their skill development and relationships is a shared priority.
India is also a young country like Palestine.
They are our future and inheritors of our friendship.
I am happy to announce that we will increase the exchange of young persons from 50 to 100 from this year.
Ladies & Gentlemen,
In our discussion today, I once again assured President Abbas that India is committed to take care of the interests of the Palestinian people.
India hopes that Palestine soon becomes a sovereign and independent country in a peaceful atmosphere.
President Abbas and I had discussions on recent regional and global developments related to the peace and security of Palestine and its peace process.
India greatly hopes for peace and stability in this region.
We believe that permanent solution to the issue of Palestine is ultimately contained in negotiations and understanding through which a path to a peaceful coexistence can be obtained.
Intense diplomacy and judiciousness alone can help to achieve freedom from this cycle of violence and from the burden of the history.
We know it is not easy.
But we must constantly keep on trying because there is so much at stake.
Your Excellency, I express my heartfelt gratitude for your wonderful hospitality.
I, on behalf of 1.25 billion Indians, also extend warm greetings for the progress and prosperity of the people of Palestine.

Friends, I have had the pleasure of interacting with renowned Scientists in the beginning of every year.
I am glad that today, an auspicious opportunity allows me to share some thoughts with you.
He was a self-taught scholar.
He succeeded despite many constraints.
His path-breaking work in 1924 was due to his single-minded devotion to uncharted science.
It laid the foundations of Quantum Statistics and a basis for modern Atomic Theory.
Einstein’s biographer Abraham Pace regarded his work as one of the last four revolutionary papers on old Quantum Theory.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose has been immortalized in the history of science by concepts and terms, like Bose Statistics, Bose Einstein Condensation and Higgs Boson.
The fundamental importance of his work may be gauged from the fact that several Nobel Prizes in Physics have been awarded subsequently to researchers carrying forward his ideas to diverse physical applications.
Professor Bose was a crusader for teaching of science in vernacular languages.
He started the Bengali science magazine Gyan-o-Bigyan.
To promote understanding and love of science in our youth, it is vital that we promote science communication in a big way.
Language should not be a barrier but a facilitator in this task.
Distinguished Scientists and Students, You all have studied and are probably also experts of Quantum Mechanics.
I have not studied it.
But I understand that there are many lessons that Physics can teach us in day to day life.
A classical particle cannot escape easily from inside a deep well.
But a quantum particle can!
For one reason or another, we have confined ourselves into isolation.
We hardly cooperate, collaborate and share our experiences with fellow scientists of other Institutions and National Laboratories.
To reach our true potential and to take Indian science to its rightful glory, we should be like a quantum particle that escapes its confinement.
A mechanism is being put up for strong collaborations between academic and R&D institutions.
City based R&D Clusters are being created to bring together all Science and Technology partners from Academia to Institutes, to Industries to Startups.
The success of this effort, will depend on our ability to bring all institutions and labs under this strategy.
It requires whole-hearted support from each of us.
The mechanism should ensure that a scientist from the remotest corner of the country has seamless access to resources in, say, IIT Delhi, or say, a CSIR Lab in Dehradun.
Friends, for various reasons, we missed the first Industrial revolution.
We cannot miss similar opportunities today.
Upcoming sectors such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Cyber-physical systems, Genomics, and Electric Vehicles are new challenges that require your attention.
Please ensure, that as a country, we keep pace with these emerging technologies and innovations.
Friends, inaugurations serve a purpose, only if you have a follow-up plan of action.
I am happy to learn that this one has exciting and important follow-up events lined up.

I wish you all a very fulfilling and creative New Year.

A very warm welcome to you all!
The achievers being felicitated tonight on this auspicious occasion, all of you who have assembled here today from various locations, business and industry stalwarts, fellow citizens, youngsters connected through TV, radio, Ladies and gentlemen.
Today, we are celebrating the Foundation day of Institute of Charted Accountant of India (ICAI).My heartfelt wishes to one and all on this momentous occasion.
You are the pillars of a sound Economic and financial ecosystem of this country, and it is indeed a great honour to be a part of this conglomerate.
In a way it is indeed a great opportunity for me to learn and share with you today.
Chartered Accountants of India have earned laurels across the globe for their dexterity in Financial Skills.
Friends, our scriptures have laid down four Purusharthas-the objects of human pursuits.
It is the moral responsibility of all of you engaged in the profession of Chartered Accountancy to guide one towards righteous conduct and practice.
I am indebted to you for having allowed me to share my thoughts with you.
We share the same patriotic values and envision great accomplishments for the nation and its citizens.
But, let us face some harsh realities!
These often set you thinking.
You might have heard from the experienced in the society that in case a house is engulfed in fire and there is complete loss of property, it is said that the family can get back on its own with its will power and perseverance.
They cope up with the trauma but begin afresh with the same fervour.
Within no time they bounce back.
Even if one family member treads the wrong path, the family is shattered once and for all.
Dear friends, you are engaged in setting the accounts right If we are righteous, the country can be salvaged from the biggest of crises.
During the worst of the natural calamities like floods and earthquakes, the citizens have shown their capabilities to take care of the cause of the nation while supporting the administration.
However, if some of the citizens of the country are into the habit of stealing and pilferage, it leads to an irreparable damage to the family and the nation.
Government has cracked down heavily to nab such pilferers over the past three years.
The latest statistics from Swiss bank accounts stand a testimony to the strict measures by the government on the Black Money issue.
Three decades back in 1987, these officials from Swiss Banks had started declaring how much deposits were being made by nationals of a country.
According to the reports released for the last financial year, there has been a reduction of 45% in the deposits made by Indians in the Swiss banks..
Ever since 2014, the day you all entrusted us with the reins of the nation, we have put brakes on the trends.
You will be shocked and appalled to know that in 2013 Swiss Banks had reported a 42% increase in black money deposits.
Ladies and gentlemen, two years later when we shall start receiving real time data from Switzerland, imagine the plight of the black money holders.
I am telling you these things with the hope that you might connect with the thoughts of this government and the strength of the politicians.
Stern actions shall be taken against them.
More stringent actions are in store for the companies who will break the law in future.
My Chartered Accountant friends, I have come here on the occasion of the Foundation day of your institute.
I want to ask you a light question.
The power to keep the account right lies with you.
After demonetization, someone definitely might have helped those companies.
And if we add all those chartered accountants and ‘articled assistants’ and all your staff then roughly these numbers will be more than eight lakhs.
These figures may astonish you; yet only 32 lakh people in our country say that their income is more than ten lakhs while filing tax returns.
Can any one of you believe it?
I am asking you, the corrector of the account books.
Are there only 32 lakh people in this country who earn more than 10 lakhs?
These numbers show that only 32 lakh people in the country reveal their income to be more than ten lakh rupees.
I believe that most of the people in the country are salaried class, where people have fixed income and most of the salary is drawn from the government.
And so brothers I do not want to project data further.
But by this you will understand that crores of vehicles are purchased every year in the country.
And yet the responsibilities towards the country are not getting fulfilled; it is a matter of grave concern.
Instead of referring to more data, I want to put my thoughts before you.
CA brothers, a person or a client pays taxes only when the environment around him is conducive which motivates him to pay the taxes honestly.
If he sees that the advisor himself is asking him to hide the truth then he will boldly traverse the wrong path.
Thus it is equally important to identify such wrong advisors and take strict actions against them.
CA is an arrangement in which Human Resource Development (HR) is done only by you.
Did only 25 people make a mess?
And I have heard that more than 1400 cases are still pending for many years now.
Tell me my friends, is it a matter of concern or not, for such highly Qualified Professionals?
They knew the law.
They were aware of the consequences of fighting against the law.
Despite this, all the lawyers of that era who had well flourishing law profession left their advocacy for this country.
Many of them played a decisive role in framing of our constitution.
Friends, today our country is at another crucial juncture of history.
After the country’s political integration in 1947, today the country is getting economically integrated.
Our country is beginning a new journey this year, 2017, when the dream of ‘One Nation, One tax, One market’ has become a reality.
Try to fathom my feelings, friends.
During the freedom movement, the lawyers had placed their lives at stake for the freedom of India.
Hence the reins of leadership of this new era have to be in your hands, just as the movement for freedom was led by those lawyers.
Today the economic development will be led by the army of my Chartered Accountants.
And you can see that no one but you can make this road to the greater economic development stronger.
I request you again to take your clients to the path of honesty so as to end corruption.
To eliminate corruption, you have to take the command.
Friends, Chartered Accountants are like ambassadors of any country’s economic system.
Your signature is more powerful than that of a Prime Minister.
Your signature is a testimony to the trust in the truth.
Companies may be small or big, however, if you certify their books of account then the government believes in that, people of the country believe in that.
And have you ever thought that once you have signed a balance sheet then no one questions the balance sheet of that company; files are not held up after that.
Friends, a new chapter begins after that.
Today, I’ve come here to showcase that new life to you people.
Friends, however, the matter doesn’t end there.
The first of July, the date of your foundation, gives you another opportunity to restore that faith.
Friends, there are different definitions for the term ‘tax return’.
It provides a gas connection to a lady who has used woods for cooking food all her life.
The money collected through taxes is being used for those brave soldiers who risk their lives on the border to protect us.
This money is being used in providing electricity to those households that don’t have electricity supply even after seventy years of independence.
Not a single bulb was ever illuminated in their homes; they have been living without electricity.
What could be a greater service than helping the country’s poor in providing what is due to them.
And once you decide then I’m confident that the 1st of July 2017 will certainly become a turning point in the history of ICAI.
And, friends, once you take a vow then I can say with confidence that nobody will try to evade taxes.
People only break laws when they know that there is someone to protect them.
When I was on the way to this place, Neelesh told me that you people are going to help the traders to understand GST.
I congratulate him, I offer my gratitude.
You please reach out to the people, enlighten them.
Encourage them to join the mainstream of integrity.
In a way, the government has provided a fresh opportunity to the people in the field of chartered accountancy.
Please prepare yourself for this; I specifically urge the young professionals in this field.
Please come forward, Chartered Accountants have an extremely important role in the success and proper implementation of the laws recently passed by the government, particularly the insolvency and bankruptcy code.
Under this code when a company has been declared bankrupt then its control will be passed on to an insolvency practitioner.
However, whichever path you people choose today, in that path, the term CA should mean Charter and Accuracy, Compliance and Authenticity.
Friends, our country is going to complete 75 years of its independence in 2022.
The country has set some targets for the year 2022.
New India has been expecting hard work and industry from all of us.
What kind of India we want to see when it completes 75 years of its independence as an institute, as a chartered accountant, as an individual and also as a citizen and play our role, contribute in making the country like that.
You should prepare a roadmap for that historic occasion from today itself to scale new heights for the institution and its character.
You will have to decide on this.
You set a target for yourself that how many people you will bring in the mainstream by honestly paying the taxes.
Who can be a better judge than you yourself to set a target for this task?
Please also think how you can expand the role of technology in your profession.
We are nowhere in these big four.
You are capable of it and there is no dearth of talent either.
My friends you people must be respected world over in the field of chartered accountancy.
In the end, I’d like to remind you of an advice by the most revered economist – Chanakya.
I’ve come to invite you to associate yourself with the mainstream of India’s development.
Please don’t lose sight of the fact this profession has the capacity to protect, to sustain the entire economy.
I once again convey my best wishes to the entire faculty of the institute, to all the chartered accountants present here on the occasion of the foundation day of ICAI.
I also thank the people who are watching this programme through the video link and also to those chartered accountants of our country who are watching this programme in other countries.

PM-AASHA will provide MSP assurance to farmers A reflection of Government’s commitment to the “Annadata”
Giving a major boost to the pro-farmer initiatives of the Government and in keeping with its commitment and dedication for the Annadata, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved a new Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA).
The Scheme is aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce as announced in the Union Budget for 2018.
The other existing schemes of Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) for procurement of paddy, wheat and nutri-cereals/coarse grains and of Ministry of Textile for cotton and jute will be continued for providing MSP to farmers for these crops.
Therefore in addition to PDPS.
The pilot district/selected APMC(s) of district will cover one or more crop of oilseeds for which MSP is notified.
In addition to this, budget provision for procurement operations has also been increased and Rs. 15,053 crore is sanctioned for PM-AASHA implementation.
For procurement of these agri-commodities during 2010-14, Government Guarantee of Rs. 2500 crore was provided with expenditure of only Rs. 300 crore; while during 2014-18, Guarantee amount has been increased to Rs. 29,000 crore with expenditure of Rs. 1,000 crore.
Increasing MSP is not adequate and it is more important that farmers should get full benefit of the announced MSP.
The procurement expenditure and losses due to procurement will be borne by Central Government as per norms.
All payment will be done directly into registered bank account of the farmer.
This scheme does not involve any physical procurement of crops as farmers are paid the difference between the MSP price and Sale/modal price on disposal in notified market.
The support of central government for PDPS will be given as per norms.
The emphasis is on enhancing productivity, reducing cost of cultivation and strengthening post-harvesting management, including market structure.
Several market reforms have been initiated.
These include Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing Act, 2017 and Model Contract Farming and Services Act, 2018.
Many States have taken steps to adopt these through legislation.
Efforts are on for a new market architecture, so as to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices on their produce.
These include setting up of Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) so as to promote 22,000 number of retail markets in close proximity of farm gate; competitive and transparent wholesale trade at APMC through eNAM and a robust and pro-farmer export policy.
Besides, several other pro-farmers’ initiatives such as implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri KrishiSinchai Yojana, ParamparagatKrishi Vikas Yojana and distribution of Soil Health Cards have been undertaken.
The commitment for farmer welfare is also reflected by unprecedented decision of announcing minimum support price based on the formula of 1.5 times the cost of cultivation.

The signing of the agreement will help in deepening the educational ties between India and France and will go a long way in boosting the educational relationship between the two countries.
The agreement will be instrumental in encouraging mobility of students from both the countries by facilitating possibilities for them to continue their studies in the other country and would also promote excellence in higher education through innovative partnerships/collaborations and research activities which will be leading to the improvement of the quality of education in India.
Woman power in this state has always been a source of inspiration for the country.
Today on this occasion, I salute the great revolutionary and daughter of the nation Rani Gaidinliu.
I am also privileged to inaugurate today a park dedicated in her name.
Girls’ education is the foundation for women empowerment.
Only sometime back the Central Government launched nationwide ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ Program.
The Program has elicited nationwide positive results.

The state government has undertaken construction of a new hostel for girls in the tribal areas.
I am fortunate to inaugurate one such hostel today.
Women in Manipur are proactively involved in areas ranging from farming to handicrafts.
An all Women Market was envisaged so that women do not face any hardship in selling their products.
Women in Manipur can get huge benefit from this.
Today I also inaugurated 1000 Anganwadi Centers in the State.
These centers will work as a medium for improving the health of thousands of Mothers and their babies.
They will also benefit from the recently launched National Nutrition Mission on Women’s Day.
The objective of the Mission is to have a targeted approach on providing nutritious food, cleanliness, and vaccination.
Doctors, Teachers and Nurses posted in remote and far flung areas of Hill Districts face many hardships due to lack of proper accomodation at their respective places of posting.
To address this problem, I have laid the foundation stone for construction of acomodation for teachers, Doctors and Nurses at 19 specified locations in hill and remote areas.
I am sure this will go a long way in motivating medical personnel to render dedicated services to the people of these areas.
Our Government’s vision for the North East has been ‘Transformation by Transportation.’
Our focus is on connectivity.
Work is also in progress for connecting remote areas of Manipur by helicopter service.
Government is also working on various road projects.
I have also laid the foundation of an important road project today.
The foundation stone for a Cave Tourism project has also been laid.
I have always maintained that India’s growth story shall never be complete until the eastern part of our country progresses at par with the western part.
The North-East can be the New Engine of India’s growth.
We are addressing the special needs of the North East Region to enable growth parity with the rest of the country.
Various Ministries have been providing special dispensation for the North East under their ongoing schemes.
I have mandated my Cabinet colleagues to regularly visit the region and take stock of schemes for their effective implementation.
Till date more than 200 such visits have taken place by the Union Ministers.
I have visited the North East more than 25 times in the last 4 years.

In the last three years, on an average Rs.5,300 crore have been spent annually for development of Rail Network in the North East Region, which is two and half times of average spending in the previous 5 years.
The Jiribam Station in Manipur was connected by the broad gauge rail network in 2016.
I had flagged off the first passenger train to Jiribam in May 2016.
Today, seven out of eight States of North Eastern India are connected by Rail Network.
Projects are going on to connect the remaining State capitals including Imphal in North East to broad gauge network.
One of the highest bridges in the world having Pier height of 141 meter is being built on Jiribam-Imphal New Line Project.

In next 3 to 4 years, the Central Government is going to invest about Rs.30,000 Crores for development of National Highways and other important roads in Manipur State.
Apart from constructing National Highways, we are also focusing on connecting rural habitations with main roads under Prime Minister Grameen Sadak Yojana.
The Central Government has released more than Rs.1000 Crores in the last 4 years under this scheme to the state.
We have connected 150 habitations during this period.
All these efforts are reflection of our commitment for developing road connectivity in the State.
The Union Government has approved a new Central Sector Scheme of “North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme.”
This will fill up gaps in creation of infrastructure in specified sectors.

Of these, 49 candidates are from Manipur State.
Recently, Government of India has sanctioned ten India Reserve Battalions for North Eastern States which include two battalions for Manipur.
These two battalions will directly provide job opportunities to about 2,000 youth in the State.
These interactions were unheard of in the history of Manipur.
“Meeyamgi Numit” and “Hill Leaders’ Day” are efforts in this direction.
I am told, 24 such interactions have happened in which more than 19 thousand people have met the Chief Minister.
I am told, that the State Government is taking public grievances very seriously.
A Grievance Cell has also been set up in the Chief Minister’s Office with a toll free number.
The ‘Go to Hills’ initiative of the Government is a welcome step.
The Chief Minister with his entire cabinet has also travelled to all the hill districts to take the Government closer to the people.
Once Manipur decides something, no force can prevent it from happening.
In April 1944, it was in this land of Manipur that Netaji Bose’s INA gave the clarion call for freedom.

It is always a pleasure to return to Singapore.
It is a city that never fails to inspire.
This great nation has shown us that size is no barrier to the scale of achievements or the strength of a nation’s voice in the world.
And, in this wonderful mosaic, there is an ancient thread, beautiful and colourful, that binds India and Singapore.
The course of India’s centuries-old route to South East Asia also ran through Singapore.
The human link is deep and enduring.
It lives in the Singaporean Indians.
And, this evening has been lit-up with your presence, your energy, your talent and your achievements.
In turn, Singapore has embraced you, your merit and your hard work.
Here in Singapore, you represent the diversity of India.
If you want to see all festivals of India in one city, or celebrate them for weeks, Singapore is the place to visit.
That might also be true now for Indian food!
I still remember the dinner Prime Minister Lee hosted for me in Little India.
Tamil is an official language here.
But, it is a testimony to Singapore’s spirit that school children can also learn five other Indian languages.
The city throbs with the finest of Indian culture.
This is as much due to the talented Indian community as to the support from Singapore Government.
Here in Singapore you have even started a full competition in traditional Indian games.
It brings you memories of your youth and enables children to connect to kho kho and kabaddi.
And, in 2017, International Day of Yoga was held at 70 centres in this city.
That makes it one centre for every 10 square kilometres.
No other city in the world could have this Yogic intensity.
Institutions like Sri Ramakrishna Mission and Sri Narayana Mission have been here for decades.
In their service to society, without distinction between people, reflect the values that bind India and Singapore.
In their journey through Singapore and the region, the greatest of Indian thinkers Swami Vivekananda and poet Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore found a common chord that connects India to the East.
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s call to march for India’s freedom from the soil of Singapore -दिल्ली चलो- is an enduring flame in the heart of every Indian.
And, in 1948 a portion of Mahatma Gandhi’s ashes were immersed at Clifford Pier, just across the bay from here.
Thousands from all sections of society witnessed the ceremony.
A plane showered rose petals as the ashes were immersed.
People took sips of water from the sea.
Day after tomorrow, I will have the honour to unveil a plaque at Clifford Pier to mark that solemn moment of our history.
The moment which underlines even today the timeless and universal values of Mahatma Gandhi.
on the foundations of this extraordinary heritage, the wealth of our human links and the strength of our shared values, India and Singapore are building a partnership of our age.
It is a relationship that truly meets the test of strategic partnership.
When India opened up to the world and turned to the East, Singapore became a partner and a bridge between India and ASEAN.
Political relations between India and Singapore are among the warmest and closest.
There are no contests or claims, or doubts.
It is a natural partnership from a shared vision.
Our defence relations are among the strongest, for both.
My Armed Forces speak with great respect and admiration for Singapore’s Armed Forces.
India’s longest continuous naval exercise is with Singapore.
They are marking their Silver Jubilee now.
We are proud to host Singapore’s Army and Air Force for training in India.
Our ships regularly visit each other.
Many of you have been on board our naval ships.
I, too, am looking forward to visiting a Singapore Navy Ship and an Indian Naval Ship at the Changi Naval Base day after tomorrow.
In international forums, we speak in one voice in the cause of a rules-based order, sovereign equality of all nations, and free and open pathways of commerce and engagement.
Economics is the heart-beat of the relationship.
It is a partnership at the front-line of India’s global engagement.
Singapore is both a leading investment source and destination for India.
Singapore was the first country with which we signed a Comprehnsive Economic Cooperation Agreement.
Nearly 250 flights in each direction every week connect Singapore to 16 Indian cities.
And, that is set to grow.
India is the third largest source of tourists in Singapore and its fastest growing.
Our IT companies are helping Singapore stay smart and competitive.
In many area of India’s development priorities, Singapore is a key partner: smart cities, urban solutions, financial sector, skills development, ports, logistics, aviation and industrial parks.
So, India and Singapore are contributing to each other’s prosperity.
And, now we are building new partnerships for the digital world.
Prime Minister Lee and I just made a tour of an outstanding exhibition of technology, innovation and enterprise.
These are the bright youth of India and Singapore.
Many of them are brilliant talent from India that have made Singapore home.
They will be the bridge of innovation and enterprise between India, Singapore and ASEAN.
A short while ago, we saw the international launch of RuPay, BHIM and UPI.
It is natural for these to be launched in Singapore!
Together, we will work for using the power of mobile and digital technology for governance and inclusion.
Together, we can build a great economic partnership of the new age.
As Singapore shapes a new future for itself, India emerges as the new global frontier of opportunities.
Even in a year of deep structural reforms like the introduction of Goods and Services Tax, we remain the fastest growing major economy of the world.
And we intend to stay that-way.
Current account deficit is comfortable.
The currency is stable.
And, the foreign exchange reserves are at a record high.
In India, the present is changing rapidly.
A ‘New India’ is taking shape.
And, there are many reasons for it.
One, Economic reforms are taking place at a speed and a scale not known so far.
Over 10,000 measures by Central and state governments in the last two years have helped us move up 42 places in the Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Over 1,400 out-dated laws have been repealed.
India is among the most open economies in the world.
Foreign investors can go into almost all sectors, often with up to 100% equity.
Indeed, more than 90% of investments in India are through this route.
This was not an easy task.
But, it was done successfully.
And, it has created new economic opportunities.
Our personal income tax base has also expanded by nearly 20 million.
Three, our infrastructure sector is expanding at record speed.
Pace of rail track addition has doubled.
Metro rails in several cities, seven High Speed Rail Projects, dedicated freight corridors, and modernisation of 400 railway stations will transform the rail sector.
Other projects include 10 green field airports; five new major ports; 111 rivers designated as National Water-ways; and over 30 logistics parks.
We added over 80 thousand mega-watts of power in just three years.
And, in renewable energy, we have become the sixth largest producer in the world.
That is our commitment to a green and sustainable future.
Quite simply, the biggest infrastructure story of the world is unfolding in India.
Four, our manufacturing sector is rebounding.
There is also special focus on the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Sector.
We have launched sector-specific modernisation and productivity programmes, reduced corporate tax rate, and made tax benefits more attractive and easier.
The Indian Startup sector is flourishing, and is now the third largest in the world.
Now, 99% of Indian house-holds have a bank account.
Six, a digital revolution is sweeping through India.
And, it is also transforming everything else in India: governance, public service, delivery of benefits to the poor, putting banking and pension within the reach of the poorest.
For example, digital transactions are growing rapidly.
In 2017, just the UPI-based transactions grew seven thousand percent.
These will offer many digital services and create thousands of rural jobs.
One of the exhibitors today is from one of these labs.
Seven, India will experience the largest wave of urbanisation in the world over the next two decades.
It is a challenge, but also a huge responsibility and opportunity.
We are working to transform 100 cities into Smart Cities, and 115 aspirational districts into new centres of progress.
Mass transit, waste management, pollution control, sustainable habitat and affordable housing are programmes of great priority for us.
Eight, we are investing in skills and raising the standards of higher education to give a life of dignity and opportunity for our 800 million youth.
With learning from Singapore, we are setting up advanced Institutes of Skill Development.
Nine, Agriculture sector is receiving a level of priority that it has not since the Green Revolution decades ago.
For this, we are using technology, remote sensing, internet, digital financial system, soft credit, insurance, soil health improvement, irrigation, pricing and connectivity.
Ten, we want every citizen to enjoy what I call ‘Ease of Living’ by 2022.
It means, for example, 50 million new houses so that there is roof over every head in 2022.
Last month, we reached a milestone.
Each one of our 600 thousand villages are now connected to a power grid.
We are also working to provide electric connection to every household.
We have launched this year AYUSHMAN Bharat, the National Health Insurance Scheme.
It will cover 100 million families or 500 million Indians with annual coverage of 8000 U.S. dollars.
This is simply the largest healthcare scheme in the world.
Quality of life is also linked to clean and sustainable development.
That is one of our principal goals.
It is rooted in our heritage and our commitment to the planet’s future.
And, it informs every aspect of public policy and economic choices in India now.
It includes our mission of Clean India, clean rivers, clean air and clean cities.
And, all these changes are taking place because of one and only one reason: our people.
There is complete clarity and confidence about the pace and direction of economic reforms in India.
We will make it easier and smoother to do business in India.
We will work for an open, stable and fair international trade regime.
We want to see a comprehnsive fair, balanced agreement that lifts up all nations on the tide of trade and investment.
We will work with all, most of all with ASEAN, to reach an early conclusion to Regional Comprehnsive Economic Partnership.
As India’s engagement with the region grows, Singapore will remain a gateway to ASEAN and the broader East.
This year, Sinagapore’s Chairmanship of ASEAN will take India’s relations with ASEAN further and farther ahead.
In conclusion For Singapore, there is no better opportunity than India.
Few countries have so much in common and so much in potential as India and Singapore.
We pursue a world based on rule of law, and connected by open seas and a stable trade regime.
The future is a world of unlimited opportunities.
It belongs to us.
It is up to us to be ambitious and bold to seize it.
This evening tells us that we are on the right path.
The two lions shall step into the future together.

Railway/RLDA/IRSDC will be planning and development authority for Railway land in consultation with urban local bodies, DDA or other UTs, to transfer land on free hold basis to Railways.

These redevelopment efforts will lead to creation of State-of-the-art smart stations that will function as mini smart cities.
Railway passengers and Industry shall be benefited at large.
Passengers will now get amenities at par with international railway terminals and a large number of local job creation is expected as a positive external outcome of this program.
Background: A Cabinet approval was obtained on 24th June 2015 to redevelop ‘A1’ and ‘A’ category stations by Zonal Railways through Cabinet approved procedures and for a lease period of 45 years.
However, insufficient interest was visible amongst the prospective bidders.
During various interactions with developers, investors and other stakeholders, various issues including multiple sub leasing, simplified bid procedures etc. were repeatedly raised.
Therefore, an improvised and simpler program design including these issues and under a specialized executing agency (IRSDC), incorporating suitable structural, process and parameters changes, has been adopted to revamp the station redevelopment program.
He said conditions prevailing today are quite different from about two decades ago, and would evolve much further over the next few years.
Elaborating on this, the Prime Minister said that earlier, Government was almost the sole provider of goods and services, which left a lot of scope for ignoring one’s shortcomings.
However, now, very often, people perceive that the private sector offers better services than Government.
The Prime Minister said that with alternatives now being available in several areas, the responsibilities of Government officers have increased.
He added that this increase is not in terms of scope of work, but in terms of the challenge.
The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of competition, which brings qualitative change.
He said that the sooner the attitude of Government can change from regulator to enabler, the faster this challenge of competition will become an opportunity.
The Prime Minister said that while the absence of Government in a sphere of activity should be perceptible, its presence in a sphere of activity should not become a burden.
He asked civil servants to strive towards such arrangements.
Noting the quantum jump in the applications for Civil Service Day awards, from less than 100 last year to over 500 this year, the Prime Minister said that the focus should now be on improving quality, and making excellence a habit.
The Prime Minister urged senior officers to ensure that experience does not become a burden that stifles innovation of younger officers.
Shri Narendra Modi said that anonymity is one of the greatest strengths of the civil services.
Speaking in the context of “reform, perform and transform”, the Prime Minister said that political will is needed for reform, but the “perform” part of this formulation must come from civil servants, while transformation is enabled by people’s participation.
The Prime Minister said that civil servants must ensure that every decision is taken keeping national interest in mind, and this should be their touchstone for taking a decision.
Recalling that the year 2022 would mark 75 years of independence, he urged civil servants to play the role of catalytic agents in fulfilling the dreams of freedom fighters.
The Prime Minister recalled the recent ASEAN India Commemorative Summit celebrating 25 years of partnership between ASEAN and India.

It is the strength of the people that builds a nation
We have to build a New India, which is free from politics of caste, communalism and corruption.

The city of Surat is blessed with remarkable determination.

Such marathons augur well for the health of people.
I appeal to people to embrace sports.
It brings good health and furthers a spirit of teamwork.
To build a New India is our mission.
It is the best tribute to the great women and men who gave their lives for India’s freedom.
Praising the dedication and commitment of Prof. Swaminathan, the Prime Minister described him as a “Kisan Vaigyanik” – Farmers’ Scientist; rather than just a “Krishi Vaigyanik” – Agricultural Scientist.
The Prime Minister said a combination of modern scientific methods and traditional agricultural knowledge would bring about the best possible results.
Giving examples from some States, he said each district in India should have its own “Agri-Identity.”

This diversity is India’s greatest strength.
May these festivals bring abundance of happiness and prosperity in the lives of our hardworking farmers”, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya on his Punya Tithi.
“Pandit Deendayal Ji remains our inspiration.
Selfless service came naturally to him.
His life was devoted to serving the nation and the poor.
Our Government remains committed to Pandit Deendayal ji’s idea of Antyodaya or serving the very last person in the society.
I also remember Pandit Deendayal ji’s exemplary skills as a political organiser.
He groomed several Karyakartas, who went on to give their lives to the nation.
During the interaction, officers shared their experiences on subjects such as innovation and teamwork in governance, healthcare, health education, agriculture, water resources, e-governance, tax administration and GST, ease of doing business, grievance redressal, and child rights.
The Prime Minister urged the officers to work towards improving the processes of governance.
He said a human touch is essential for developing team spirit, which can deliver better collective results.
Highlighting the current positive global environment in favour of India, the Prime Minister asked officers to work with clear objectives towards creating a New India by 2022.
These facts coupled with the stagnation in various grades of the service necessitated a review of the structure of ITS.
In business, like in politics, both time and timing are very important.
But sometimes despite our best efforts we cannot help it.
I am delighted to be here in Manila, on my very first visit to the Philippines.
No wonder so many of our top IT companies have invested here.
These are not only historical bonds.
This is a living shared heritage.
We wish to bring our economic and business relations up to the same level.
We are working day and night to ensure Good Governance which includes easy, effective and transparent Governance.
To give you an example: we have started open auction for natural resources including telecom spectrum, coal mines and other minerals and even private radio channels.
This has together contributed about 75 billion US dollars in revenue.
These steps, coupled with demonetization of high value notes has resulted in formalizing a large part of our economy.
Digital transactions have increased by 34 per cent in one year, as we march towards a less-cash economy.
An online citizen engagement platform, MyGov has harnessed ideas, suggestions and inputs on policies and programmes from 2 million pro-active citizens.
In keeping with our emphasis on minimum government and maximum governance, 1200 out-dated laws have been repealed in three years.
New laws and institutions for Bankruptcy and Insolvency as well as IPR and Arbitration are now in place.
We have simplified industrial licensing, and introduced online application process for environmental and forest clearances.
All these have made opening a new business very easy.
The results are obvious .
India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index this year.
Compared to last three years, we have received 67 per cent more FDI in this year.
This is no small achievement given the vastness and diversity of our country and the federal nature of our polity.
At the same time, we strongly believe that this is not enough.
Friends, A very large part of India’s population had no access to banking services.
This deprived them of the opportunities for savings as well as access to institutional credit.
With the Jan Dhan Yojana, within a matter of months, the lives of millions of Indians were transformed.
Nearly 200 million Ru-pay cards were issued for easy cash-less transactions.
Access to banking services by the poor has also played a major role in tackling corruption in government.
Through this initiative, we are committed to transform India as a major player in the global value chain.
We want to make India a global manufacturing hub.
At the same time, we want our youth to be job creators; not just job seekers.
For the first time in India, collateral-free loans have been dis-bursed to more than 90 million small entrepreneurs under the Mudra scheme.
Very near to the population of Philippines.
This is a recognition of the contribution of small entrepreneurs in the economy and to empower a person who has a work-able business idea but no collateral.
I see the importance being given to entrepreneur- -ship in the Philippines and in ASEAN region.
The ASEAN Mentor-ship for Entrepreneurs launched at this Summit is a commendable initiative that addresses another felt need of entrepreneurs.
Indeed, for the near future, South and South East Asia will be the growth engine of the world.
Hence, building connectivity with ASEAN is a key objective for India.
Work is already on in the construction of the tri-lateral highway through Myanmar and Thailand to connect to other countries in South East Asia.
While some of you are already deeply involved in India, others are just discovering the possibilities that remain to be tapped.
To co-incide with the ASEAN –India Comme–morative Summit of ASEAN leaders in January next year, we are also organising the ASEAN-India Business and Investment Meet and Expo.
India wishes to participate in your growth story and we invite all of ASEAN to participate in ours.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today visited Sivagiri Mutt at Varkala in Kerala.

It is an added pleasure to be with the CEOs of both countries.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have just completed a fruitful interaction with Indian and Israeli business leaders through the bilateral CEOs Forum.
I have high hopes from this interaction and partnership of CEOs, which started last year.
It was a very special visit.
I experienced at close quarters the remarkable spirit of innovation, enterprise and perseverance that drives Israel.
There is new energy and purpose that has in-vigorated our ties over the last few years.
It will help take our cooperation to greater heights.
We stand on the cusp of a bright new chapter in India-Israel relations driven by our people and the mutual opportunities for betterment of their lives.
The role of business and industry is crucial in the transformation of our ties.
It is your combined efforts that will add real value to our interaction and produce concrete successes.
This Fund, to be utilized over a period of 5 years, is a welcome opportunity to combine the talent pool of the two countries in pursuit of path-breaking technological solutions that can be commercially exploited.
I strongly encourage enterprises in both countries to utilize this platform.
I hope this Conclave will spur co–development of new technologies.
In fact, the ground-work for this will be started from iCREATE day after tomorrow.
Israel is universally known as the Start-up nation with a unique eco-system for innovation and incubation.
The credit for this goes to the Israeli entrepreneurs.
You have made Israel a strong, stable and innovative economy.
You have made a country of 8 million people, shine as a global power-house of technology.
Whether it is Water Tech; or Agri-Tech; whether it is food production, its processing or conservation; Israel has been a shining example with new breakthru and advances.
Whether it is physical or virtual security; whether it is on land, water or space; your technology has won admiration.
Our motto is: Reform, Perform and Transform.
The results are two-fold.
On the one hand, our procedures, processes and systems are getting aligned with the best in the world.
Secondly, we are able to maintain the pace of faster growth.
In spite of deep structural reforms, we are among the fastest growing major economies.
FDI inflows are at an all-time high, with 40% rise.
Tremendous work is being done to skill and employ the youth.
This is our greatest opportunity as well as challenge.
For this purpose, we have started the Start-up India campaign.
There is vast potential for India-Israel partnership in this area.
The India-Israel Innovation Bridge will act as a link between the Start-ups of the two sides.
I have been saying that Indian Industries, start-ups and the academic institutions must collaborate with their Israeli counterparts to access the huge reservoir of knowledge.
• India has size and scale. • Israel has sharpness and edge.
There would be many ideas and technologies that can be useful for or can be commercially scaled up in India.
But we are not done yet.
We are positioning India as a global manufacturing hub leveraging the energy of our youth.
The ‘Make in India’ initiative is designed to help achieve this.
Through these initiatives, combined with the new eco-system of a formal economy and a unified tax regime, we are trying to create a NEW INDIA.
We are particularly keen to develop India into a knowledge-based, skill-supported and technology-driven society.
A grand beginning has already been made through Digital India and Skill India.
To enable this transformation, in the last few years, my Government has undertaken substantial reforms.
We have resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies.
We are now among the most open economies.
Just a few days ago, we have allowed 100% automatic route FDI in single brand retail and construction development.
We also opened up our national carrier, Air India, to foreign investors.
Every day we are making it easier to do business in India.
In taxation, we have carried out a number of historic reforms.
It is by far the biggest business and economic reform India has ever done.
With introduction of GST and of Financial Technologies and digital transactions, we have really moved towards a modern tax regime, which is also transparent, stable and predictable.
Many others, especially those with advanced water technologies and agri techniques, defence and security systems, and pharma knowledge have a foot-hold in India.
Similarly, Indian companies have significant presence in several sectors in Israel like IT, Irrigation and Pharma.
Diamond remains a strong link in our trade.
There are more business joint ventures today than before.
However, this is just the beginning.
Our trade with Israel has grown to more than 5 billion dollars.
But this is still well below the real potential.
We must attain the full potential of our ties.
This is not only a diplomatic imperative but also an economic one.
I welcome your suggestions on how to unlock our combined potential.
The spirit of innovation, adaptation and problem solving is inherent in both countries.
We have situations of plenty as well as scarcity of water.
We have situations of food being thrown away even as there are many who go hungry.
It presents a vast economic opportunity for Israeli companies.
I invite more and more Israeli people, businesses and companies to come and work in India.
Along with the Government and people, the business community of India too is keen to join hands.
I wish your companies and ventures all success.
I assure you of my support and that of my Government wherever it is required.
And I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his continuous support in fast-tracking India-Israel trade and economic collaboration.
I am confident many successes lie ahead for our partnership.

The Prime Minister said democratic and participative governance requires transparency and accountability.
He said CIC plays a key role in this regard.

In this context, he mentioned the MyGov citizen engagement platform.
The second pillar is listening to suggestions (Sujhaav).

The fourth pillar is activity (Sakreeyta).
The Prime Minister said that during the implementation of GST, there was active follow up on complaints and suggestions.
The fifth pillar is information (Soochna).
The Prime Minister said that it is the Government’s duty to inform citizens about its actions.

He said that citizens should be aware both about their rights and their duties.

This is the largest business delegation to have come to India from Netherlands.
And it clearly shows how much dynamism is there in our trade and investment relationship.
So many possibilities are there.
There are very few such countries, with whom we have this kind of momentum of high level visits in our relationships.
And for this momentum and for giving personal priority to the relations with India, I congratulate my friend Mark from the bottom of my heart.
And shared our own assessments of regional and global developments.
And we also met the prominent CEOs of both the countries.
Last year when I went to Netherlands, I had urged my friend Mark to think positively on becoming a member of the International Solar Alliance.
The expertise, the technology and the experience which Netherlands has in the field of solar power, whole world should benefit from it.
And I am happy that today Netherlands has become a member of the International Solar Alliance.
I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Rutte for this decision.
From UN Security Council to Multilateral Export Control Regimes, India and Netherlands have had very good and close cooperation and coordination.
And now International Solar Alliance will be a new dimension of our strong cooperation in international forums.
Hundreds of Dutch companies have been working in India for many years.
Similarly, Netherlands is also a very attractive destination for investment by Indian companies.
And therefore, meeting with the CEOs of both the countries is very useful.
I am happy that the business community in Netherlands is enthusiastic about opportunities being created in India.
I have also assured them of my strong commitment towards economic reforms in India.
Areas related to agriculture and food processing are particularly important for India.
These topics are connected with our Food Security and at the same time, it is also important for our goal of doubling the income of the farmers of India.
Netherlands has expertise in these areas.
Last year Netherlands participated as the Focus Country in World Food India Summit.
And I believe that in its next edition in 2019, participation of the Netherlands will be even more.
I am happy that the first Indo-Dutch Center of Excellence for vegetables has started in Baramati.
We are working together on other similar types of centers as well.
Similarly, our cooperation in urban development is also very dynamic.

PPP operators will be free to fix tariff based on market conditions.
The Board of the Port Authority has been delegated the power to fix the scale of rates for other port services and assets including land. d.
An independent Review Board has been proposed to be created to carry out the residual function of the erstwhile TAMP for Major Ports, to look into disputes between ports and PPP concessionaires, to review stressed PPP projects and suggest measures to review stressed PPP projects and suggest measures to revive such projects and to look into complaints regarding services rendered by the ports/private operators operating within the ports would be constituted. e.
The Boards of the Port Authority have been delegated full powers to enter into contracts, planning and development, fixing of tariff except in national interest, security and emergency arising out of inaction and default.

Oil Palm Area Expansion (ha)
Amount (Rs. in lakhs)
The waste land/degraded land/cultivable land in the oil palm growing states can be given on lease/rent or bought by private entrepreneurs/ cooperative bodies/ joint ventures for oil palm plantation.
However, financial assistance under NMOOP is available for 25 hectare.
Therefore, there is a need for relaxation of restrictions under NMOOP to attract corporate bodies towards oil palm and derive maximum benefit of 100% FDI.
A combination of individual farming, contract farming and captive plantation (by relaxing land ceiling norms) can only boost oil palm cultivation in the country.
The norms of assistance for various interventions were decided on the basis of prevailing prices at the time of formulation of the NMOOP programme.

This deed is commendable indeed; it also displays their commitment towards cleanliness and the environment.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, just a couple of months ago, when I mentioned ‘Fit India’, I did not think it would draw such a good response; that a large number of people would come forward to support it.
One realizes after playing, despite not knowing the language of a particular state, “Oh!

Twin Projects to curb waterlogging in Muktsar, Faridkot and Ferozpur in Punjab
1. Implementation of these twin projects would help in addressing the problem of water-logging in 84800 Ha of land in Muktsar, Faridkot and Ferozpur districts in South-West Punjab.
2. Implementation of these projects would address the problem of water logging in South-West Punjab and enhance the flows/ water availability in the two canals.
3. Farmers in the area would be benefitted due to stabilisation / improved irrigation in 98,739 Ha of land due to relining of Rajasthan Feeder and 69,086 Ha due to relining of Sirhind Feeder.
The Government of Punjab has reported considerable seepage loss due to damages in the lining of both Sirhind and Rajasthan Feeders.
As a result, apart from reduced flows in these canals, the adjacent areas have been affected by water logging causing huge agricultural losses.
The project would mitigate water logging problem and enhance the flows/ water availability in the two canals.

• We were directed together by destiny;
• We are driven together by dreams.
Our history had many common chapters.
With struggle and sacrifice, we changed the course of history.
Now, it is the time to work for economic freedom.
Thus, our relations rest upon our common desire to fulfil the aspirations of our people.
• We have been friends in adversities ;
• Now we should franchise in opportunities
With the blessings of our great leaders, both the countries have marched on the path of development.
Both South Africa and India are important players in the BRICS economies.
Our people at home and the world at large are looking at us with great expectations.
We can join handsto fulfil these twin expectations.
It is heartening that we have had very active and fruitful engagement on all possible fronts.
However, President Zuma and I have met several times in last two years.
South Africa is India’s key trade and investment partner.
In the last ten years, bilateral trade has grown almost 380%.
The story of investments also continues to be bright.
There is continuous flow of investments both ways.
More than 150 Indian companies are operating in South Africa.
Similarly, many companies of South Africa are doing excellent work in India.
However, the scope is tremendous.
The potential is increasing day by day.
This is because both countries are strengthening their economic fundamentals.
Therefore, we must look at ways to diversify our trade basket, to complement our needs and to serve the people.
Many leading Indian companies have a foot-print here.
They are engaged in a wide range of activities.
Many Indian CEOs are here with us.
My advice to them is to see that their business results into socio–economic transformation of this great country.
I have been advocating three Ps for India.
(Public Sector, Private Sector and People’s Partnership).
I have been emphasising on the Personal Sector.
The same applies here.
Skill development and community empowerment should be central to your business plans.
The spirit of African humanism , UBUNTU , should reflect in your business ethos.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi stood for.
We have always believed in nurturing and nourishing not in exploiting.
Encouraging fact is that our business engagement is not one way.
South African companies are also active in India.
South African business excellence and Indian capacities must leverage each other; for growth and development in our two countries.
In last two years we have worked very hard on all fronts to set the economy right.
We have got very encouraging results of our sincerity and hard work.
Today, India is a bright star in the global economy.
We are being seen as the engine of global growth.
India has become the fastest growing large economy in the world.
At a time of global slowdown, we have registered 7.6% growth in GDP.
World Bank, IMF and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days.
Not only that, in 2014-15, India contributed 12.5% of global growth.
Its contribution to global growth is 68% higher than its share of the world economy.
The FDI in this year has been the highest ever.
The ratings agency Moody’s has said that FDI inflows were all-time high in 2016, highlighting the success of our ‘Make in India’ initiative.
Both within and outside the country, it has captured the imagination of people, institutions, industries, businesses, media and the political leadership.
As part of the Make in India exercise, we have given emphasis on Ease of Doing Business.
We have taken decisive steps to ease the licensing processes and rationalize the provisions relating to clearances, returns, and inspections.
If I talk of some other indicators:
• India has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several global agencies and institutions.
• We have jumped 12 ranks in the latest global ranking by the World Bank on ease of doing business.
• India has also jumped 16 places on the World Economic Forum’s global competitive index.
Due to positive impact of our policies and practices, our confidence has gone up.
This also gives us motivation to further simplify our processes to become an easier place to do business.
An innovative Start-up India programme has also been launched to incubate ideas and develop them into enterprises.
All this is having a good impact on expansion of job market and rise in purchasing power of the people.
This finally leads to India becoming a place with better quality of life and higher living standards.
We have ensured that our growth is inclusive and embraces both rural and urban communities.
We are taking a leap towards next generation infrastructure in both core areas and social sectors.
Socio-economic challenges of both our countries are more or less same.
My advice is that the wheels of development should not be re-invented.
Our two countries are very uniquely positioned to complement each other.
• Nature has been kind on both of us.
We have immense natural resources.
The need is to properly harness them and to use them sustainably for welfare of the common man.
We can learn a lot from each other in this.
• We particularly want to engage with your world class mining companies.
We are both committed to clean and green pathways to progress.
At the same time, we need energy resources.
• With the help of a number of countries, we have formed the International Solar Alliance.
I hope that we will enrich and take advantage of this forum.
• Our two countries have the unique benefit of opposite seasons
When it is summer or mango season in India, it is winter here, and vice versa.
We can leverage this geographic advantage to market each other’s fruits, vegetables and other perishables
• India with its huge domestic market offers massive opportunities for your food processing industry.
Our collaboration in this sector will bring value for our farmers and our villages.
• We in India are working on very ambitious plans of infrastructure.
The task which is pending from the days of independence has to be completed fast now.
Together, we can do a lot to fill these gaps.
• India is best suited to help you in technology and skills.
Efforts are already underway in these areas.
At the India Africa Forum Summit held in New Delhi last year, we under-took to educate and train 50,000 Africans in India over the next five years.
We can work together in a number of areas.
• From Defence to Dairy;
• From Hardware to Software;
• From Medicines to Medical Tourism;
• From Soft Skills to Science and Technology.
There are opportunities for us.
India today is among the most open economies.
We have liberalised our FDI regime in most of the areas and in all possible ways.
We have rationalised our norms and made it simple for businesses to establish and grow.
To conclude, I would like to say that we have added institutional depth to our partnership.
Our BRICS business engagement and CEOs Forum have helped to expand and enrich our partnership.
Today, we have successfully held the 3rd Meeting of the India-South Africa CEOs Forum.
We value your recommen- -dations and look forward to putting them into practice.
We are thankful to the South African government for introducing 10 year BRICS (ब्रिक्स) visa for regular business travellers.
The Indian Industry is quite encouraged by the move.
In February this year, we launched our e-Visa programme for South Africa.
This is valid for short term tourist and business travellers.
You can now get your visa for India sitting at home in your email, and that too free of cost!
• Let us join hands once more;
• Let us commit ourselves together once again;
• This is necessary to fight the enemy of poverty;
• This is perhaps much more challenging;
• But we have to succeed;
• And this only can be our real tribute to our great leaders.
Remembering her on her Jayanti”, the Prime Minister said.
The MoU will enable establishment of a framework for enhanced cooperation in the field of military education concerning strategic and operational studies and promotion of closer and long-term cooperation between the two countries.
Given the geographical and cultural closeness between the two countries, there are many common challenges like countering terrorism that needs joint action.
Hence, there is a need for better coordination and cooperation among the armed forces.
The joint training and exercises will help to bring symmetry in capacities of the armed forces and contribute to countering and managing common threats and challenges much better.
The MoU enhances public accountability by way of exchange of information and technology between India and Bangladesh.

Distinguished scientists and delegates,
It is a great pleasure to begin the year in the company of leaders of science and technology from India and the world.
For our confidence about the future of India comes from our faith in you.
It is a huge honour and privilege to address the 103rd Science Congress in the centenary year of the University of Mysore.
Some of the tallest leaders of India have passed through the doors of this respected institution.
The history of the Science Congress and the University of Mysore began around the same time.
It was the time of a new awakening in India.
It sought not just freedom, but also human advancement in India.
It wanted not just an independent India, but an India that could stand independently on the strength of its human resources, scientific capabilities and industrial development.
This university is a testimony to the vision of a great generation of Indians.
Now, we have launched yet another revolution of empowerment and opportunities in India.
And, we are once again turning to our scientists and innovators to realize our goals of human welfare and economic development.
The world has progressed because of human instinct to enquire and explore for knowledge but also to address human challenges.
For him, the highest purpose of science was the transformation of the life of the weak, the under-privileged and the youth.
And, his life’s mission was a self-reliant and a self-assured India that was strong and cared for its people.
Our success spans from the core of the tiny atom to the vast frontier of space.
As we increase the level of our ambition for our people, we will also have to increase the scale of our efforts.
So, for me, good governance is not just about policy and decision making, transparency and accountability.
It is also about integrating science and technology into the choices we make and the strategies we pursue.
Our digital networks are expanding the quality and reach of public services and social benefits for the poor.
And, in the first ever National Space Conference, we identified 170 applications that touch almost every aspect of governance, development and conservation.
We are launching Startup India that will encourage innovation and enterprise.
We are creating technology incubators in academic institutions.
And, I have asked for a framework of Scientific Audit for scientific departments and institutions in the government.
It is with the same spirit of cooperative federalism that is shaping centre-state relations in every area, that I am encouraging greater scientific collaboration between Central and State institutions and agencies.
We will also try to increase the level of resources for science, and deploy them in accordance with our strategic priorities,
At the same time, innovation must not be just the goal of our science.
Innovation must also drive the scientific process.
Frugal innovation and crowd sourcing are examples of efficient and effective scientific enterprise.
And, innovation in approach is not just the obligation of the government, but also the responsibility of the private sector and the academia.
In a world of resource constraints and competing claims, we have to be smart in defining our priorities.
In 2015, the world took two historic steps.
Last September, the United Nations adopted the Development Agenda for 2030.
And, last November in Paris, the world came together to craft a historic agreement to change the course of our planet.
But, we achieved something else that is equally important.
We succeeded in bringing innovation and technology to the heart of the climate change discourse.
We were consistent in our message that it is not enough to speak of targets and restraints.
It is essential to find solutions that help us transition easily to a future of clean energy.
I also said in Paris that innovation is important not just for combating climate change, but also for climate justice.
For, the developed world must leave enough of the little carbon space left for developing countries to grow.
We pledged to double national investments in innovation; and, build a global partnership that combines the responsibility of governments with the innovative capacity of the private sector.
I also suggested an international network of 30-40 universities and labs focusing for next ten years on transforming the way we produce, distribute and consume energy.
We will also pursue this in G20.
We need innovation to make renewable energy much cheaper; more reliable; and, easier to connect to transmission grids.
This is especially critical for India to achieve our target of adding 175 GW of renewable generation by 2022.
We must also make fossil fuel like coal cleaner and more efficient.
And, we should tap newer sources of renewable energy, from ocean waves to geothermal energy.
So, at Paris, India launched an International Solar Alliance to forge a partnership between solar-rich countries.
We need science and technology not just to make clean energy an integral part of our existence, but also to combat the impact of climate change on our lives.
We have to develop climate resilient agriculture.
We must understand the impact of climate change on our weather, biodiversity, glaciers, and oceans; and, how to adjust to them.
We must strengthen our ability to forecast natural disasters.
We must also address the rising challenges of rapid urbanisation.
This will be critical for a sustainable world.
For the first time in human history, we are in an urban century.
By the middle of this century, two-thirds of the world’s population will live in cities.
A little less than 3.0 billion people will join the existing 3.5 billion urban dwellers.
And, 90% of the increase will come from developing countries.
Many urban clusters in Asia will exceed the population of mid-sized countries elsewhere in the world.
More than 50% of India will be living in urban habitats by 2050.
And, by 2025, India may already have more than 10% of the global urban population.
Studies suggest that nearly 40% of the global urban population lives in informal settlements, or slums, where they face a range of health and nutritional challenges.
Cities are the major engines of economic growth, employment opportunities and prosperity.
It is also a vision of sustainable cities that are both locomotives of our economies and havens of healthy living.
Urban agriculture and ecology should get more attention.
And, our children must breathe cleaner city air.
And, we need solutions that are comprehensive and rooted in science and innovation.
We need your inputs to make our cities more immune to the consequences of natural disasters and our homes more resilient.
This will also mean making retrofit of buildings affordable.
A sustainable future for this planet will depend not only on what we do on land, but also on how we treat our oceans.
We are at the cusp of a new era, where oceans will become important drivers of our economies.
Their sustainable use can bring prosperity; and, give us clean energy, new medicines and food security beyond just fisheries.
That is why I refer to the Small Island States as Large Ocean States.
Ocean is critical to India’s future, too, with over 1300 islands, a 7500 km coastline and 2.4 million square kilometers of Exclusive Economic Zone.
That is why, in the past year, we have increased our focus on ocean or blue economy.
We will raise the level of our scientific efforts in marine science.
We will set up an advanced centre of research in marine biology and biotechnology and establish a network of coastal and island research stations in India and abroad.
We have entered into agreements on marine science and ocean economy with several countries.
We will also hold an International Conference on “Ocean economy and Pacific Island Countries” in New Delhi in 2016.
Rivers have played as important a role in human history as oceans.
Civilisations have been nurtured by rivers.
And, rivers will remain critical for our future.
We need regulations, policy, investments and management to achieve our objective.
But, we will succeed only when we integrate technology, engineering and innovation into our efforts, not just to clean our rivers now but to keep them healthy in the future as well.
For this, we also need scientific understanding of the impact of urbanisation, farming, industrialisation and groundwater use and contamination on the river eco-system.
River is the soul of Nature.
India has a rich heritage of ecological knowledge.
We have scientific institutions and human resources to mount concerted national action on conservation of Nature that is rooted firmly in scientific studies and methods.
And, if we wish to restore the harmony between human and Nature, we must also harness the full potential of traditional knowledge.
Societies across the world have developed this enormous wealth through wisdom gathered over the ages.
And, they hold the secrets to economic, efficient, and, environment friendly solutions to many of our problems.
But, today they are at risk of extinction in our globalised world.
Like traditional knowledge, science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of Nature.
So, we must recognize that science, as we see it, does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world.
And, we must bridge the distance between traditional knowledge and modern science, so that we can craft local and more sustainable solutions for our challenges.
So, in agriculture, even as we seek to make our farms yield more, reduce the intensity of our water use, or increase the nutrient content of our farm output,
we should also integrate traditional techniques, local practices and organic farming to make our agriculture less resource intensive and more resilient.
And, in the area of health, modern medicines have transformed healthcare.
But, we must also use scientific techniques and methods to delve deeper into traditional medicines and practices like Yoga for more holistic lifestyle and change our paradigm from treatment to wellness.
This is especially important in dealing with growing challenge of lifestyle diseases that take a huge toll in terms of human lives and economic costs.
As a nation we still inhabit many worlds.
We also see the uncertainty and despair of many living at the edge of existence, looking for a life of hope, opportunity, dignity and equity.
We must meet these aspirations at a speed and on a scale that is rare in human history.
And, from the richness of our tradition, the consciousness of our age and the strength of our commitment to our world, we must choose the most sustainable path possible.
The success of one-sixth of humanity will also mean a more prosperous and a sustainable future for the world.
We can only do this with your leadership and support.
We will realise it when, in the words of Vikram Sarabhai, “we encourage scientists to interest themselves in problems outside their fields of specialization.”
Economy – when we find cost effective and efficient solutions.
Environment – when our carbon footprint is the lightest and the impact on the ecology is the least possible.
Energy – when our prosperity relies less on energy; and the energy we use keeps our skies blue and our earth green.
Empathy – when our efforts are in tune with our culture, circumstances and social challenges.
Equity – when science advances inclusive development and improves the welfare of the weakest.
This year we mark a hundred years of a significant moment in the history of science, when Albert Einstein published in 1916 “The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity”.
Today, we must recall the humanism that defined his thought: “Concern for man himself and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavours. “
Nothing can be a higher duty for us, whether we are in public life, or we are private citizens, and whether we are in business or explore science, than to leave the planet in a better state for our future generations.
Let the different disciplines of science, technology and engineering unite behind this common purpose.
PM salutes Divyangs on International Day of Persons with Disabilities
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, has saluted the determination of our Divyangs and has conveyed his best wishes to them.
“On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, I salute determination of our Divyang sisters and brothers and convey my best wishes to them.
Let us continue our ongoing efforts with renewed vigour and create a nation where both accessibility and equality prevail”, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his eighteenth interaction through PRAGATI – the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation.
Noting that a large number of complaints were related to corrupt practices of officials, he directed strictest possible action against Railway officials found guilty of corruption.
He asked the Indian Railways to work towards a unified single telephone number for all grievances and queries, including helpline in the case of an accident.
The Prime Minister reviewed the progress of vital infrastructure projects in the railway, road and power sectors, spread over several states including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Nagaland.
Among the projects reviewed today are: the Mumbai Metro, the Tirupati-Chennai Highway, long-pending road projects in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Manipur, and important power transmission lines in Jammu and Kashmir and the North-East.
Reviewing Mission Indradhanush for universal immunization of children, the Prime Minister asked for targeted attention in strict timeframes for the 100 worst performing districts in this regard.
He said youth organizations such as NCC and Nehru Yuva Kendra could be involved in the outreach effort to ensure that no child was left without the benefit of immunization.
Reviewing the implementation of Swachhta Action Plans, the Prime Minister said that events such as Swachhta fortnights should be converted into movements towards permanent solutions.
On the AMRUT Mission, the Prime Minister asked officials to quantify and document the gains achieved through the use of latest technology, such as LED bulbs, so that the benefits could be better appreciated by one and all.
The Prime Minister urged all Secretaries of the Government of India, and all Chief Secretaries of States, to come up with concrete plans and objectives for transformative change, to be achieved by the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022.
With regard to cleanliness, he urged for maximum efforts ahead of Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary by 2019.
PM meets Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, the Chief Executive of Afghanistan
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi met the Chief Executive of Afghanistan, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah today.
Prime Minister extended a warm welcome to Dr. Abdullah who would be delivering a Keynote Address at the Conference on Counter-terrorism-2016 being held in Jaipur.
Dr. Abdullah Abdullah recalled positively the maiden and successful visit of the Prime Minister to Afghanistan in December 2015.
He said that the visit re-energised the strategic partnership between the two countries.
He deeply appreciated the support being extended by India for infrastructure development and capacity building in Afghanistan.
Prime Minister expressed deep gratitude towards the Government and the National Security Forces of Afghanistan for their bravery and sacrifice in order to protect the Indians, especially during the attack on the Indian Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif on January 4-5, 2016.
Prime Minister reiterated India’s commitment to extend all possible support to the efforts of the Afghan people in building a peaceful, stable, prosperous, inclusive and democratic country.
The two leaders shared views on further deepening the strategic partnership, both in the bilateral and regional context.
An Agreement for visa free travel for diplomatic passport holders of the two countries was exchanged in the presence of the two leaders.
“The life and works of hundreds of Indian Scientists are a compelling testament of integration of deep fundamental insights with technology development and nation-building.
He said that now the time has come to take a step further, by adding “Jai Anusandhan.”
The Prime Minister emphasized that the pursuit of science is fulfilled through the achievement of two objectives: generation of profound or disruptive knowledge; and use of that knowledge for socio-economic good.
As we boost our discovery science ecosystem, we must also focus on innovation and start-ups, the Prime Minister said.
He said that the Government has launched the Atal Innovation Mission to promote innovation among our scientists.
“Our Scientists must commit themselves to addressing problems of affordable healthcare, housing, clean air, water and energy, agricultural productivity and food processing.
While Science is universal, technology must be local for providing solutions relevant to local needs and conditions,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that big data analysis, artificial intelligence, block-chain etc should be utilised in the agricultural sector, especially to help the farmers with relatively small farm-holdings.
He urged the scientists to work towards ease of living for the people.
In this context, he mentioned issues such as drought management in low rainfall areas; early disaster warning systems; tackling malnutrition; tackling diseases among children such as encephalitis; clean energy; clean drinking water; and cyber security.
He called for time-bound solutions through research, in these areas.
The Prime Minister mentioned major achievements of Indian science in 2018, including:
• production of aviation grade biofuel;
• Divya Nayan – a machine for visually impaired;
• inexpensive devices for diagnosis of cervical cancer, TB and dengue
• a real-time landslide warning system in the Sikkim-Darjeeling region.
He said that strong pathways to commercialization, are needed to leverage our Research & Development achievements, through industrial products.
The Prime Minister called for research, which is a fusion of Arts and Humanities, Social Science, Science and Technology.
Noting that our strengths in research and development are built on the backbone of our national laboratories, central universities, IITs, IISC, TIFR and IISERs, the Prime Minister said that a strong research ecosystem must be developed in the State Universities and Colleges, as well.
He announced that the Union Government has approved a National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems with an investment of over Rs. 3600 crore.
The Mission will cover in a seamless way, R&D, Technology Development, Human resources and Skills, Innovation, Start-up Ecosystem and strong Industry and International Collaborations, he added.
He expressed happiness that research has begun to find an effective solution for sickle cell anaemia.
He said that the ‘Prime Minister’s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council’ will help formulate appropriate Science and Technology interventions, catalyze collaborations across stakeholder Ministries and implement multi-stakeholder policy initiatives.
We have launched the ‘Prime Minister’s Research Fellows’ Scheme under which, a thousand bright minds from the best Institutions in the country will be offered direct admission in Ph.D. Programs in IITs and IISc, the Prime Minister said.
The scheme will catalyze quality research and address shortage of faculty in the premier Educational Institutions, he added.
My fellow citizens,
In God’s creation, humans are endowed with fundamental goodness.
With time, the distortions of badness creep in.
People feel suffocated in a bad environment, and struggle to come out of it.
Corruption, black money, and counterfeit notes had become so rampant in India’s social fabric, that even honest people were brought to their knees.
People were forced by circumstances, in defiance of their inherent goodness.
Indians have, with firm resolve and infinite patience, faced difficulties with a smile, re-defining the concept of sacrifice.
We have lived these ideals.
125 crore Indians have shown, in their fortitude, the importance we place in truth and goodness.
This has been written on the sands of time.
Indians have displayed the strength of people power, utmost discipline, and the ability to discern the truth in a storm of disinformation.
They have shown that resolute honesty, can defeat dishonesty.
They have shown how much, even people trapped in poverty, are willing to do, to build a glorious India.
The people, through persistence, sweat and toil, have demonstrated to the world, an unparalleled example of citizen sacrifice, for the brighter future of a nation.
It is historic, that both the people and the government are on the same side in this battle against evil.
The Government is well aware, that in this period, you had to queue up, and face difficulty in withdrawing your own money.
I received letters from many people.
They have shared their pain and sorrow with me, but also emphasized their support.
You have talked to me as one of your own.
In this fight against corruption and black money, it is clear that you wish to walk shoulder to shoulder with us.
They have especially been told to proactively resolve the problems in rural and remote areas.
There is no precedent globally, to what India has done.
Nations similar to us do not have the amount of currency that we had.
Over the last ten to twelve years, 500 and 1000 rupee currency notes were used less for legitimate transactions, and more for a parallel economy.
The excess of cash was fuelling inflation and black-marketing.
It was denying the poor, their due.
Lack of cash causes difficulty, but excess of cash is even more troublesome.
Our aim is to achieve a balance.
I am sure, if great sons of India like Jayaprakash Narayan, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Kamaraj had been present today, they would have applauded the patience, discipline and resolve of our countrymen.
It is a healthy trend for any nation, when the people wish to join the mainstream abiding by the law, and helping the Government in serving the poor.
I wish to share some information with you, which will either make you laugh, or make you angry.
According to information with the Government, there are only 24 lakh people in India who accept that their annual income is more than 10 lakh rupees.
Can we digest this?
Look at the big bungalows and big cars around you.
If we look at any big city, it would have lakhs of people with annual income of more than 10 lakh.
In this fight against corruption and black money, it is natural to debate the fate of the dishonest.
What punishment will they get?
The Law will take its own course, with its full force.
This Government is a friend of good people.
And it aims to build an enabling environment for the dishonest to return to the path of goodness.
It is also a bitter truth, that people have complaints of bad experiences at the hands of Government machinery, and some government officers.
This reality cannot be wished away.
No one can deny that Government officers have a greater responsibility than common citizens.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of all of us in Government, at central, state and local levels, to protect the common man, help the honest, and isolate the dishonest.
Friends, It is accepted the world over, that terrorism, Naxalism, Maoism, counterfeit currency trade, drug trade, human trafficking – all of these depend on black money.
These evils have become a festering sore on society and Governments.
Demonetistion has dealt a severe blow to these trades.
Today, youth who had turned to the wrong path, are returning to the mainstream in large numbers.
The fact that so much of the cash in circulation has been deposited in the banking system indicates the success of this mission.
Events of the last few days indicate that escape routes for the dishonest have all been sealed.
Technology has played a big role.
The habitual offenders will be forced to abandon their misdeeds and join the mainstream.
Friends, This also represents a golden opportunity for the country’s banking system.
During this period, bank employees have worked day and night.
Female employees too, worked till late hours as part of this mission.
Post office staff, banking correspondents- all did exceptional work.
Amid this herculean effort, some grave crimes by some officers in some banks have come to light.
Some Government officers have also committed serious offences, and tried to take advantage of the situation.
At this historic juncture, I wish to make an appeal to the banks.
History is witness that the Indian banking system has never received such a large amount of money, in such a short time.
While respecting the autonomy of the banks, I appeal to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities.
India is celebrating the centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay as Garib Kalyan Varsh.
Banks should also not let this opportunity slip.
They should take appropriate decisions in public interest promptly.
When policies and programmes are made with clear objectives in mind, not only are beneficiaries empowered, but both short term, and long term benefits are achieved.
Spending is carefully scrutinized, and chances of good results are maximized.
The more the villages, the poor, the farmers, the dalits, the tribals, the marginalized, the oppressed, the deprived and women are empowered, and financially enabled to stand on their own feet, the stronger the country will become, and the faster will be the pace of development.
Even so many years after independence, millions of poor do not have their own home.
When black money increased in our economy, houses became out of reach of even the middle class.
The Government has taken some major decisions to ensure homes for the poor, the neo middle class and the middle class.
Two new middle income categories have been created under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana in urban areas.
Loans of up to 9 lakh rupees taken in 2017, will receive interest subvention of 4 per cent.
Loans of up to 12 lakh rupees taken in 2017, will receive interest subvention of 3 per cent.
The number of houses being built for the poor, under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana in rural areas, is being increased by 33 per cent.
In addition to this, another scheme is being put in place for the neo middle and middle class in rural areas.
Loans of up to 2 lakh rupees taken in 2017, for new housing, or extension of housing in rural areas, will receive an interest subvention of 3 per cent.
Friends in the last few weeks, an impression was sought to be created that the agriculture sector has been destroyed.
Farmers themselves have given a fitting reply to those who were doing so.
Fertilizer offtake is up by 9 per cent.
During this period, the Government has taken care to ensure that farmers do not suffer for want of access to seeds, fertilisers and credit.
Farmers who have taken loans for the Rabi crop from District Cooperative Central Banks and Primary Societies, will not have to pay interest on such loans for a period of 60 days.
Farmers who have paid interest during the last two months, will receive these amounts back, directly into their bank accounts.
Arrangements are being made to provide farmers even better access to loans from cooperative banks and societies.
NABARD created a fund of 21,000 crore rupees last month.
Now, Government is adding 20,000 crore rupees more to this.
The loss that NABARD suffers by giving loans to cooperative banks and societies at low interest rates, shall be borne by the Government of India.
The Government has decided, that 3 crore farmers who have Kisan Credit Cards, will be given RuPay debit cards within three months.
Kisan Credit Cards were launched in 1998, but so far, it was essential to go to a bank, to use them.
Just as agriculture is vital for the economy, so are the medium and small scale enterprises also called the MSME sector.
Government of India underwrites loans given by banks to small businesses through a trust.
So far, loans were covered upto one crore rupees.
This limit is now being enhanced to 2 crore rupees.
Earlier the scheme only covered bank loans.
Hereafter it will cover loans given by NBFCs as well.
Many people connected with this sector have made cash deposits in the last few weeks.
Banks have been asked to take this into account when deciding on working capital.
A few days back, Government announced a major tax relief for small businesses.
Income of businesses with turnover of up to Rs 2 crores was calculated at 8% of the turnover.
Now, for such businesses income from digital transactions will be calculated at 6%.
The Government now aims to double this, giving priority to Dalits, Tribals, Backward Classes and Women.
A new scheme is being launched for pregnant women.
We are introducing a nation-wide scheme for financial assistance to pregnant women.
6000 rupees will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children.
This scheme will help reduce the maternal mortality rate, in a big way.
This will help ensure nutrition before and after delivery, and improve the health of mother and child.
So far, pregnant women in 53 districts were being given financial assistance of 4000 rupees, under a pilot project.
We are initiating a scheme for senior citizens.
Banks often reduce their deposit rates, when they receive a large volume of money.
This should not adversely impact senior citizens.
Under the scheme, senior citizens will receive a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent for a period of 10 years, on deposits upto 7.5 lakh rupees.
The interest will be paid monthly.
I urge all parties and leaders to move away from a “holier than thou approach,” to come together in prioritising transparency, and take firm steps to free politics of black money and corruption.
In our country, people ranging from the common man to the President, have at some point or another, advocated simultaneous conduct of state and national elections.
This is to break the endless cycle of elections, reduce election expenditure, and minimize pressure on the administrative machinery.
More and more people are transacting digitally.
Yesterday, Government has launched a new, swadeshi platform for digital transactions – named BHIM after Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
It will be good if social scientists also do the same.
As a nation, India’s villages, poor, farmers, youth, educated and uneducated men and women, have all displayed infinite patience and people power.
Now, a century later, we witness that the people of India continue to share that feeling towards truth and goodness.
Today, Mahatma Gandhi is not among us.
But the path towards truth that he showed us, is still most appropriate.
As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha, let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness.
We cannot allow this fight against black money and corruption to stop or slow down.
Firmness in truth is a guarantee for success.
A country of 125 crore, with 65 per cent below the age of 35, having the means, the resources, and the capability, has no reason to stay behind.
Let us all come together, to move ahead overcoming obstacles and constraints.
“Congratulations to Bajrang Punia for securing the Gold in Asian Wrestling Championship.
India is very proud of his exemplary accomplishment.” , the Prime Minister said.
Had the good fortune of interacting with Balraj Madhok ji on many occasions.
His demise is saddening.
Condolences to his family.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Noida – Greater Noida Metro Rail Project covering a length of 29.707 k.m.
Total completion cost of the project is Rs.5,503 crore.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended a function at Parliament House, for the unveiling and demonstration of a retrofit electric bus.
The bus has been converted from a diesel bus to a battery-operated electric bus.
This is an initiative of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, to provide clean, pollution-free transport for Members of Parliament.
One of these was “Mission Innovation,” launched jointly by US, France and India, with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to work towards development of green technologies.
The other was the creation of the International Solar Alliance of countries blessed with abundant sunlight.
The Headquarters of this alliance will be in Delhi, the Prime Minister said.
In this context, the Prime Minister appreciated the efforts of the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Shri Nitin Gadkari, in the launch of this bus.
The Prime Minister exhorted entrepreneurs to work towards producing cheap and efficient electric batteries in India, which could spur a drive towards clean public transportation.
The annual Central financial liability on account of this measure would be about Rs. 9,800 crore.
The implementation of this pay revision will enhance the teachers’ pay in the range of Rs. 10,400 and Rs. 49,800 as against the extant entry pay due to the implementation of the 6th Central Pay Commission for the pay of teachers.
This revision would register an entry pay growth in the range of 22% to 28 %.
For the State Govt. funded institutions, the revised pay scales will require adoption by the respective State Governments.
The Central Government will bear the additional burden of the States on account of revision of pay scales.
The measures proposed in the revised pay structure are expected to improve quality of higher education and also attract and retain talent.
Policy opens a big window for private investments: PPP component must for getting Central assistance
The policy opens a big window for private investments across a range of metro operations making PPP component mandatory for availing central assistance for new metro projects.
Private investment and other innovative forms of financing of metro projects have been made compulsory to meet the huge resource demand for capital intensive high capacity metro projects.
States, proposing new metro projects will be required to indicate in project report the proposals and investments that would be made for such services.
Setting up of Urban Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) has been made mandatory which is to prepare Comprehensive Mobility Plans for cities for ensuring complete multi-modal integration for optimal utilization of capacities.
Taking note of substantial social, economic and environmental gains of metro projects, the Policy stipulated a shift from the present ‘Financial Internal Rate of Return of 8%’ to ‘Economic Internal Rate of Return of 14%’ for approving metro projects, in line with global practices.
Under the policy, States need to adopt innovative mechanisms like Value Capture Financing tools to mobilize resources for financing metro projects by capturing a share of increase in the asset values through ‘Betterment Levy’.
States would also be required to enable low cost debt capital through issuance of corporate bonds for metro projects.
Seeking to ensure financial viability of metro projects, the new Metro Rail Policy requires the States to clearly indicate in the project report the measures to be taken for commercial/property development at stations and on other urban land and for other means of maximum non-fare revenue generation through advertisements, lease of space etc., backed by statutory support.
States are also required to commit to accord all required permissions and approvals.
The new policy empowers States to make rules and regulations and set up permanent Fare Fixation Authority for timely revision of fares.
States can take up metro projects exercising any of the three options for availing central assistance.
This can have a fixed and variable component depending on the quality of service.
Operational and revenue risk is borne by the owner.
2. Gross Cost Contract: Private operator is paid a fixed sum for the duration of the contract.
Operator to bear the O&M risk while the owner bears the revenue risk.
3. Net Cost Contract: Operator collects the complete revenue generated for the services provided.
If revenue generation is below the O&M cost, the owner may agree to compensate.
Metro Projects with a total length of 537 kms are in progress in 13 cities including the eight mentioned above.
New cities acquiring metro services are; Hyderabad (71 kms), Nagpur (38 kms), Ahmedabad (36 kms), Pune (31.25 kms) and Lucknow (23 kms).
Metro projects with a total length of 595 kms in 13 cities including 10 new cities are at various stages of planning and appraisal.
These are; Delhi Metro Phase IV- 103.93 km, Delhi & NCR-21.10 km, Vijayawada-26.03 km, Visakhapatnam-42.55 km, Bhopal-27.87 km, Indore-31.55 km, Kochi Metro Phase II-11.20 km, Greater Chandigarh Region Metro Project-37.56 km, Patna-27.88 km, Guwahati-61 km, Varanasi-29.24 km, Thiruvananthapuram & Kozhikode (Light Rail Transport)-35.12 km and Chennai Phase II-107.50 km.

This is truly an esteemed gathering of spiritual leaders, scholars and leaders from several countries of the world where Buddhism is a prevalent way of life.
It is a matter of immense happiness that this conference is being held in India, including in Bodh Gaya.
India is the ideal venue to host a symposium of this nature.
We in India are proud of the fact that it was from this land that Gautama Buddha gave the world the tenets of Buddhism.
The life of Gautama Buddha illustrates the power of service, compassion and, most importantly, renunciation.
He was born into privilege.
The hardships he faced were relatively fewer.
Yet, with age grew a distinct consciousness about human suffering, about illness, about old age and about death.
He was convinced that material wealth is not the sole goal.
Human conflicts repulsed him.
And then, he set out, on the path to create a peaceful and compassionate society.
Gautam Buddha was a revolutionary.
In three words, Appa Deepo Bhavah (अप्प दीपो भव) or be your own light, Gautam Buddha gave humanity the greatest management lesson.
Non-violence was integral to his worldview.
The message and teachings of Gautama Buddha resonate loudly and clearly with the major themes chosen for this symposium– the themes of avoiding conflicts, moving towards environmental consciousness and a concept of free and frank dialogue.
The three themes may appear independent but they are not mutually exclusive.
Infact, they are mutually dependent and supportive.
The conflict in the first theme is among humans, religions, communities and nation-states, also between non-state actors and states, and even the world.
Ethical values of personal restraint in consumption and environmental consciousness are deeply rooted in Asian philosophical traditions, especially in Hinduism and Buddhism.
Buddhism, along with other faiths, such as Confucianism, Taoism and Shintoism, has undertaken greater responsibility to protect the environment.
Hinduism and Buddhism with their well-defined treatises on Mother Earth can help examine the changes in approach that need to be made.
Climate change is a pressing global challenge.
In India, faith and Nature have had a deep link since ancient times.
Buddhism and environment are deeply co-related.
The impurities in the environment affect the mind, and the impurities of mind also pollute the environment.
In order to purify the environment, we have to purify the mind.
The eco crisis, in fact, is a reflection of imbalance of mind.
The nature, forests, trees and the well-being of all beings play a great role in the teachings of Lord Buddha.
In my book I have shared my experiences of dealing with climate change as the Chief Minister.
Again I repeat is not the issue of climate change, it is about climate justice.
In my view, the most adversely affected by climate change are the poor and the downtrodden.
We can’t let climate change keep affecting people in this manner.
Which is why I believe the discourse must shift focus from climate change to climate justice.
The third theme — promotion of dialogue – calls for a shift from ideological approach to a philosophic one.
Without proper dialogue, neither of the two themes of conflict avoidance is possible, or workable.
The severe limitations in our conflict resolution mechanisms are becoming more and more obvious.
We need significant, collective and strategic efforts to prevent bloodshed and violence.
It is, thus, no surprise that the world is taking note of Buddhism.
It is necessary to inform the world about the need to shift from ideology — whether religious or secular — to philosophy.
When I spoke at the Unite Nations last year, I briefly mentioned that the world needs to shift from ideological approach to philosophic approach.
So philosophy not only allows dialogue but it is perpetual search of truth through dialogue.
The entire Upanishad literature is a compilation of dialogue.
Ideology only believes in unabated truth.
It is my firm belief that the solution to all problems lies in dialogue.
Earlier, it was believed that force indicates power.
Now, power must come through the strength of ideas and the effective dialogue.
We have seen the adverse effects of war.
The first half of the 20th century was witness to the horrors of two world wars.
Now, nature of warfare is changing and the dangers are increasing.
What took a hundred thousand men or a prolonged battle can now happen through the click of a button, in a span of minutes.
All of us here have a cardinal duty to ensure that our future generations lead a life of peace, dignity and mutual respect.
It is worth recalling and describing this ancient example for our modern times.
This was how, in ancient India, debates on sensitive issues between scholars avoided such issues being settled in streets.
But the more important point is not the debate itself but how was the debate was conducted.
It is a fascinating story that will ever remain one of the highest forms of debate for all times for humanity.
Anger within is a sign of defeat.
On this logic, Mandana Mishra was declared as having lost the debate!
And he accepted sanyas and became a disciple of Sankara.
This demonstrates the vitality of dialogue and that too dialogue without anger or conflict.
Buddhism and Buddhist heritage have been a uniting and binding factor.
They say that this century is going to be an Asian Century .
I am very clear that without embracing the path and ideals shown by Gautam Buddha, this century cannot be an Asian century!
I see Lord Buddha doing to our collective spiritual well-being what global trade did to our collective economic well-being and the digital internet did to our collective intellectual well-being.
My Government is doing everything possible to give an impetus to this Buddhist heritage across India, and India is taking the lead in boosting the Buddhist heritage across Asia.
This three-day meet is one such effort.

To flag off first ever Diesel to Electric Converted Locomotive
Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone of Guru Ravidas Birth Place Development Project at Shri Guru Ravidas Janmasthan Temple, Seergoverdhanpur.
He will pay homage at the statue of Shri Guru Ravidas.
He will unveil the statue of Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya and murals of Varanasi Ghats in BHU.
The Prime Minister remarked that the city of Varanasi, which had for long, given the light of knowledge (Gyaan Prakash) to India was now symbolically giving the light of energy (Urja Prakash) to India, as IPDS was being launched nationwide today from Varanasi.
The Prime Minister said the youth of Varanasi, including women, had responded to his call of Swachh Bharat, and it was beginning to reflect on the Ghats of the city.
His impeccable service to the nation will be remembered by generations.
Deeply saddened by his demise.
Condolences to his family and supporters.
It is expected to add value to overseas mutual cooperation and regulation activities of SEBI and CMA, Kuwait.
This session begins with the address of the President.
However, despite the orders of the Supreme Court, the bill on triple talaq could not be passed by the Parliament.
Budget Session is very important.
Entire global community is very much optimistic about the Indian economy.
This Budget will provide a new energy to the fast growing economy of the country.
It will be fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the common man.
A month after the Budget session, various committees deliberate upon the details of the Budget proposals.
The past experience shows that in those deliberations the national interest is above the political interests.
Cutting across party line even the MPs from the ruling party highlights its short comings while the members of opposition highlight its salient feature.
In a way it provides for a healthy environment and atmosphere for debate and discussion.
In the all party meeting yesterday I have urged that we should take maximum help of the debate in the committees and to ensure that how we can ensure that the common man is benefited most from the Budget.
Our objective should be to reach out to the dalits, oppressed, underprivileged and to those who did not have any access to these benefits.
We also need to see how the villagers, poor, farmers and laborers are benefited maximum from the Budget.
Let’s have a detailed discussion, come out with positive suggestions and make a road map to march ahead.
In less than three years, it has in its fold, 87 members.
And a committed capital stock of 100 billion US Dollars.
It is poised to play a critical role in Asia.
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a result of collaborative efforts of Asian countries to provide a better tomorrow to our people.
One of them is to find resources for provision of infrastructure.
I am happy that the theme of this year’s Meeting is “Mobilizing Finance for Infrastructure: Innovation and Collaboration”.
Asia still faces wide ranging disparities in access to education, healthcare, financial services and formal employment opportunities.
Sectors such as energy and power, transportation, telecom, rural infrastructure, agriculture development, water supply and sanitation, environment protection, urban development, and logistics require long term funds.
The interest rates on these funds need to be affordable and sustainable.
In a short period, AIIB has approved 25 projects in a dozen countries with a total financing of over 4 billion US Dollars.
With committed capital of 100 billion dollars and huge need for infrastructure in member countries, I take this opportunity to call upon AIIB to expand from financing 4 billion dollars, to 40 billion dollars by 2020 and 100 billion dollars by 2025.
This would require simpler processing, and faster approval.
It would also need high quality projects and robust project proposals.
I believe that India and AIIB are both strongly committed to making economic growth more inclusive and sustainable.
In India, we are applying novel Public Private Partnership models, Infrastructure Debt Funds, and Infrastructure Investment Trusts to fund infrastructure.
India is trying to develop brownfield assets as a separate asset class for infrastructure investment.
Such assets, having passed the stages of land acquisition and environment and forest clearances, are relatively de-risked.
Hence, for such assets, institutional investment from pension, insurance and sovereign wealth funds are likely to be more forthcoming.
Another initiative, is the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
This aims to channel investments from both domestic and international sources into infrastructure.
This Fund has received a boost with AIIB committing 200 million US Dollars for investment.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
On each of these parameters, India is well placed and has performed very well.
Let me share with you, some of our experiences and achievements.
With a size of 2.8 trillion US Dollars, it is the seventh largest in the world.
Our macro-economic fundamentals are strong with stable prices, a robust external sector and a fiscal situation firmly in control.
We have simplified rules and regulations for businesses and undertaken bold reforms.

President Hollande, Excellencies, industry leaders,
To my long cherished dream of an international alliance of solar-rich countries, President Hollande responded with keen interest and immediate and full offer of support.
This is the inaugural day of a defining global conference on climate change.
For his support at every step, and his decision to co-chair the launch, I am deeply grateful.
Just as positive was his response to the idea of a book of quotations on Nature from the world to remind us all of our timeless wisdom.
I am honoured to co-author the preface with him.
Since ancient times, different civilizations have given a special place to Sun.
In the Indian tradition, Sun is the source of all forms of energy.
As Rig Veda says, Sun God is the Soul of all beings, moving and non-moving.
Many in India begin their day with a prayer to the Sun.
Today, when the energy sources and excesses of our industrial age have put our planet in peril, the world must turn to Sun to power our future.
As the developing world lift billions of people into prosperity, our hope for a sustainable planet rests on a bold global initiative.
It will mean advanced countries leaving enough carbon space for developing countries to grow.
The vast majority of humanity is blessed with generous sunlight round the year.
Yet, many are also without any source of power.
This is why this alliance is so important.
We want to bring solar energy into our lives and homes, by making it cheaper, more reliable and easier to connect to grid.
We will collaborate on research and innovation.
We will share knowledge and exchange best practices.
We will cooperate on training and building institutions.
We will discuss regulatory issues and promote common standards.
We will attract investments in the solar sector, encourage joint ventures and develop innovative financing mechanisms.
We will partner with other international initiatives on renewable energy.
There is already a revolution in solar energy.
By the end of next year, we would have added another 12 GW.
I am delighted with the industry response.
This is an alliance that brings together developed and developing countries, governments and industries, laboratories and institutions, in a common enterprise.
India will be pleased to host this initiative at the premises of our National Institute of Solar Energy.

3. Farmers are at a risk of not getting appropriate price for their produce during the surplus production phase.
Taking this into account, the Policy allows use of surplus food grains for production of ethanol for blending with petrol with the approval of National Biofuel Coordination Committee.
6. Roles and responsibilities of all the concerned Ministries/Departments with respect to biofuels has been captured in the Policy document to synergise efforts.
Expected Benefits:
• Reduce Import Dependency: One crore lit of E10 saves Rs.28 crore of forex at current rates.
• Cleaner Environment: One crore lit of E-10 saves around 20,000 ton of CO2 emissions.
For the ethanol supply year 2017-18, there will be lesser emissions of CO2 to the tune of 30 lakh ton.
By reducing crop burning & conversion of agricultural residues/wastes to biofuels there will be further reduction in Green House Gas emissions.
• Health benefits: Prolonged reuse of Cooking Oil for preparing food, particularly in deep-frying is a potential health hazard and can lead to many diseases.
Used Cooking Oil is a potential feedstock for biodiesel and its use for making biodiesel will prevent diversion of used cooking oil in the food industry.
• MSW Management: It is estimated that, annually 62 MMT of Municipal Solid Waste gets generated in India.
There are technologies available which can convert waste/plastic, MSW to drop in fuels.
One ton of such waste has the potential to provide around 20% of drop in fuels.
• Infrastructural Investment in Rural Areas: It is estimated that, one 100klpd bio refinery will require around Rs.800 crore capital investment.
At present Oil Marketing Companies are in the process of setting up twelve 2G bio refineries with an investment of around Rs.10,000 crore.
Further addition of 2G bio refineries across the Country will spur infrastructural investment in the rural areas.
The MoU is expected to take forward information exchange on policies, programmes and technologies relating to enhanced energy efficiency and demand side management.
The MoU will lead to awareness creation on energy efficiency.
Development of tools for collection, use and analysis of CO2 emissions and GHG data for tracking global emissions for INDC.
It will promote Research and Development, and demonstration of energy efficient technologies.
Development of sustainable mobility with specific focus on electric transport.

Prime Minister: My Beloved 125 Crore countrymen of India,
My best wishes and heartiest greetings on the occasion of this sacred festival of our Freedom.
This morning of the 15th of August is not a usual morning.
This is the dawn of the freedom-festival of the greatest democracy of the world.
Recently many distinguished citizens of India, youths, literary artists and social workers- sons and daughters of Mother India- have achieved many great feats to make our country proud.
They are countless in number and from the ramparts of Red fort I extend my best wishes and greetings to all of them from the core of my heart.
Our unity, simplicity, fraternity, harmony are our biggest strength.
This strength should never be blemished, it should never be hit.
People’s participation is the biggest strength of democracy.
If we run the country through the participation of One Hundred and twenty five crore Indians, our country will be moving ahead one hundred and twenty five crore steps every moment.
We should support the poor in their fight against poverty and empower them in this arduous effort of theirs because no one wants to remain poor and they also wish to get rid of poverty.
At that time I was new, whatever I saw in the government, I expressed them with an open mind before one hundred and twenty five crore citizens.
Today after one year, standing under the Tricolor from the same ramparts of the Red Fort , I assure the countrymen that in this period of one year our “Team India”, consisting of one hundred and twenty five crore people, is committed to realize our dreams within the timeframe with new hope, new energy and utmost hard work.
An atmosphere of trust has emerged.
I had announced ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna’ on the last 15th of August.
My countrymen, today I can proudly say that we achieved that target within the time frame.
17 Crore people opened their bank accounts under ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna’.
It could be possible only due to richness of our poor citizens.
This is so because in the past 60 years, we have measured the development of the country only on the basis of these parameters.
I disagree with this thought.
In a country like India, if we look at the pyramid of development, its base is the broadest.
If it be firm, the entire pyramid of development tends to be strong.
Today the downtrodden, the exploited, oppressed, deprived, and the ignored ones of our country form the base of the pyramid of development.
And when the purchasing power of the poorest of the poor in the society increases, nobody can stop that economy to flourish and move ahead.
Crores of the people of our country have no social security cover.
Leave the poor aside, benefit of insurance has not reached even the lower middle class.
If your family faces any calamity then they will receive 2 lac rupees.
We know how to manage an economy !
That’s why we launched Prime Minister’s Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana for 90 paisa a day, even less than 1 rupee.
So it is Rs. 330 annually for the health of one’s family – and for the security of one’s family- insurance of 2 lac rupees.
This is what we have done.
But the touchstone is whether we walk the talk or not.
We have laid a great stress upon a new work culture.
Dear Countrymen, our Nation has many schemes which are 40 years old or 50years old but these schemes could not reach more than 5 or 7 crore people.
Ten crore citizens of this country means ten crore families.
And this means that out of total 30-35 crore families of our country, ten crore families have joined this scheme within a span of hundred days.
Last year I referred to toilet facilities for all from this Red Fort, I also referred to cleanliness.
It sounded strange to the whole country for a few hours as to what sort of Prime Minister is this!
But today in all the surveys that has been carried out in the entire country, this point has come out in all of them that if there is something that is the most important factor of “Team India” and that has touched every person, is the movement towards cleanliness.
The success of this programme is due to those little children.
I wish to bow my head towards the future of my country, I wish to bow my head and greet those children.
The fact which is not realized even by the elite people has been easily understood by the innocent children and it is my belief that such a country where a child is so much aware, so committed towards cleanliness, such country is bound to become clean; Abhorrence against filth and dirt is bound to arise there.
There cannot be a greater tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary.
I had announced it without consulting anybody.
It was not announced after collecting relevant information from districts and villages.
It just came into my heart and I had announced that we would build separate toilets for boys and girls in all of our schools till the next 15th August.
But later on, when we started work, the “Team India” figured out its responsibilities, we realised that there were 2 lakh and 62 thousand such schools, where more than 4.25 lakh toilets were required to be built.
I compliment to all the state governments, government officers of the districts, policy framers and implementers of educational institutions, who were involved in realising this achievement.
This is not just an issue of building more than 4.25 lakh toilets.
Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, we have prepared a plan for the labourers of our country, and it has been named as “SHRAMEVA JAYATE”.
Our attitude towards the poor labourers is not good.
If we meet a person wearing coat, pants, tie or we meet a great person wearing long kurta, jacket we salute him by standing in his honour.
But if an auto rickshaw driver, pedal rickshaw puller, newspaper vendor or a milkman come to us, our feelings towards these poor men are not proper.
One hundred and twenty five crore citizens of the country have to remove this deficiency of the Nation by their resolution of mind.
Recently, we started a campaign of issuing special identity card to the unorganized labour falling under certain schemes.
They are to get the benefits of many schemes of security through that identity card.
These unorganized labourers were never taken care of.
Similarly, labourers of our country had deposited their share of hard earned money in Government coffers.
We found a solution to it.
One law may contradict the other but the law should be on the same subject.
Confusion was being created here always.
Where will a poor labourer look for his thing of interest in the pile-up of different types of 44 legislations meant for our labourers?
We have brought about a change therein.
After so many of years of efforts, we get rid of termite.
If I had said that I would cut subsidy worth Rs. 15 thousand cores on LPG gas, then I can say that hundreds of articles would have been written to glorify my Government.
They have this habit.
I can see that there are some people who always search for negativism, propagate negativism and they enjoy it as much as they can.
We have put in place a scheme of Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG subsidy.
Taking advantage of Jan Dhan Accounts and Adhaar Card we have transferred the subsidy directly into the accounts.
As a result of this the brokers, the middlemen and the blackmarketeers have disappeared.
Only the real beneficiary got the benefit.
This is not a small figure.
Even if we are in the queue before a temple for the blessings (Prasaad), we sometimes wish that we should get some of the prasad for our younger brother also.
This is in our nature.
These 20 lakh people are not from rich or wealthy families.
They are all from the common middle class.
Some teacher may have been a pensioner, but when he learnt that this LPG cylinder may go to some poor person, he gave up his subsidy.
Just think of the relief and happiness of the little children who had been crying due to the smoke!
This is not a place for politicking, so I would like to urge upon all the political pundits that in this case, the kind of coal issue that I am going to raise, may please not be judged through the political angle.
This is the requirement of our Nation’s resolve.
CAG said that when coal blocks were allocated through lottery, the Nation lost Rs.1 lakh and 74 thousand crores.
We also used this statistics in the election-speeches.
Nevertheless, we sometimes thought that this much of loss may not have been there.
But we went on saying like that.
Later we decided that whether it be coal, or spectrum or any other mineral, all will be auctioned henceforth.
The same thing happened in the case of spectrum.
Why are you putting even FM on auction?
The day before when I enquired, the auction amount had crossed Rs. one thousand crores.
This money is going to be used for the poor people.
Brothers and sisters, what a run the country had at the hands of its leadership, how it was looted, what impact was put on the policies!
What kind of an activity it was that continued in the country?
Now, even a small child in this country can understand as to how the goods can be utilized for the place where they are situated instead of going for their transport from that place to the other.
Brothers and sisters, we changed that decision.
Corruption in a way has become part of the system.
Until it is stamped out from the system, dear brothers and sisters, I’ll keep suffering every atrocity, facing every obstacle but with your blessings I shall fulfill the dream of a corruption free India.
I say this to you from the ramparts of the Red Fort with the tricolour as my witness and the understanding of the dreams of the 125 crore people.
This Government does not have any allegation of corruption against it for even a single penny.
But I had said alongside that it was like the pests, the termite.
This much has been achieved, whether someone believes it or not.
Not only this, we have given some grace period for declaring undisclosed income and today I can say that people have come forward and declared their undisclosed income amounting to Rs. 6500 crores.
This amount will accrue to our exchequer.
It will benefit the poor of India.
We are still new in power but we have already registered eighteen hundred cases since we took charge; we have taken action against government employees.
It shows our ability to fight corruption.
In 2005, a law namely ‘PMLA’ was framed in our country.
We have endeavored to change systems.
One will have to admit the fact that before us, the inflation was in double digits.
We have decided to pump in fifty thousand crore rupees in ‘Pradhaan Mantri Krishi Sinchaai Yojna’.
We have moved in the direction of spending funds to take this cause further.
Such an increase has never been witnessed in the past 60 years.
Not only this, earlier if there were any losses, there was the norm according to which one would be entitled for compensation only if the losses suffered were at least 50 per cent.
We have brought it down to 30 per cent.
Never in the past 60 years was such a great initiative of helping the farmers taken.
Farmers need urea.
I would like to tell once again as to how to fight corruption.
“Neem-Coating” is not the brain child of Modi, rather it is an idea propounded by Scientists and this idea has not only been brought before my government, it has come before previous governments as well.
Therefore, irrespective of the burden caused to the exchequer, we have accomplished the task of doing hundred per cent “Neem-Coating” of urea.
As a result of this, now urea cannot be used for any purpose other than farming.
Now, no chemical factory can indulge in any kind of pilferage of urea.
India cannot be said to be developing only on the basis of the development of the western parts of the country.
India will move ahead only when our eastern Uttar Pradesh becomes prosperous, our Bihar becomes strong, our West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, North Eastern regions tread the path of development.
These territories of India should become powerful.
Who could have thought that the states where there was no potable tap water even in kitchen, there we are working to supply the gas through pipe lines.
If we will keep on following the old methods, perhaps it will take ten more years to electrify these eighteen thousand, five hundred villages with wires and polls.
The country is not ready to wait for ten years.
I took the meeting of government officials and enquired from them about the timeline.
Someone promised to complete the task till 2019, someone assured to complete it till 2022.
Some were hesitant due to dense forests or snowy hills, and some had apprehension due to inaccessibility of certain areas.
I urge upon the states to come forward and accept this challenge.
This is not pending in every state, only a few states will have to strive a little further.
I would not like to count the name of such states, as it would be viewed politically and may attract political comments.
Hence, it’s better to avoid it.
I, therefore, announce the pledge of the ‘Team India’ of our 1.25 billion countrymen, from the Red Fort, that electricity would be made available to 18,500 villages within the next 1000 days, with the help of states and local bodies.
I have taken up another issue of concern, which is ‘Welfare of Farmers’.
Similar issue of grave concern is the under-development of such mining areas, from where we get mineral resources, such as coal, bauxite and other minerals.
How our youths become new entrepreneurs, how our youths become new producers, how a complete network of start-up by these new entrepreneurs is set up in the whole country?
There should not be any district, any block in Hindustan where there are not start-up initiated in the coming days.
Whether India cannot dream that India becomes number one in the world of start-up.
Today we are not at that position.
These one lakh twenty five thousand branches should promote start-up of women entrepreneurs and help them financially.
It has its own significance and this should continue.
The Government would now formulate new schemes for new units linking it with employment and assistance of Government.
We want to stress upon the growth of employment opportunities in the country.
We have reached far beyond in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of skill India and digital India.
I have not seen any such psychologist till now, who are capable of assessing a person on the basis of interviewing him just for two minutes.
I have to combat this problem.
This would help in curbing corruption, which hurts the poor people, and it would ease out their problem.
It is my appeal to endeavour towards this goal.
My countrymen enjoy sound sleep.
But, if our 1.25 billion countrymen are able to enjoy their undisturbed sleep, it is only due to ever-readiness of our jawans to sacrifice themselves, who are posted at the borders.
No country can under-evaluate the importance of its armed forces.
Thereafter, NRHM and NUHM became two sub-missions under the overarching NHM.
Cabinet noted the progress under NHM including accelerated decline in MMR, IMR, U5MR and TFR.
It has been brought down to 94 blocks in 2016.
Percentage annual rate of decline during 2010-2015 has accelerated to 6.1% from 3.7% observed during 1990-2010.
Annual rate of decline in 2014-15 was 4.4%.
• Filariasis – Till 31st March 2017, 94 districts achieved <1% Mf rate out of 256 endemic districts which was validated by Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) and successfully stopped Mass Drug Administration (MDA).
While NRHM was launched in April 2005, launch of NUHM was approved by the Cabinet on 1stMay 2013.
NHM envisages achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable & quality healthcare services that are accountable and responsive to people’s needs.
Till 31st March 2017, 3.32 crore children were vaccinated in MR vaccination campaign in these States.
A total of 528 districts were covered in the four phases of Mission Indradhanush.
During the three phases and ongoing fourth phase of Mission Indradhanush, as on 31st March’ 2017, around 2.11 crore children were reached of which 55 lakhs children were fully immunized.
• Support provided to States for provision of free drugs and setting up of systems for drug procurement, quality assurance, IT based supply chain management system, training and grievance redressal etc.

The Cabinet approval further stipulates that exercise of these delegated powers would be subject to the condition that a progress report regarding N(R)HM, along with deviation in financial norms, modifications in ongoing schemes and details of new schemes be placed before the Cabinet for information on an annual basis.
Sharing his sentiments in a series of tweets the Prime Minister observed that the outcome of Paris Agreement has no winners or losers.
“Deliberations at COP21 and Paris Agreement demonstrates the collective wisdom of world leaders to mitigate climate change.
Climate change remains a challenge but Paris Agreement demonstrates how every nation rose to the challenge, working towards a solution.
He will address three public meetings in the course of the day.
He will begin his visit to the State by offering prayers at the Shri Manjunatha Swamy Temple at Dharmasthala.
He will address a public meeting, and distribute RuPay cards to beneficiaries at the Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project, at Ujire.
This will enable the Self Help Groups to begin cashless digital transactions.
The Prime Minister will then travel to Bengaluru, where he will address the gathering at the Dashamah Soundarya Lahari Parayanotsava Mahasarmapane.
The event has been organized for the mass chanting of these shlokas in unison.
Later in the day, at Bidar, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the Bidar – Kalaburagi New Railway Line.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to proposal for dissolution of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited (CIWTC).
CIWTC, a company incorporated on 22nd February 1967 under the Companies Act 1956 by the Government of India, when it took over the assets and liabilities of the erstwhile River Steam Navigation Company Limited under a scheme approved by the Calcutta High Court.
Due to inherent limitation and infrastructure bottle necks, the operations of CIWTC could never become viable and company has been incurring losses since inception.
The Company has only five employees at present.
In line with the decision of the Government to revitalize sick CPSUs wherever possible or to wind up irretrievable cases, the dissolution of the CIWTC would be initiated after disposal of movable and immovable assets.
This would free up the assets for better utilization and for the benefit of the people.
A number of assets would be taken up by Inland Waterways Authority of India to provide services on Brahmputra River (NW-4).
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, was apprised about an MoU signed in February, 2019 between India and Argentine on Antarctic cooperation.

This is the third place in Haryana, after Gurugram and Faridabad to be connected like this.
The Metro will make this more convenient, he added.
He said the Metro will mean more employment opportunities for the people in the area.
The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has brought out a policy relating to Metros, to bring uniformity and standardization in metro rail networks across the country.
Wherever Metros are being built in India, the Centre and the respective State Governments are working together, he added.
Noting that New India requires new and smart infrastructure, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government is working on roads, railways, highways, airways, waterways and i-ways.
There is focus on connectivity and on ensuring that development projects are completed on time, he added.
I am pleased to be here today to mark twenty years of Bloomberg’s presence in India.
During that period, Bloomberg has provided intelligent commentary and incisive analysis of India’s economy.
It has become an essential part of the finance landscape.
As Mayor of one of the world’s great cities, Mr. Bloomberg has personal insight into what makes a city tick.
His ideas have enriched the design of our Smart Cities programme.
Under this programme, we hope to create one hundred cities which will become role models for urban development throughout the country.
The world expects much from India, in terms of contributing to global growth.
To the extent that time permits, I would like to place before you my thoughts on how India intends to meet the challenge.
I will touch upon three major areas.
Thirdly, I will elaborate on an aspect of economic development which is of particular importance to me, namely job creation.
Experts are unanimous that India is one of the world economy’s brightest spots.
We have low inflation, a low balance of payments current account deficit, and a high rate of growth.
This was a steeper fall than between 2014 and 2015.
Yet in 2009-10, India’s fiscal deficit, its current account deficit and its inflation rate, all got substantially worse.
And this slid was from a higher base figure for all three.
But in 2015-16, all three have improved, from a lower base.
• Many other emerging economies also depend on imported oil.
If oil prices were the driver of success, those countries would all be showing similar results.
But they are not.
• We have not been lucky with global trade or growth.
For India to be at the top of global growth tables is an unusual situation.
Obviously, there are some who find that difficult to digest and come up with imaginative and fanciful ideas to belittle that achievement.
The fact is that India’s economic success is the hard-won result of prudence, sound policy and effective management.
We have met ambitious fiscal targets in each of the previous two fiscal years.
We have reduced the deficit even while increasing capital expenditure.
And the reduction has come despite an unprecedented steep cut in the Centre’s share of tax revenues, in the award of the fourteenth Finance Commission.
For 2016-17, we have targeted a fiscal deficit of 3.5 per cent of GDP.
This will be the second lowest level in the last 40 years.
Our growth rate is acknowledged as the highest among major economies.
There are some who remain confused and have said that the growth rate does not ‘feel’ right.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance to them in reducing the confusion, by stating facts in place of feelings.
Let us first look at credit.
There has been a smart pick-up in credit growth after September 2015.
Credit off-take between February 2015 and February 2016 increased by 11.5 per cent.
The overall fund flow to the corporate sector through equity and borrowings of various kinds, domestic and foreign, has increased in the first three quarters of 2015-16 by over 30 per cent.
There are some very interesting figures on credit ratings.
In 2013 and 2014, the number of firms whose credit rating was downgraded was much higher than those who were upgraded.
That has now changed decisively.
Upgrades are up and downgrades are down.
These are sectors that are closely connected with the rural economy.
I am thrilled to see that foreign investment is flowing into them.
In the year to September 2015, FDI in construction activities showed 316 per cent growth.
This is concrete evidence that the Make in India policy is having effect in employment intensive sectors.
In a difficult global environment for exports, manufacturing output has fluctuated.
However, several key sub-sectors of manufacturing are growing rapidly.
Looking towards the future, let me turn to agriculture.
In the past, the emphasis has been on agricultural output, rather than on farmers’ incomes.
I have set the objective of doubling farmers’ income by 2022.
I have laid this out as a challenge, but it is not merely a challenge.
With a good strategy, well-designed programmes, adequate resources and good governance in implementation, this target is achievable.
And, as a large share of our population depends on agriculture, a doubling of farmers’ incomes will have strong benefits for other sectors of the economy.
Let me outline our strategy.
• Second, we are focusing on provision of quality seeds and on efficiency of nutrient use.
The provision of soil health cards enables accurate selection of inputs according to the requirements of each field.
These will lower costs of production and increase net income.
• Third, a large portion of the harvest is lost before it reaches the consumer.
We have greatly increased the outlay for agricultural infrastructure.
• Fourth, we are promoting value addition through food processing.
As an example, in response to a call from me, Coca Cola has recently started adding fruit juice to some of its aerated drinks.
• Fifth, we are creating a national agricultural market and removing distortions.
A common electronic market platform is being introduced across 585 regulated wholesale markets.
The introduction of FDI in marketing of domestic food products in this budget is with the same objective.
• Sixth, we have introduced the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.
• Seventh, we will increase income from ancillary activities.
Partly this will be through poultry, honey bees, farm ponds and fisheries.
He wrote to me after the budget expressing gratitude for the farmer-centric budget.
Seeds have been sown for agricultural transformation and for attracting and retaining youth in farming.
The dawn of a new era in farming is in sight.”
Let me now turn to some of the programmes and policies that underpin our growth.
Let me start with administrative reforms and our focus on execution.
In a country like India, resources are scarce, while problems are abundant.
An intelligent strategy is to optimize use of resources through efficiency in implementation.
Mere announcement of policies, or so-called policies, achieves little.
Even more than reformed policies, we need transformed execution.
Let me illustrate.
The National Food Security Act was passed in 2013 but remained without implementation in most states.
In the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, much of the expenditure was leaking out to touts, middlemen and the non-poor, though expenditure was recorded in the books.
We are now implementing the Food Security Act nationwide.
We have drastically reduced leakages in the Employment Guarantee scheme and ensured that money reaches those for whom it is intended.
Our record on implementation in general, and reduction in corruption in particular, is now well understood.
So I will be brief.
Coal, minerals and spectrum have been auctioned transparently raising large amounts.
We have launched a number of new programmes across various sectors.
Many legacy issues have been solved.
The number of stalled projects has declined.
Let me now turn to policy reforms.
I have referred to the durable reduction in inflation since this Government took office.
This is partly attributable to bold measures taken to strengthen monetary policy.
Last year, we entered into a Monetary Framework Agreement with the Reserve Bank of India.
This year we have introduced in the Finance Bill, amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act.
The committee will have no members from the Government.
Through this reform, monetary policy will acquire an inflation focus and a level of institutional autonomy unprecedented in major emerging markets, and greater than several developed countries.
Together with our adherence to the path of fiscal consolidation, this is a testimony to our strong commitment to macro-economic prudence and stability.
Another major policy reform is in the petroleum sector.
Along with the passing of this long pending bill, we have introduced tax incentives for developers and buyers of housing for the neo-middle class and the poor.
The UDAY scheme in the power sector has permanently changed the incentive structure for State Governments.
Ambitious operational targets are backed by credible incentives to perform.
This imposes a hard budget constraint on the states.
It creates a powerful incentive for states to manage the electricity sector efficiently.
Already nine states accounting for over forty per cent of the total debt of distribution companies, have entered into Memoranda of Understanding with the Central Government.
Another nine have agreed to do so.
You are probably aware of this government’s sweeping policy reforms in renewable energy.
From an average of less than 1500 Megawatts of solar capacity addition per annum, we are moving up to 10,000 Megawatts per annum.
When I announced a target of 175 Gigawatts of renewables, as a pillar of our climate change strategy, many were surprised and some were skeptical.
Yet, this month the International Energy Agency has reported that a surge in renewables has already halted global growth in energy-related carbon emissions.
Parliament has recently passed a new law on inland waterways which will enable the rapid development of this efficient mode of transport.
This will increase the number of navigable waterways from 5 to 106.
These reforms are already bearing fruit.
We have enhanced the limits for foreign investment in stock exchanges and allowed them to be listed.
I am sure, you are aware, of the reforms we have undertaken to promote private equity venture capital, and an eco-system for start-ups.
I note that this ‘new economy’ is the focus of your panel discussions.
In a reform to eliminate corruption in government recruitments, we have abolished interviews for lower and middle level positions.
I am happy to announce one more measure to improve the labour market and benefit the unemployed.
The Government and Public Sector Undertakings conduct a number of recruitment examinations.
So far, the scores in these examinations have been retained by the Government.
Hereafter, we will make available the results and the candidate information openly to all employers, wherever consent is given by the candidate.
You may be aware of the spectacular progress of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Over 31 million loans have been sanctioned to entrepreneurs for a total value of nearly 19 billion dollars this year.
Even if we assume conservatively that on average, each enterprise creates just one sustainable job, this initiative itself amounts to 31 million in new employment.
The Stand-Up India scheme will also provide 250,000 entrepreneurship loans to women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
My government’s measures on skill development are well known.
Our aim is to empower higher educational institutions to help them attain the highest standards.
To start with, we will provide an enabling regulatory architecture to ten public and ten private institutions, so that they emerge as world-class teaching and research institutions.
Their regulatory framework will be separate from existing structures like the University Grants Commission and All India Council for Technical Education.
They will have complete autonomy on academic, administrative and financial matters.
We will provide additional resources for the next five years for the ten public universities.
This will eventually allow ordinary Indians affordable access to world-class degree courses.
This initiative is the beginning of a journey to restore the original mandate of higher education regulators.
They should be facilitators and guides, driven by norms of self-disclosure and transparency, instead of top-down command and control.
Eventually, through regulatory reform, we aspire to world-class standards in all colleges and universities.
Another initiative is in school education.
We have achieved much quantitative progress in access and pupil-teacher ratios.
The foundation of today’s knowledge economy is the quality of its school leavers.
We have now decided that the quality of learning outcomes will be the Government’s primary objective.
Accordingly, we will allocate an increasing share of resources under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan to quality.
These funds will be used to promote local initiatives and innovations to improve learning outcomes.
I am sure, all of you who are parents and all of you who are employers, will welcome these steps in higher and school education respectively.
In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have initiated many steps.
Many more lie ahead.
Some have begun bearing fruit.
What we have achieved so far, gives me the confidence that, with the support of the people, we can transform India.
I know it will be difficult.
But I am sure it is do-able.
And I am confident, it will be done.

Important milestone in the declassification of Netaji files
The Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Shri Nripendra Misra, today officially handed over the first set of files related to Netaji to the Director General, National Archives of India, setting the stage for their declassification beginning on 23rd January, 2016.
He had assured Netaji’s family that all possible effort towards the same would be made, from the declassification of Netaji files to taking up the matter with other nations.
He had further promised that the declassification and public release of the files would begin on 23rd January, 2016, the Birth Anniversary of Netaji.
Working towards this commitment, the government has been undertaking the process of due diligence stipulated under declassification procedures and guidelines.
As a part of the same, the first batch of 33 PMO files have been cleared, and were handed over to the National Archives of India today for further processing, preservation and digitization, in preparation for the final release to the nation of all 58 files in the PMO.

The interaction covered the beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana – ‘Saubhagya’ scheme, through video bridge.
This is the tenth interaction in the series by the Prime Minister through video conference with the beneficiaries of various Government schemes.
Expressing delight in interacting with the villagers from the recently electrified 18000 villages, Prime Minister said “People who have not seen darkness, don’t understand the meaning of illumination.
He added that unlike the false promises given by the previous government, the present government has walked the talk of electrifying every village.
The Government not only focused on electrification, but also reformed the distribution systems across the country, Prime Minister added.
Narendra Modi said that it was difficult to electrify the last 18000 villages, as most were in remote areas, hilly areas and areas with poor connectivity.
He added that despite all the difficulties, a dedicated team of people worked hard to ensure that the dream of electrifying every village is achieved.
He added that the Government accords priority to the development of Eastern India and with complete electrification, now Eastern India can play an even bigger role in India’s development journey.
Prime Minister said that Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana has been started with the objective of electrifying each and every house in the country.
More than 86 lakh household has been electrified through theYojana so far.
The Yojana is in mission mode and will ensure electric connection to around four crore households.

Your Excellency, President Ramaphosa, Distinguished guests who came here from South Africa,
It is a matter of great pleasure for us that President Ramaphosa, an integral friend of India, is present among us today.
India is not new to him, but it is his first visit to India as the President.
And his visit to India is happening during a special moment in our relations.
This is the 150th birth anniversary year of Mahatma Gandhiji.
I am very happy that President Ramaphosa has come to India on this special occasion.
India is grateful for all this respect and pride they are giving us.
Whole India is grateful to him for allowing us this distinction.
I first met President Ramaphosa when I went to South Africa in 2016.
At that time, he was the Vice-President.
Though it is winter season in Delhi, but I believe that in this journey President Ramaphosa will also feel the warmth of India’s welcome.
I warmly welcome the President, and his delegation, in India.
During our interactions today with the President, we reviewed all the dimensions of our relations.
South Africa participated as the Partner Country in the “Vibrant Gujarat” summit held this year.
And Indian companies are taking active part in the efforts of President Ramaphosa to increase investment in South Africa.
The Gandhi-Mandela Skills Institute is set to be established soon in Pretoria.
And we both are committed to take these relationships to a new level.
And therefore, we will meet major business leaders of both the countries in a short while from now.
We are the successors to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
And therefore, the broad global outlook of both the countries is quite similar to each other.
A special part of the program of this visit of the President to India will be the first “Gandhi-Mandela Freedom Lecture” which is being organized today.
I, once again, warmly welcome the President.
There was a time when development was believed to depend on the quantity of capital and labour.
Today we know that it depends as much on the quality of institutions and ideas.
Early last year, a new institution was created, namely, the National Institution for Transforming India or NITI.
NITI was created as an evidence based think tank to guide India’s transformation.
One of NITI’s functions is:
– to mainstream external ideas into Government policies, through collaboration with national and international experts;
– to be the Government’s link to the outside world, outside experts and practitioners;
– to be the instrument through which ideas from outside are incorporated into policy-making.
The Government of India and the State Governments have a long administrative tradition.
This tradition combines indigenous and external ideas from India’s past.
This administrative tradition has served India well in many ways.
Above all, it has preserved democracy and federalism, unity and integrity, in a country of glorious diversity.
These are not small achievements.
Yet, we now live in an age where change is constant and we are variables.
We must change for both external and internal reasons.
Each country has its own experiences, its own resources and its own strengths.
Thirty years ago, a country might have been able to look inward and find its own solutions.
Today, countries are inter dependent and inter connected.
No country can afford any longer to develop in isolation.
Every country has to benchmark its activities to global standards, or else fall behind.
Change is also necessary for internal reasons.
Even in families, the relationship between the young and old has changed.
There was a time when elders in a family knew more than those who were younger.
Today, with the spread of new technology, the situation is often reversed.
This increases the challenge for government in communicating and in meeting rising expectations.
If India is to meet the challenge of change, mere incremental progress is not enough.
A metamorphosis is needed.
That is why my vision for India is rapid transformation, not gradual evolution.
• The transformation of India cannot happen without a transformation of governance.
• A transformation of governance cannot happen without a transformation in mindset.
• A transformation in mindset cannot happen without transformative ideas.
We have to change laws, eliminate unnecessary procedures, speed up processes and adopt technology.
We cannot march through the twenty first century with the administrative systems of the nineteenth century.
As individuals, we may absorb new ideas by reading books or articles.
Books open the windows of our minds.
However, unless we brainstorm collectively, ideas remain confined to individual minds.
We often hear of new ideas and understand them.
But we do not act upon them, because it is beyond our individual capacity.
If we sit together, we will have the collective force to convert ideas into action.
What we need is a collective opening of our minds, to let in new, global perspectives.
To do this, we have to absorb new ideas collectively rather than individually.
It requires a concerted effort.
As many of you know, ever since taking office, I have personally participated in structured brainstorming sessions with bankers, with police officers and with Secretaries to Government, among others.
The ideas coming from those sessions are being incorporated into policy.
These efforts have been to tap ideas from inside.
The next step is to bring in ideas from outside.
Culturally, Indians have always been receptive to ideas from elsewhere.
It is said in the Rigveda – “आ नो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः”, which means, let us welcome noble thoughts flowing in from all directions.
This is the purpose of the Transforming India Lecture Series.
It is a series which we will attend, not as individuals but as part of a team who can collectively make change happen.
We will draw the best from the wisdom and knowledge of eminent persons, who changed, or influenced change in the lives of many, to make their nation a better place in the planet.
This lecture will be the first in a series.
You have all been given a feedback form.
I look forward to your detailed and frank feedback to help us improve this process.
I request you to suggest names of experts and panelists from inside and outside India.
I also request all Secretaries to Government to conduct a follow up discussion in a week’s time, with the participants from their Ministries.
The purpose is to convert ideas that emerge in today’s session into specific action points relevant to each group.
Wherever possible, I request the Ministers also to participate in these sessions.
One of the greatest reformers and administrators of our time was Lee Kuan Yew, who transformed Singapore to what it is today.
He is a prolific scholar and public policy maker.
Apart from being Deputy Prime Minister, he is also the Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies, Minister of Finance and Chairman of Monetary Authority of Singapore.
At Harvard, he was honoured with the Littauer Fellow award for his outstanding performance.
Shri Shanmugaratnam is one of the world’s leading intellectuals.
I would like to give you an example of the range and sweep of his ideas.
Today, Singapore’s economy depends a lot on transshipment.
But if global warming melts the polar ice caps, new navigation routes may open and possibly reduce Singapore’s relevance.
The list of achievements and honours received by Shri Shanmugaratnam is long.
But we are all eager to listen to him.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in his Labour Day message, has saluted the determination and hard work of countless workers who play a big role in India’s progress.
“Today, on Labour Day we salute the determination and hard work of countless workers who play a big role in India’s progress.
Shrameva Jayate!”, the Prime Minister said.
The BIMSTEC National Security Chiefs appreciated the Prime Minister’s vision for BIMSTEC and thanked him for hosting the first ever meeting of the National Security Chiefs of the Member States in India.
The National Security Chiefs briefed the Prime Minister about their deliberations at the meeting.
Prime Minister Modi called upon the BIMSTEC Member States to come together to counter common security threats, such as terrorism; extremism and radicalization; drugs, arms and human trafficking; and natural disasters.
The Prime Minister also said that BIMSTEC Member States should also work together to address non-traditional security threats, such as in the domain of cyber security and in maritime domain.
Cabinet approves introduction of the “Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016”
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for introduction of the “Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016”.
The Bill will regulate surrogacy in India by establishing National Surrogacy Board at the central level and State Surrogacy Boards and Appropriate Authorities in the State and Union Territories.
The legislation will ensure effective regulation of surrogacy, prohibit commercial surrogacy and allow ethical surrogacy to the needy infertile couples.
All infertile Indian married couple who want to avail ethical surrogacy will be benefited.
Further the rights of surrogate mother and children born out of surrogacy will be protected.
The Bill shall apply to whole of India, except the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The major benefits of the Act would be that it will regulate the surrogacy services in the country.
The Prime Minister spoke of the goals such doubling farmers’ income by 2022, and balanced development in rural and urban areas.
He said the process needs to be reversed, to eliminate middlemen and help raise incomes.
The Prime Minister mentioned neem coating of urea, bee keeping, and sea-weed cultivation, as areas where the cooperative movement could contribute significantly.
He also gave away awards for cooperative excellence, on the occasion.
This programme is being attended by representatives from South Asia, Southeast Asia and all the East Asian countries.
I welcome all of you to this programme.
Friends, very few regions of the world have such intensive historical interfaces as this region has.
For thousands of years we have been connected by Trade, Culture and Religion.
The Coastal Economy has made significant contribution in connecting this region for centuries.
Movement of people from one place to another and exchange of thoughts and ideas, has been a two way process and has benefitted every country in this region.
Today, we all symbolise a shared heritage not only economically but also culturally.
Friends, in today’s modern era our traditional relationship has attained a new dimension.
The Asian countries are not only catering to the goods and services markets in their own country but their reach has expanded to other continents as well.
For the first time in 1985, the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection were framed.
They were revised two years ago.
India has also played an active role in the process of revision.
These guidelines are very important with regard to Sustainable Consumption, E-Commerce and Financial Services in developing countries.
Friends, consumer protection has been an integral part of governance for ages in India.
Consumers’ protection finds mention in our Vedas written thousands of years ago.
These ancient documents explain the rules of Consumer Protection and the kind of punishment to be given to the trader who indulges in wrong practices.
You will be astonished to know that in India around 2500 years ago, during the period of Kautilya, there were guidelines for the government regarding how the trade should be regulated and the interest of the consumers be protected.
The Posts in the organisational structure in the Kautilya period may be considered as Director of Trade and the Superintendent of Standards in today’s context.
Friends, we consider consumer as gods.
Protection of consumer interests is a priority of the government.
This is also reflected in our resolution of the New India.
Moving beyond Consumer Protection, New India will have Best Consumer Practices and Consumer Prosperity.
Friends, today we are in process of enacting a new Consumer Protection Act keeping in view the business practices and requirements of the country.
The proposed Act lays great emphasis on consumer empowerment.
Rules are being simplified to ensure that Consumer grievances are redressed in a time-bound manner and at least possible cost.
Stringent provisions are proposed against misleading advertisements.
A Central Consumer Protection Authority with executive powers will be constituted for quick remedial action.
We have enacted the Real Estate Regulatory Act for the protection of home buyers.
Earlier, consumers waited for years to get the possession of their homes as they would fall prey to unscrupulous builders.
There used to be ambiguity regarding the area of the flat.
Now after RERA, only registered developers can seek bookings only after getting all the required permissions.
Moreover, booking amount has been fixed only at 10 per cent.
Earlier, the builders used to divert the money received for bookings to other projects.
Now government has made a stringent provision that 70 per cent of the payment received from buyers will be kept in an “Escrow” account and this amount will be spent on that project only.
Similarly, the Bureau of Indian Standard Act has also been enacted.
Now any commodity or service related to public or consumer interest can be brought under compulsory certification.
This Act also has provisions to order recall of substandard products from the market and for compensation in case of loss or damages incurred by the consumer.
Recently, India has also implemented Goods and Services Tax-GST.
After GST, dozens of different types of indirect taxes in the country have been abolished.
Many Hidden Taxes have also gone away.
Now, the consumer knows how much tax he has paid to the state government and how much to the central government.
The queues of the trucks on the borders now no longer exist.
It is a transparent system in which no one can hurt the interests of the Consumers.
Increased competition due to the GST will lead to moderation in prices.
It will directly benefit poor and middle class consumers.
Friends, besides strengthening the interests of the consumers through the law, it is also necessary that the grievances of the people are promptly addressed.
In the last three years, our government has created a new eco-system for Grievance Redressal by making efficient use of technology.
About 40 percent complaints get transferred directly to the companies automatically through the portal enabling quick action.
I can confidently state that this govt. has used social media positively for Consumer Protection in India, as has never been done before.
Development of any country and consumer protection are complementary.
Good governance has an important role in taking the benefits of development to every citizen.
Ensuring delivery of rights and services to the deprived by the Government is also a way of protecting interests of the consumers.
All these efforts are for providing Basic Lifeline support to people and to make their lives more comfortable.
Interests of consumers are not protected by merely giving them rights.
In India we are also working to formulate schemes which help consumers save money.
The poor and middle class in the country is benefitted most from these schemes.
You might also be aware that UNICEF has recently announced findings of a survey in India.
According to the survey, considering medical costs averted, value of time savings and mortality averted, financial savings for each household in Open Defecation Free communities are Rs. 50,000 per year.
Friends, Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojna has been launched to provide affordable medicines to the poor.
More than 500 medicines have been included in the list of essential drugs and their prices have been reduced.
Capping prices of Coronary Stents have made them cheaper by up to 85 per cent.
Recently, prices of knee implants have also been brought under control.
Our thinking is to move beyond Consumer Protection to promotion of Consumers Interest.
Our scheme, Ujala is another example of monetary saving in Consumer Interest.
This simple scheme for distribution of LED bulb has shown extraordinary results.
When this government assumed charge, cost of a LED bulb was Rs. 350-/.
After government’s efforts, the same bulb is now available in just Rs. 40 to 45-/ under the scheme.
Therefore, this scheme alone has caused saving of more than Rs. 20 thousand crores for consumers by reducing the cost of LED bulb and through reduction in electricity bills.
By strengthening the Public Distribution System through technology, it is also being ensured that the poor, who have the right to affordable food grains, get their due.
Under the Direct Benefit Scheme, by transferring the money directly into the beneficiaries’ bank accounts the government has prevented leakage of more than Rs. 57 thousand crores.
Friends, it is necessary that the consumers also understand their shared responsibilities towards the society and discharge their duties in this regard to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.
Subsidy is provided on LPG cylinders in our country.
On my appeal, within a short time of around one year, more than one crore people have given up their gas subsidy.
The savings thereon have been used in giving free gas connections to 3 crore households so far.
It is an example that how the shared contribution from each consumer benefits other consumers thus creating a positive environment in the society towards one’s duties.
Friends, Government is implementing Prime Minister Rural Digital Literacy Campaign for Digital Empowerment of Consumers living in rural areas of the country.
Under this scheme, one person each from 6 crore households is being made digitally literate.
This campaign will facilitate villagers for electronic transactions and availing Government services digitally.
Digital awareness in the villages of India is also creating a huge e-commerce market for the future.
Unified Payment Interface-UPI has given the e-commerce industry a lot of strength.
Bharat Interface For Money – i.e. BHIM App has expanded digital payments in cities as well as in rural areas.
Friends, India is one of the world’s largest markets on the strength of the population of more than 125 crore and the fast growing middle class.
The openness of our economy welcomes every country in the world, brings Indian consumers closer to the global players.
Every country represented here is engaged in its own way for protecting the interests of their consumers.
But we must also keep in mind that now with the increasing Globalization, the whole world is changing into a single market.
Therefore it is very important to learn from each other’s experiences, to explore the points of common understanding and to discuss the possibility of building a Regional Coalition for Consumer Protection through such an event.
Friends, Asian countries provide large business opportunities because of large consumer base of more than 4 billion, increasing purchasing power and young demographic profile.
Under these circumstances, a strong regulatory system in every country and information sharing is a must for sustaining consumer confidence.
Taking pride in our culture while respecting other cultures is part of our tradition.
I hope that keeping in view the future challenges a roadmap with a clear vision for moving forward will be prepared in this conference.
I am hopeful that we will also succeed in institutionalizing regional cooperation through this conference.
I once again express gratitude to you for participating in this conference.
Thanks a lot!

To contain temperature rise we must also change our temperament.
We look forward to a concrete outcome at COP21 in Paris that strengthens the commitment and the ability of the world, especially of poor and vulnerable countries, to transition to a more sustainable growth path.
As we discussed in the G4 Summit in New York, Chancellor and I are committed to pursue reforms of the United Nations, especially the Security Council.
We have a common perspective on this region; the turbulence in West Asia; Europe’s challenges; and, shaping a peaceful and stable Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.
I especially thanked her for Germany’s invaluable support for peace, security and development in Afghanistan.
Finally, a very special word of gratitude to Chancellor Merkel and the people of Germany for the return of the 10th century statue of Durga in her Mahishasurmardini avatar from Jammu and Kashmir.
She is a symbol of the victory of good over evil.
This also suggests that in this age of transitions and turmoil, India-Germany partnership will be a force of good for the world.
It is a saying common to both our cultures that friendship is a plant that needs to be watered.

This year, students from across the country, and also Indian students residing abroad, participated in the event.
He expressed happiness that parents and teachers too are part of this programme.
A student preparing for the UPSC examination also asked a similar question.
In response, the Prime Minister said that while he would not advise anyone to stay completely unaffected by an examination, it is important to understand the context of the examination.
Is an examination, an exam for life, or is it an exam for a particular grade like Class 10 or 12, he asked the gathering.
He said that once this context is understood, the stress will reduce.
The Prime Minister emphasized that parents should not expect their children to fulfil their own unfulfilled dreams.
Every child has his or her own potential and strengths, and it is important to understand these positives of every child, he noted.
The Prime Minister also said that expectations are essential.
We cannot live in an atmosphere of despair and unhappiness, he asserted.
Answering a set of questions on stress of parents, and parental pressure, the Prime Minister said that the performance of children cannot become a calling card for the parents.
He said that if that becomes the aim, then expectations become unrealistic.
He said that some people have the view that Modi has raised expectations as Prime Minister.
He added that he is of the view that 1.25 billion Indians should have 1.25 billion aspirations.
Those aspirations should also be expressed, and we should collectively raise our abilities to meet those aspirations, he added.
A parent expressed an apprehension that her son was once good in studies, but is now distracted by online games.
In response, the Prime Minister said that he does not believe that exposure to technology is, per se, bad for students.
He believes that is good that students are getting acquainted with new technology.
However, he added that technology should lead to an expansion of the mind.
It should be a means to innovate.
The PlayStation is good, but one must not forget the playing field, he added.
In response to a question on time management and exhaustion, the Prime Minister said that 1.25 billion Indians are all his family.

Students sought the Prime Minister’s advice on subject and career choices.
Yes, science and maths are essential but there are other subjects too worth exploring, he added.
There are opportunities in so many areas now, the Prime Minister said.
A student recalled last year’s town hall interaction on the same subject, and said that her parents have become a lot more relaxed when it comes to subjects like exams and career.He said that positive attitude of the parents can contribute in a big way to the lives of children.
Students spoke to the Prime Minister about the need to encourage children.
In response, he said that competition should not be with others, but with one’s own record.
He said that when one competes with one’s own past record, then pessimism and negativity can easily be defeated.
Students also mentioned the need to further improve education systems and ensure that exams are not only reduced to rote learning but also showcase what students have learnt.
In response, the Prime Minister said that our learning cannot be reduced to exams only.
Our education must equip us to face various challenges of life as well, he added.
Speaking on the subject of depression, the Prime Minister said that in a nation like ours, this issue is worrying.
He said that a person does not get depressed all of a sudden.
There are signs that show a person is heading into depression.
Ignoring these signs is not a good idea.
On the contrary, we must talk about this, the Prime Minister said.
He said that counselling can be helpful because it helps one talk about one’s problems.

“Birthday greetings to our beloved Atal ji.
We salute this great personality who provided exceptional leadership to India at a crucial time.
Be it as a party leader, Parliamentarian, Minister, Prime Minister, Atal ji distinguished himself in every role.
This is his speciality.
After landing in Delhi this evening, will head straight to Atal ji’s residence and wish him personally”, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister, on his twitter page also shared a poem written by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee published in weekly ‘Abhudaya’ in 1946.
He also spoke of various initiatives and schemes of the Government of India.
I am told that there are about four thousand friends, young and old, present here.
Incidentally, 125 years ago, when Swami Vivekanandji spoke at the World Congress of Religions in Chicago, there were about four thousand people in the audience.
I do not know if there is any other example of celebrating the anniversary of a great, inspiring address.
Perhaps not.
This celebration, therefore, shows the impact of Swami ji’s address – how it changed the way the west saw India and how Indian thought and philosophy found its rightful place.
The event you have organised makes the anniversary of the Chicago address even more special.
Congrats to everybody associated with the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, the Government of Tamil Nadu, thousands of my young friends assembled here today for being part of the commemoration of the historic address.
This combination of the unique satvik qualities of Saints, and the energy and enthusiasm of the young people assembled here is a symbol of the real strength of India.
Friends, through his address Swami Vivekanandshone the light of Indian culture, philosophy and ancient traditions for the entire world.
Many people have written about the address in Chicago.
You have, during your deliberations today, also talked about the key points of his address.
We will keep going back to Swami Ji’s words and learn new things from them.
The foreign rulers, their judges, their preachers,lost no opportunity to look down upon our thousand years of knowledge and cultural heritage.
Swamiji reminded us all that “this is the land from whence, like the tidal waves, spirituality and philosophy have again and again rushed out and deluged the world; and this is the land from whence more such tides proceed in order to bring life and vigour to the decaying races of man-kind”.
Swami Vivekanandji, not only left his mark on the world, but also gave new energy and a new confidence to the freedom movement of the country.
Recently, in the Asian games, our players have shown that no matter how poor you are, no matter what kind of a family you come from, with confidence and hard work, you can make your country proud of you.
Besides, our government has opened the doors of the banks for youth who want to achieve their dreams on their own.
Under the Mudra scheme more than 13 crore loans have been given so far.
This scheme is playing a significant role in enhancing self-employment in the villages and towns of the country.
The Government is also providing an encouraging platform for Innovative Ideas under the Start Up India Campaign.
Our approach is not only to eradicate poverty but also to root out the causes of poverty in the country.
I must remind you that this day is also the anniversary of a very different kind of event – the terrorist attacks of 9/11 that echoed through the world.
Democracy and Debate are our eternal values.
And during these periods of struggle, our saints, social reformers have shown us the right path – the path that brings us back together.
We have to build a new India with the inspiration of Swami Vivekanand.
Congrats to all those thousands of friends in schools and colleges who read and understood the messages of Swamiji, took part in competitions and won prizes.
Thanks again to all of you.”

Honorable Speaker of Wolesi Jirga and the Chairman of Meshraon Jirga,
Distinguished Members of both Houses.
Eight centuries ago, a famous son of Balkh Province, one of the greatest poets in human history, Jalaluddin Rumi, wrote, “Raise your words, not your voice.
It is rain that gives flowers, not thunder.”
This is the wisdom of this magnificent land and a great Nation.
A land where legends are born – of poetry and beauty, of valour and honour, of pride and generosity, of the warmest embrace of friendship and the strongest resistance for freedom.
And, in this century, the great Afghan people have waged an epic struggle of courage and resolve to shape their future with vote and debate, not gun and violence.
A country with an abiding faith in the tradition of Jirga has chosen the path of democracy.
And, it has done it against challenges that would have defeated a lesser people.
It is a tribute to the countless, nameless Afghans who laid down their lives and sacrificed their future.
Honourable Members,
So, I stand here, on behalf of 1.25 billion friends in India, in admiration for your achievements, in gratitude for your friendship and in solidarity for your future.
And, today, I am humbled and honoured to join President Ghani and all the Members of the Afghan Parliament to dedicate this new abode of democracy to the Afghan nation.
Eleven years ago, he dreamt of this project in partnership with Karzai Saheb.
And, we are deeply touched that you have chosen to name one of the wings in this building the Atal Block.
This Parliament House brings together our two nations through the vision of our leaders, the labour of our people and the stones of our lands.
It captures the spirit of Afghanistan and of our friendship.
This Parliament Complex is a small tribute to your progress as a nation and a democracy.
And, it will stand as an enduring symbol of the ties of emotions and values, of affection and aspirations that bind us in a special relationship.
Honourable Members,
Our ties are as ancient as history.
Over the mighty Hindu Kush and through the forbidding Khyber Pass, monks, merchants and monarchs have linked us through knowledge, culture, religion,commerce and kingdoms.
In the shifting contours of history, there were times we have been one.
There were times we saw wars.
But, through the ages, we have always enriched one another.
In the timeless Buddhist symbols of Aynak and Bamian and in the majestic monuments of Delhi, in our culture and art, in language and literature, food and festivals, we see the imprint of our timeless relations.
We owe to ancient Afghanistan the gift of one of the great characters of Mahabharata, Gandhari.
In the achievements of Mauryan Empire or Shershah Suri, we see connectivity that we now aspire to rebuild.
The words of poet Ahmed Shah Durrani may have expressed the longing of an Afghan King in Delhi, I forget the throne of Delhi, when I remember the mountain tops of my Afghan land.
But, in the heart of every Indian and Afghan, there is boundless love for each other.
We love each other’s culture and cinema, music and poetry, food and festivals.
And, now we admire each other’s cricket.
We are delighted that the Afghan National Cricket Team has found its home ground near Delhi and is practicing for next year’s World Cup.
And, i congratulatethe Afghan Under 19 team that just beat Zimbabwe in its first home series.
King Amanullah once told the Maharaja that so long as India was not free, Afghanistan was not free in the right sense.
Honourable Members,
This is the spirit of brotherhood between us.
And, when you began a new journey in a new century, we were proud to stand with you and walk with you.
Our partnership has helped rural communities get schools, minor irrigation, health centres, welfare for children and opportunities for women.
Together, we have built roads that have brought regions closer;
power transmission lines and power stations that light up Afghan homes;
satellite links that bring education, medical advice and communication to Afghan people.
And, we are helping the security forces become more mobile.
Nothing is more important for a nation than its human resources.
Power and water will flow out of Salma Dam soon.
The Stor Palace will again stand as a symbol of your priceless heritage.
Our scheme of 1000 scholarships every year for Afghan students in India will continue.
We are pleased with the response to our special scholarship scheme in agriculture science.
As we have stood with you in our efforts to rebuild your country, you have guarded and protected our people as your own.
We have faced daily threats, but we feel secure in your midst.
To every Afghan, who has risked or lost his life so that his Indian guest is safe, I convey the eternal gratefulness of India.
To Indian diplomats, officers, engineers and doctors, who serve here with pride, to the families of our Indian martyrs, I express the gratitude of Indians and Afghans.
There are some who did not want us to be here.
There were those who saw sinister designs in our presence here.
There are others who were uneasy at the strength of our partnership.
Some even tried to discourage us.
But, we are here because you have faith in us.
You never doubted the sincerity of our commitment and the strength of our friendship.
And, you have seen the fruits of our partnership.
You have judged us by what you see, not what others tell you, including about the mysterious Indian consulates.
You know that India is here to contribute not to compete; to lay the foundations of future, not light the flame of conflict; to rebuild lives, not destroy a nation.
You know, as we do, that Indians and Afghans have always stood for each other, never against another.
You have been at the crossroads of history.
And, your history tells us that you will never let yourself become a theatre of competition; or serve the designs of others.
For you live by the creed extolled by poet Kushal Khan Khattak that Nation’s honor and nation’s fame on life they have a prior claim.
We know that Afghanistan’s success will require the cooperation and support of each of its neighbours.
And, all of us in the region – India, Pakistan, Iran and others – must unite, in trust and cooperation, behind this common purpose and in recognition of our common destiny.
When Afghanistan becomes a haven of peace and a hub for the flow of ideas, commerce, energy and investments in the region, we will all prosper together.
That is why we are working to improve your connectivity by land and sea, including through Chahbahar in Iran.
That is why I hope that Pakistan will become a bridge between South Asia and Afghanistan and beyond.
I hope that the day will come soon when energy from Central Asia will power prosperity in our region; when a Kabuliwala can once again come across easily to win Indian hearts; when we in India can relish the wonderful fruits of Afghanistan; when Afghans do not have to pay an enormous price to buy their favourite products from India.
For this has always been the course of this region’s history.
And, it must be the path to its future.
Terror and violence cannot be the instrument to shape Afghanistan’s future or dictate the choices Afghans make..
For, the fire that is lit in Afghanistan, can never be contained, within these boundaries.
And, Afghans of all persuasions must have the right to seek peace among themselves.
Too much blood has flown down Kabul River.
Too many tragedies have darkened the mountain slopes.
Too many dreams have burnt in the fire of a senseless conflict.
But, you are proud Afghans who can come together as one nation and one people.
You may have fought in the name of religion; or in the cause of identity.
But, it is now time for Afghans to come together in peace.
As a wise Afghan said, A tree with a bitter seed, Fed with butter and sugar, Will still bear a bitter fruit.
You have a glorious tradition of pluralism and respect for diversity and beliefs.
Those waging war from outside must seek a path to this building and this hall.
Those seeking territory through gun must seek power through ballot.
Those who have destroyed homes must now rebuild their nation.
For, this is your land and these are your people.
And, it must be on your terms, on your genius, through your own process and your own spirit of brotherhood.
Not driven by the calculations or ambitions of others.
And, the future you build in peace and through dialogue must preserve the hard-won progress of the last decade and half.
It must have a place for every Afghan.
It must have space for everyone’s aspiration.
And, it must be a nation, where every citizen is secure of her rights and confident about her future.
And, as Afghans take responsibility for their future, the world must stand with them in solidarity and support.
We must do that for the soldier from a foreign land who laid down his life in an Afghan village that he had never heard of and for a people he had never known; and, for the enormous sacrifices that Afghans have made for a life that others take for granted.
The world will be a better place when we can experience the real wealth of Afghan people in their diversity and rich heritage.
It is time for all Afghans, everyone in the region and the rest of the world to come together.
The sacrifices must not go in vain.
The flame of hope should not die.
No girl that steps into the world should slip into darkness of denied opportunities.
No son should face the choice of gun or refuge in a distant land.
No mother should fear bringing a child into this world.
No leader should lose a brother because he spoke for Afghan freedom to choose friends.
No one kneeling in prayer in a mosque should be killed in the name of religion.
No elder should look back on his youth wasted in conflict, and see the same future for his grandchild.
Every youth in Afghanistan should see a future in which IT stands for information technology, not international terrorism.
For, the promise and the opportunities of the 21st century belong to Afghan youth as much as anyone else in the world.
For India, this is a deeply held commitment.
Your suffering is our pain.
Your dreams are our duty.
Your strength is our belief.
Your courage is our inspiration.
Above all, your friendship is our honour.
I am confident that Hope will return to your homes, Laughter in your schools, Life in your streets, Prosperity in your cities, unity in your society and peace in your nation.
And, at every step of your journey, India will be with you.
Thank you again for this great honour and privilege.
Defence Minister of France calls on PM
We created the Act East Policy and the North-east is at the heart of it.
The Act East Policy requires increased people to people contact, trade ties and other relations with countries on India’s east, particularly ASEAN countries.
The tag-line of this Summit is very appropriate and gives a big Message.
Recently, we had the ASEAN India Summit celebrating 25 years of our partnership.
ASEAN-India partnership, may be 25 years old but our ties with these nations go back to thousands of years.
It was a privilege for India to host Heads of 10 ASEAN countries as honoured Guests at our Republic Day function in New Delhi.
Bangladesh has recently opened a consulate in Guwahati, becoming the first country to do so.
Development of MSME sector is a priority for us as this is the back-bone of our industries.
In this year’s budget we are giving a big relief to MSMEs by reducing rate of income tax to 25% on companies reporting a turn-over of up to Rs. 250 crore.
Now, Government will contribute 12% to EPF for new employees in all sectors for three years.
This Budget has provided additional deduction to the employees of 30% of the wages paid for new employees under the Income Tax Act.
We are also rolling out e-assessment of income tax across the country to eliminate corruption and bring efficiency and transparency.
Further, the women employees’ contribution to EPF will be 8% for first three years against existing rate of 12%.
The Union Government has taken up many path breaking economic reforms in last three years, which have simplified procedures for doing business.
It is a result of these reforms that India today ranks 100 among 190 countries in the Doing Business Report, of the World Bank, after climbing up 42 ranks!
The position of India has improved in many other ratings like Global Competitive–ness Index of World Economic Forum and Moody’s rating upgrade from stable to positive in November 2017.
Our policies have ensured that inflation remains below 5% mark.
Now, we have Foreign Exchange Reserves of US Dollars 418 Billion.
I am sure that with the present leadership of the State Government, Assam is going to further improve its current position to emerge as one of the most sought after states for industrial investment in the country.
We will be developing 35,000 kilometers of roads with investment of Rupees 5.35 lakh crore under ‘Bharatmala’ project.
The Railways will make an investment of Rupees 1.48 lakh crore in 2018-19.
Our target is to re-develop 600 major Railway Stations in coming years.
Once again I congratulate the people of Assam and North East for holding such a big event with great fervour.

The expedition, known as the Navika Sagar Parikrama, was the first-ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew.
Thank you for welcoming me with such warmth and affection.
Your love and affection makes my visit to this great country all the more special.
From across the vast Indian Ocean, I bring with me the warm friendship and best wishes of 1.25 billion Indians.
Before starting my visit I have personally emailed to all of you, inviting your ideas and suggestions for my today’s speech.
On NarendraModi App I received thousands of innovative and useful suggestions.
And these suggestions have helped me to enrich my interaction with you today.
Both, in our hearts and our minds,
Centuries ago, our ancestors travelled to the unknown shores of South Africa.
They faced hardship and extreme poverty.
Yet, they endured and kept going.
Under decades of Apartheid isolation, they not only preserved their culture, traditions and language.
They also gave them new wings to flourish.
And, today, the beauty of Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu and Telugu continues to enrich the fabric of South African society.
The colours of Holi, the sparkle of Diwali, tastes of Pongal, and festivities of Eid are not just the rainbow of Indian cultural traditions.
They also symbolize the vibrant diversity of South Africa.
The story of your ancestors in this nation may have been of poverty and oppression.
But, their legacy is one of pride and sacrifice.
And, it is reflected in your success and prosperity.
Its reality rests in your immense contribution to the economic and social well-being of this great country.
Not many of you may recognize, but there is one contribution of your ancestors, that you should be proud of.
Your ancestors were one of the first to leave the shores of India.
In many ways, what Indian diaspora stands for all over the world today is because of what your forefathers were able to achieve despite all adversities.
This city and its people mean a lot to us.
It was here that Mahatma Gandhi conceptualised his politics.
This is the birthplace of Satyagraha.
South Africa transformed Mohandas into a Mahatma.
But, Gandhi was not alone in his fight against racial oppression.
The South African freedom struggle also has many heroes among you.
Who can forget the sacrifice of sixteen year old Valliamma, the fearless Thambi Naidoo and the selfless Mohammed Cachalia?
I had the privilege of meeting Ahmed Kathrada earlier today.
He spent 26 years in prison alongside Nelson Mandela.
Alongside their African brothers and sisters, generations of Indians fought, suffered and sacrificed so that all of South Africa could breathe freely.
I salute you all, and the countless others, dedicated to this country.
You are the proud sons and daughters of the Indian heritage.
You are the proud and loyal citizens of South Africa.You are the hardworking and loyal citizens of South Africa.
You are also a part of the flourishing global Indian family.
You form a unique bond between our two great nations.
A bond that is nurtured by our shared values and struggles.
A bond on whose foundation we are building the promise of our prosperous future.
South Africa is a sacred land.
It is the land of Madiba , and the कर्मभूमि of Mahatma Gandhi.
The path these two great men have shown us, and the freedom that they have won for us, is an inspiration for all of mankind.
We live in a world that is inter-dependent and hyper-connected.
Many of you are now closely engaged with developments in India.
We want enterprises to flourish, businesses to grow and the country to rise.
For this, we are already shaping a policy framework that strengthens India’s ability to build trade, manufacturing, innovation and investment partnerships with other countries in the world.
Our focus on Ease of Doing Business is aimed at ensuring that the public, private and personal businesses can grow to their full potential in India.
And, we want it to be driven by state of the art infrastructure.
Our plan to build 100 smart cities is aimed at creating an urbanized society that is sustainable, and easy on the environment and on our resources.
India, like South Africa is a young nation.
The energy and drive of our 800 million youth fuels and mirrors the ambition and aspiration of the entire country.
We want them to be the engine that pulls India’s economy and society.
And, for this, we are working in campaign mode to skill India’s youth.
The plan is to generate over 500 million new jobs in India by 2022.
Our two countries have similar aspirations and challenges.
India was one of the leaders of the international movement for freedom in this country.
We led from the front in the global fight against Apartheid.
But, as I said earlier, as the Rainbow nation was born, we were also the first ones to extend the warm embrace of our friendship.
In our economic choices, we can do many things together for our youth and for our people.
Both India and South Africa, have huge demographic opportunities.
We both have a young population.
Two-thirds of our people in India are below the age of 35.
Similar is the story on the African continent, and in South Africa.
We must share our experiences, our partnership and our expertise to meet our development goals.
As South Africa works towards economic prosperity, safety and security for its people, it will find in India a trusted and reliable partner.
India is ready to join you in this journey.
Our development and business partnerships are already doing well.
But we must do more to help them gallop, to run as the springbok.
Together we can create new enterprises, new skills and new social values.
India and South Africa are strategic partners.
We should build a partnership that spans the entirety of the human endeavour.
A partnership that scales new heights in diverse fields:
They can also be instrument of change on this continent.
We can work together, to empower youth, to fight poverty, malnutrition, disease and hunger.
Fight against terrorism and piracy, AIDS and Ebola are some of the key priorities of our partnership.
Our partnership for economic prosperity also has to be sensitive to Climate Change.
We agreed to a landmark deal in Paris.
We now have to work together as strong partners to look at new energy pathways and technology solutions for a climate smart world.
Through IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa) and BRICS, our partnership is also shaping priorities within the global agenda.
A resurgent India awaits you.
And, we have taken several steps towards eliminating barriers of entry.
The OCI and PIO schemes have been rolled into one.
In February this year we launched e-visa for South Africa.
You can now get Indian visa sitting at home in your email, and that too at no cost!
Brothers and Sisters, India and South Africa have much to benefit from a closer partnership.
You are a window to India’s heritage, to our ethos and to our values.
And, you form an important life line for our ties with this land.
In conclusion, let me say that your achievements, your contributions and your success makes us all proud.

He offered prayers at the Sanctum Sanctorum, and was given a rousing reception by the monks.
Interacting with the monks, the Prime Minister said that he is fortunate to visit the Pagoda, and recalled that India’s first President Dr. Rajendra Prasad had visited this Pagoda in 1959.
Noting that links between India and Vietnam were 2000 years old, the Prime Minister said that while some came to make war, India had come with the message of peace – the message of Buddha, which has endured.
He said the world must walk on the path of peace, which brings happiness and prosperity.
The Prime Minister invited them to visit the land of the Buddha, and especially Varanasi, which he represents in Parliament.
The project is implemented by India International Convention & Exhibition Centre Limited, a 100% Government owned company under Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

The Union Government and the State Government are working together for the progress of Rajasthan, he said.
He talked about the increase in Minimum Support Price for various crops, announced for the current Kharif season.
The Prime Minister also mentioned the progress made by various schemes of the Union Government in the State of Rajasthan, including Swachh Bharat Mission, Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, and Saubhagya Yojana.

Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) / Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) will also be implemented in these Public Sector Undertakings.
The Department of Pharmaceuticals, the administrative department for these undertakings, will take time bound follow-up action.
My colleague in the council of Ministers, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs, Shri PP Chaudhary Ji,
My heartfelt greetings to all those associated with the institution on this occasion.
It has been a privilege for me to be amongst the people who have been a part of this journey of the ICSI over the past 49 years and felicitate them.
I am honored to be with the experts who ensure that every company in the country follows the law of the land, maintain complete transparency and do not fudge its .The onus is on you to see to it what should be the corporate culture of the country.
The motto of your institute is Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara .
It implies that one should speak he truth and follow rules and regulation.
Your advice- right or wrong has an impact on the corporate Governance of the country..
Friends, on several occasions, it has been seen that the people do not tread the path which they ought to have done.
For example, both Yudhishtir and Duryodhan were taught by the same Guru, however their actions were altogether different.
Your institution reminds such people of the values from this lesson of Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara.
In the same way, even if one member of the family does wrong, the reputation of the entire family is at stake’
Friends, this axiom applies in the context of the nation as well.
A handful of people in our country have been engaged in harming its reputation, they have been trying to weaken our honest social fabric.
The Government has launched a campaign to clean-up the system and the institutions from such elements once it assumed office.
Under this campaign immediately after the formation of the government, a Special Investigation Team – SIT, has been set up by the Cabinet in its first decision.
Brothers and sisters, This government has worked to strengthen the institutional probity in the country.
As a result of relentless hard work by this government alone, we are having a less cash economy.
9th November, 2016 will be remembered as the opening day of corruption free movement in the history of India.
The cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9 per cent after Demonetization.
It used to be above 12 per cent before 8th November 2016.
Friends, There was another character, Shalya in the Mahabharata.
Shalya was charioteer of Karna.
On the other hand, Krishna was the Sarathi of Arjuna.
This character, Shalya always used to discourage those who were in the battle field and spread despair.
He used to say, you don’t have the courage, your horses and chariot are weak and how would you fight.
Shalya belonged to the Mahabharata era.
But still we have some people having the same Shalya mentality.
Such people take pleasure in spreading the despair.
The slowdown in the GDP even in one quarter has become the biggest news item these days for such people.
They are perpetually in a mode of pessimism saying how will you do it and what will happen next.
When the Doklam issue surfaced.
They again tried to spread pessimism thinking, nothing can be done.
Some people take pleasure is spreading pessimism.
They get a good sleep out of it.
Friends, When the data suits their thinking, the institutions and processes appear correct to them.
However, the moment, the same data is unsuitable for them, they immediately start questioning the institutions and its processes.
No it’s not.
The GDP growth slipped to 5.7% or even lower 8 times during six years of the previous government.
Nation’s economy has seen those quarters when the growth rate slipped down to 0.2 per cent, 1.5 per cent.
That kind of slowdown was even more harmful for the economy since during those years India was also struggling with higher Inflation, higher Current Account Deficit and higher Fiscal Deficit.
If you look at the two preceding years before 2014 such as 2012-13 and 2013-14, the average growth rate was around 6%.
Because, it won’t take much time for people with Shalya mentality to contest it.
Friends, I have referred to those two years because the method to calculate the GDP growth has been during and those two years of the previous government and three years of this government.
When Central Statistics Office, CSO released the figure of 7.4% GDP growth during the tenure of this government, some people dismissed it.
It was their view that the GDP data did not match with their own understanding of the ground realities.
These people said that they were not able to feel that economy was indeed growing at that rate.
It means that it does not fit into their Shalya mentality.
Same Institutions were not of their liking , same processes were not of their liking at that time.
But the moment, GDP growth rate came down to 5.7% , it lifted their spirit.
They began telling, the institutions are correct.
Brothers and sisters, I’m not an economist and neither have I ever claimed so.
However, today when so much of discussion is taking place about the economy, I would like to take you back in time.
Brothers and sisters, there was a time when India was included in a group related to international economy called Fragile Five, unlike the groups today like, G-7, G-8 or G-20.
India was named as a member of the same group.
A person like me, who has little knowledge of economy is still unable to understand how such a thing happened despite the presence of those top economists at that time.
You must be aware about thar around that time the issues hogging limelight were –the growth in the inflation rate rather than GDP growth, while growth in current account deficit and fiscal deficit were prominently in the news.
Growth in the rate of Dollar vis a vis Rupee used to be the headline in the newspapers while the growth of interest rate was animatedly debated .
At that time, these parameters which reverse the growth trajectory of the nation were the favourite of a handful of people.
Now when the same parameters have shown marked improvements, development is in the right direction, a handful of people are still having a look at it with their colored vision.
I am also showing you the slides.
Can you compare 10% with 2.5%.
Current Account Deficit which was 4% has come down to nearly 1%.
You can see it.
While improving upon the parameters, the Central Government has brought down the fiscal deficit from 4.5% under the previous regime to 3.5%.
India’’s Foreign Exchange Reserve has gone up by 25% from around $30,000 crore to $40,000 crore.
Friends, it is correct that despite attaining average growth rate of 7.5% over the past three years, GDP growth rate in April-June period this year saw a decline.
We don’t deny it.
The financial stability of the country will be maintained.
We would take every step to bring in more investments. and carry forward the momentum of growth.
Government is alert to reach out to and if needed to provide assistance to any sector following the structural reforms sector.
It can be MSME or export sector or a part of our non-formal economy.
I would like to reiterate from this forum that in the changing scenario, honesty will command a premium and the Government will protect the interest of honest persons.
I know that there is an element of apprehension among some of the traders who have joined the mainstream that whether their old records would be tracked seeing their new businesses.
There can’t be a greater sin than stopping you from joining the mainstream.
We have sought feedback even on minor issues.
During the three years of our government, 1 lakh 20 thousand kilometers long rural roads have been constructed.
This figure has gone up to Rs. 1.83 lakh crores in this government.
It means this government has nearly doubled the investment.
During the three years of this government, 2600 kilometer long railway track has been converted in the double line.
It means that we have carried out the work of doubling of railway tracks twice as fast.
Friends, capital expenditure worth Rs. 1.49 lakh crore was made during the last three years of the previous government.
During the three years of this government, this figure has gone up to Rs. 2.64 lakh crore.
·If we talk about the growth of shipping industry during the previous government, then the growth in cargo handling was negative during its tenure whereas during the three years of this government, it has registered an increase of 11%.
Friends, The government has been paying full attention for strengthening the social infrastructure of the country along with the strengthening of physical infrastructure related to important sectors like rail-road and electricity.
We have taken major policy decisions and carried out financial reforms in the field of affordable housing which are unprecedented for the sector.
Friends, during the last three years of the previous government, it approved the projects worth Rs. 15,000 crores.
While this government has cleared projects worth Rs. 1.53 lakh crores during its first three years.
Brothers and sisters, More capital investment is required for this kind of developmental work that is taking place across the country.
-You might be aware that when the issue of reforms in the insurance sector was first discussed, the newspaper headlines used to say that if such a thing happens, it would be a major economic decision.
It was during the previous government.
That government completed its term without bringing reforms in the insurance sector.
We have brought in the reforms in the insurance sector.
It happened during this government.
Big changes have been brought about in the investment policies related to several sectors including construction sector, defence sector, financial services, food processing , or other sectors you name it.
If you compare the total amount of foreign investment in India that has come after the liberalization and the foreign investment made during the last three years, you will realize the impact of economic reforms carried out by our government.
Brothers and sisters, you are from this field.
However, the statistics which I am placing before you will leave you surprised.
The liberalization time frame began after 1992.
·So far more than 26 crore LED bulbs have been distributed in the country.
If we consider an average reduction of Rs. 250 in the price of a bulb, even then the middle class of the country has saved nearly Rs. 6,500 crores on this account.
These bulbs have reduced the electricity consumption in every household.
It has resulted in the estimated savings worth Rs. 14,000 crores to the middle class families in just one year.
Now you see the total savings on LED bulb purchase and electricity consumption becomes more than Rs.20,000 crores.
This, in itself is empowering the middle class families.
·Due to the efforts made by the government, those local bodies are also reaping the financial benefits.
They have been replacing their street lights with LED bulbs.
As per an estimate, the municipality of a tier-two town has made on an average saving Rs. 10-15 crore.
However, I cannot compromise with the future of the country to protect my present.
Do we need to worry only about the power and the vote.?
We have chosen the path which is difficult.
However we are treading the right path keeping in mind the welfare of the people.
I have to often face criticism for this reason.
Look, if you hand out doles, people will sing paeans for you.
I am being criticized.
The vested interests feel aggrieved since my Government believes in transferring the money into the accounts of the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit transfer.
It has ensured that ghost accounts are done away with.
That is why such people won’t like PM Modi .
That is why our emphasis is on empowering the common man.
I would like to tell my fellow citizens humbly that I cannot compromise with the future of the country to protect my present.
Friends, This government has laid emphasis on the personal sector along with the private sector and public sector.
Otherwise, the discourse was confined only to the private and the public sector.
Personal Sector, which is connected to the personal aspirations of the people is equally important.
Companies have been given financial incentives for bringing more and more people in the formal economy.
In the last three years, this number has gone up to 4.80 crore.
Bank accounts of more than 30 crore poor people have been opened under the Jan-Dhan scheme.
More than three crore women have been provided a gas connection free of cost under the Ujjwala scheme.
Nearly 15 crore poor people have been brought under the coverage of government insurance schemes.
The Saubhagya Scheme has been launched a few days ago to provide free electricity connections to the poor people.
These schemes have been empowering the poor people.
However, it is corruption and black money which have been a bane for the nation.
Your institution and the company secretaries of the country have an important role in curbing the black money and corruption.
Registration of 2.1 lakh companies of the total 3 lakh shell companies, which were suspected of channelizing the black money following the note ban, have been cancelled.
I am hopeful that the level of awareness among the directors will be increased and companies will become more transparent following this cleansing operation against the shell companies.
Friends, This period is of immense changes, of transformative changes in the history of the nation.
The importance of a transparent and honest administration is now understood in the country.
The recommendations made by the ICSI played a positive role in formulating the Corporate Governance Framework.
Now it is the need of the hour for you all to play an active role in producing a new business culture.
Nearly 19 lakh new citizens have come under the scope of indirect taxes following the implementation of GST.
Be it a small trader or a big trader, he should adopt the honest tax system inbuilt in the GST.
It is also your duty to encourage the business community in this regard.
Lakhs of students have been enrolled with your institution.
Can your institution take this responsibility that it will train one lakh youth about small-small things related to GST?
They can help small businesses and traders in their area linking them with GSTN, in filing returns after receiving a training of 7 to 10 days..
It will open up a new avenue of employment.
If it is taken up in organized way, even one lakh would be small number.
Friends, nation celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022.
We must have a dream to fulfill the aspirations and wishes of our freedom fighters and great leaders who spent their prime of life in jails, struggled for independence throughout their life and sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the country.
I hope that in the beginning of its golden jubilee year, the ICSI will embark on a journey to meet these goals with guidelines and will also include them in its work culture.
Once again, Congratulations to you all in this Golden Jubilee Year.
I would like to assure my fellow citizens that we do not take offence to the recent spate of criticisms of the Government on the economic front.
The Government is sensitive towards the concerns of the people.
We take even the harshest criticism in our stride.
I would also like to tell our critiques humbly that we do not subscribe to the view that all the critiques are wrong.
However, we should desist from creating an atmosphere of pessimism in the country.
I showed you the glimpses of a parameter which reflects the strength of our economy.
There are many other parameters which prove how strong is our economy and a clear reflection of the decision making powers of the Government.
This is the proof of the direction and momentum of the Government.
The economic strength is also reflected in the rising confidence about India both inside the country and abroad.
We should not ignore it.
Let us march ahead for building a New India with a renewed vigour, zeal, confidence and culture.
Congratulations to you all on the Golden Jubilee.
Once again many- many greetings

Being neighbours across Indian Ocean, President and I agreed to deepen our overall defence and security partnership, especially in the maritime domain.
Our in-depth discussions on regional and global issues reflected our considerable convergence on issues of common interest and concern.
We agreed to work closely, bilaterally, regionally and globally, to combat the twin threats of terrorism and climate change.
In this Alliance, which has the support of over 120 countries, we welcome Tanzania as a crucial partner.
We in India have had the honour to receive every President of Tanzania.

Shri Vinod Tawde, Vice Chancellor of Mumbai University,Shri Devenand Shinde, Romesh Wadhwani ji, Sunil Wadhwani ji,
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am happy to be here today at the inauguration of the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
Let me begin by congratulating Romesh Wadhwani ji and Sunil Wadhwani ji,The Government of Maharashtra, and Mumbai University for coming together to make this Institute a reality.
This is a prime example of how the public sector and the private sector can combine with good intention to build a world-class institute aimed at benefiting the poor.
I have had various interactions with Indian diaspora across the globe during the last three and a half years or so.
I have felt an intense desire, to make a contribution to India.
Through this Institute, Romesh ji and Sunil ji have blended this desire with a futuristic vision of a prosperous and vibrant India.
In doing so, they have set an example that is worthy of emulation.
Friends, today India is one of the fastest growing economies of the world.
We are using technology in an un-paralleled way from agriculture to aeronautics and from space missions to service delivery.
We are also witnessing a wave of entrepreneurship ranging from small enterprises to big-ticket investments.
These are just a few indicators to show, how well-placed we are to fare in the upcoming fourth industrial revolution.
But, there are also rising fears of human redundancy because there is a competition between the mind and the machine.
Such fears are neither un-founded nor new.
At every stage of technological evolution, we have faced such doubts and questions.
This leads to two views of the future.
First brings hopes and aspirations and second brings fears of disruption.
Technology opens entirely new spheres and sectors for growth.
It also opens up an entirely new paradigm of opportunities.
With each wave of new technology, many new opportunities arise.
New opportunities have always out-numbered the lost ones.
Human ingenuity has always prevailed and it will continue to do so in the future.
From this scientific enquiry this pursuit of the truth is to be obtained the ultimate creative bliss for the greater good of mankind.
It is this Vision of Technology for Development that I am inspired by and it is this spirit of Scientific Advancement that gives me optimism about the future.
The road ahead for Artificial Intelligence depends on and will be driven by Human Intentions.
It is our intention that will determine the outcomes of artificial intelligence.
With every industrial revolution, the scalability of technology has increased manifold.
This has given human increasingly more power to create an impact in whatever he does through technology.
It is this ethic of development that will ensure equity for all peoples.
The March of Technology cannot be at the expense of further increasing the difference between societies over access to technology.
The evolution of Technology has to be rooted in the ethic of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
Friends, Can we take the global lead on creating Artificial Intelligence that is less about making humans redundant and more about enhancing human abilities and expanding human capacities.
Can we make the future less about machines dis-placing humans to a future about humans becoming better humans by converting their weaknesses into their strengths for the greater good of mankind?
Friends, at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Human understanding is the solution of many problems we are facing.
We need to make Artificial Intelligence in India and Make Artificial Intelligence work for India.
I would urge all of you to identify the grand challenges that Artificial Intelligence can solve for India.
We are such a diverse nation of tens of languages and hundreds of dialects.
Can we have intelligent Artificial Intelligence that makes communication and conversations across these languages and dialects easier?
I have always believed that the Divyangs are our asset and the Nation owes it to them to empower them.
Can we have Artificial Intelligence and Robotics that enhances their abilities empowering them to perform tasks and bring out their true potential?
Can the combination of teachers and Artificial Intelligence help us bridge the gap in teacher student ratio?
This will help us deliver quality education to every student across India.
Can Artificial Intelligence help us take quality healthcare to every corner of India by expanding capacities of our healthcare workers?
Can Artificial Intelligence help us predict natural calamities?
Can Artificial Intelligence help us detect serious health conditions before they manifest physically?
Can Artificial Intelligence help our farmers make the right decisions regarding weather, crop and sowing cycle?
Friends, our Government is of the firm belief, that we can use this power of twenty-first century technology to eradicate poverty and disease.
In doing so, we can bring prosperity to our poor and under-privileged sections.

As a result the equated monthly installment (EMI) for the beneficiary would be reduced.
Under the scheme, the Government would also take necessary steps for proper convergence with PMAY-G including technical support to beneficiary through existing arrangements.
Today I will commence my visit to Russia, my first bilateral visit after we formed the Government.
I am very optimistic about the outcome of this visit.
History is witness to the close ties India and Russia have had over the decades.
Russia remains one of India’s most valued friends in the world.
My mind goes back to 2001.
I had just assumed charge as Gujarat CM and had accompanied Atal ji to Russia.
This was, perhaps, one of the first India-Russia annual Summits, a practice that goes on till date.
My visit will deepen the cooperation between India and Russia in the economic, energy and security spheres.
We also want to increase cooperation in science and technology, mining among other sectors.
Trade ties between India and Russia can increase even further, to benefit not only our two nations but also the world.
The visit will witness extensive deliberations with President Putin.
There will be an interaction with Russian businesspersons to invite them to invest in India.
I will also attend a ‘Friends of India’ programme.
I am certain that this visit will substantially take forward the already strong people to people ties between our Nations.

I feel privileged and honoured to be among sportspersons from our neighbourhood and brothers and sisters from SAARC countries.
I welcome all of you to India, a country known for its culture of अतिथि देवो भव: and to this beautiful city of Guwahati known for its hospitality and love for sports.
What moves me today, is your electrifying presence, full of excitement and enthusiasm for this important international sports event on the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra.
Guwahati has come a long way since the days of Pragjyotishpur in Ancient India.
It is now a modern and vibrant city and a hub of all economic activities in the North-Eastern Region of India.
Young people in the North-East and especially here in Assam do not miss any opportunity to witness a good football match.
This fame has spread so far and wide that the FIFA World Cup Under-17 which will be hosted first time in India in 2017 has chosen Guwahati as a prime venue for the event.
This sports meet, for me signifies a perfect blend of 3 Ts – Talent, Teamwork and Togetherness.
Among us is the best and most youthful talent from across South Asia.
You are proud members of your team – it can be your team of the sport you play and a larger team of the nation you are representing.
And, at the same time this meet also celebrates togetherness of all South Asian nations.
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka – no matter which country we are from, we all call South Asia our home.
Sports has to be an essential part of an individual’s life.
A good game is both healthy and refreshing.
All round development of the personality is incomplete without sports.
You will cherish whatever you learn on the sports field for your entire life.
I always say – Jo Khele, woh Khile.
The person who plays, shines.
The mascot of these games ‘TIKHOR‘represents a baby rhino who is sharp and intelligent.
It captures the spirit of sports persons and young sport lovers.
The theme song of the games is “Ei prithivi ekhan krirangan, krira hol shantir prangan” sung by legendary late Dr. Bhupen Hazarika.
A singer whose captivating voice left people spellbound; his song beautifully captures the spirit of South Asian Games, the spirit of peace, friendship and prosperity.
We should join hands together as a family.
Let us kindle this spirit of friendship through sports in South Asian Games.
My vision for South Asia is the same as my vision for India – Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
All South Asian countries are partners in our journey towards development.
As we gather today to commence the 12th South Asian Games, for 23 sporting events covering both men and women, we bring sports-persons from all SAARC countries to India’s North-East and to this great city in a spirit of friendship, trust and understanding.
I am sure that as the Games proceed, this feeling of friendship trust and understanding will convert itself not only into sporting opportunities but also into business and tourism opportunities as well.
Let these Games become a spring board for bringing peace and prosperity in the region through business, interaction and sporting activities.
Let this be an opportunity for SAARC people to realize their potential.
Sportsmanship is a philosophy of life harmonizing in a balanced whole the qualities of endurance, will and mind.
The challenge for performance, the joy of effort, the cheer of success, the spirit of friendship and fairplay in a sports arena speak volumes about how culture, education, ethics, dignity and society get intertwined with each other during such sports events.
On the sports field, we can forget what separates us, and we can truly connect with each other in the spirit of sportsmanship and adventure.
We can celebrate our diversity, and at the same time, be united under common rules for our sports, and the shared values of honesty and fair play.
Let us play for peace: let us play for prosperity.
Let us play with full vigour and enthusiasm so that we remember these Games even after they are over.
The friendships you would form over these 12 days, and the memories you take back will last you a lifetime.
I am confident that you will cherish these bonds, and become Ambassadors for peace and friendship between our nations.
While people play for medals and provide tough competition to each other, I urge the sports-persons and visitors here to take time from their busy schedules to visit the places of tourism attraction and wonderful wildlife sanctuaries nearby.
Once again I welcome our friends from SAARC countries.
Let the spirit of ‘Gurukul’ prevail for two weeks in Guwahati as sportspersons share with each other their best and take back great feeling of warmth and remarkable experience.
Let the competition be in true sports man spirit.
May the best win.
I declare the 12th South Asian Games open.

Horizontally,we have to spread the benefits of development to regions and communities that have lagged behind.
The mantra of my Government has been Reform, Perform, Transform andfurther Perform.
We have taken a number of drasticsteps.
We have also undertaken deeper structural reforms which have added strengthto our economy and nation.
We will continue the pace and process of reforms and de-regulation.
We have made Doing Business Easier.
In the last four years, we have jumped 65places in the Global Ranking of World Bank’s Doing Business Report.
From 142 in 2014 to 77 now, butwe are still not satisfied.
The historic implementation of Goods and Services Tax and other measures of simplification and consolidation of taxes havereduced transaction costs andmade processes efficient.
We have also made Doing Business Faster through digital processes, online transactions and single point inter-faces.
In the last four years, we have received FDI worth 263 billion Dollars.
This is 45 percent of the FDI received in last 18 years.
And Friends, We have also made Doing Business Smarter.
Digital payments including direct transfer of government benefits is now under full implementation.
We are among the largest eco-systems in the world for start-ups and a number of them have come up in the field of technology.
We have a world class engineering education base and strong Research and Development facilities.
Rise in GDP, a rising middle class and their purchasing power is creating further growth in our huge domestic market.
Thus, from the start of business to its operation and closure, we have paid attention in building new institutions, processesand procedures.
All this is important, not just for doing business but also for ease of life of our people.
We also understand that being a young nation, we need to create job opportunities and better infrastructure.
Both are linked with investments.
Our focus also includes bringing our industrial infrastructure, policies and practices to best global standards and to convert India into a global manufacturing hub.
Cleaner energy and greener development.

Indian culture unaffected by servitude due to people like Vivekananda, Tagore: says PM Modi
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said that culture is the lifeblood of any nation as it gives identity to it.

This was possible due to the contribution of people like Gurudev Tagore and Swami Vivekananda, he added.

He called Tagore’s teachings timeless and said that the world stands to learn a great deal from his works.

Your Excellency, President Filipe Nyusi Ladies and Gentlemen,
Excellency, I am deeply touched by your kind words.
Thank you also for your thoughts on the strength of the Mozambique-India relationship.
I would like to thank you as well as the Government and the people of Mozambique for their warm welcome and generous hospitality.
Excellency, the relationship between our countries is not new.
Thousands of Indian-origin people call Mozambique their home.
I am told that most of the Siddi community that resides in parts of India is known to trace its ancestry to Mozambique.
These communitiesare a living testimony to age old links that have connected our people, their ideas and traditions, and culture and commerce.
Excellency, both our countries suffered under the colonial rule.
In the case of Mozambique, the struggle was much longer.
Independent India was one of the leading advocates of Mozambican freedom from colonial rule.
We were proud to see Mozambique join the ranks of free nations in 1975.
And, today, we applaud Mozambique as one of the fastest growing economies of the world in recent decades.
Excellency, as two developing countries we face similar challenges.
Our development and economic partnership, therefore, has been an essential part of our relationship.
This gap should never have been so long.
And, I am confident that it will not be so in future.
With these words, Excellencies, Ladies & Gentlemen, please join me in raising a toast: to the health, happiness and well-being of His Excellency, President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi; to lasting peace, progress and prosperity among the people of Mozambique; and to strong bonds of friendship and cooperation between India and Mozambique.

It is a great pleasure to meet you all.
It is an added pleasure to talk to you in the presence of an enlightened leader like Chancellor Merkel.
In fact, I do not miss any opportunity of meeting her.
I particularly recall my interactions during my visit to Hannover Fair in April 2015.
India was Partner Country in that fair.
This was followed by Chancellor Merkel’s visit to India in October 2015.
Together, we have had several rounds of discussion with German and Indian CEOs.
Today again, I can see lot of energy and enthusiasm in this hall.
I can also see a number of Indian CEOs present here.
Germany is among India’s most important partners both bilaterally and in the global context.
I am very happy to see participation of German companies in India’s growth story.
It is equally heartening to see that Indian companies have also made their presence felt in Germany.
Major sectors attracting FDI inflows from Germany are engineering, chemicals and services.
About 600 Indo-German joint ventures are presently operating in India.
They provide employment to around two hundred thousand people.
However, there is tremendous further potential in India-Germany economic collaboration.
Our economic partnership is still below its full potential.
To enhance this, we, in India, are ready with open arms to welcome German companies.
With a view to help the German companies, we have put in place a Fast Track Mechanism.
A number of issues have already been resolved through this mechanism.
We are doing it sincerely because we value German participation a lot.
We are on the path of making India a global manufacturing hub.
A vast pool of skilled professionals with knowledge and energy;
World class engineering education base and strong R&D facilities;
Rise in GDP and purchasing power creating further growth in the domestic market;
Due to these strengths, as said by UNIDO, India is already the 6th largest manufacturing nation in the world.
To make it better, we are working hard on various enablers.
Through our ‘Make in India’ initiative, we are committed to transform India as a major player in the global value chain.
Prime motive is creation of jobs and narrowing the gap between affluent and lower sections of society.
Make in India has already created a strong impact.
Germany is contributing in a big way in the success of Make in India.
Particularly, India’s participation as Partner country in the Hannover Fair has given a big boost to Indo-German partnership.
During the Hannover Messe, specific areas for collaboration were mutually identified.
This included manufacturing, skill development, railways, cleaning of rivers, renewable energy, education, science and technology.
In addition, we are also implementing a strategic market entry support Programme, since September 2015.
It is called MIIM (Make in India Mittelstand).
This is mainly to assist German Mittelstand Companies in entering the Indian Market.
The MIIM Programme has been offering a wide range of business support Services.
The initiative has resulted in growing interest of German companies in India.
The outcomes are that in this short period:
83 companies expressed interest to join the program;
73 Companies have enrolled as official members;
Over 500 Indian managers have benefited by this programme so far.
In addition, there is a good weather already existing.
Some examples are that:
Bosch, Siemens, BASF and SAP have started specific R&D operations exclusively in India
Mercedes Benz India inaugurated its second manufacturing facility in Chakan in July 2015.
This will double the plant capacity to 20,000 units per annum.
For our efforts, we have also received good global recognition.
I would like to mention some of them.
Our emphasis has been on reducing Govevrnment and enhancing Governance.
I would give some examples:
In the last two years, we have moved towards a low tax regime both on personal as well as corporate side;
Custom clearance has been made 24X7 at 19 ports and 17 air cargo complexes;
Incorporating a company along with allotment of DIN, PAN, TAN and the CIN is now just one day affair;
I will give you some examples:
Here, I am mentioning about some states but due to a sense of competition, the trend of reforms is spreading fast to all the states.
Reforms include –
100% implementation of single window system for payments & approvals in 16 states;
100% implementation of e-filing of tax returns in 13 states;
Automated online building plan approval in 13 states;
E-filing system for commercial disputes have been implemented in 11 states;
Specialized Commercial Courts have been established at District level in 13 states;
Now, India has one of the most liberal FDI Policy regimes in the world.
More than 90% of the foreign investment flows are under automatic route.
Last week we formally decided to abolish the Foreign Investment Promotion Board which was made in 1990s to examine the FDI proposals.
The idea is to expand the engagement of overseas investors in the Indian economy.
Due to this approach, Our FDI Outlook has been ranked highly positive by various International Agencies.
There has also been tremendous growth in the FDI inflows in the last 3 years and has now reached to 60 billion US Dollars in 2016-17.
India is a big country.
Hence, nothing is enough when it comes to development.
We have many dreams.
And the dreams are big.
But we have small timelines.
And this is your opportunity.
These opportunities range from building millions of houses to setting up hundreds of smart cities; modernization of railway networks and stations to setting up of high speed rail corridors; generation of renewable energy to construction of transmission and distribution networks.
In addition, there is an ever growing need for National Highways, Bridges, and Mass Urban Transport systems, schools, hospitals and skill training institutes.
We are trying to empower our people to realise this potential through our campaigns like Digital India and Skill India.
To tap the youth energy fully, we have launched the Start up India and Stand up India Campaigns.
Chancellor Merkel and Friends!
When I spoke in April 2015, our process of reform had just started.
Now, I can safely say that we have completed a sizeable part of it.
However, we are committed to do more and more; in a faster and better manner.
I strongly believe that we should create institutional networks to understand and advocate such reforms.
This is necessary to leverage the underlying economic potential of our two countries.
At the end, I invite more and more German colleagues and companies to India.
Our direction, desire and dreams create tremendous business opportunity.
Never before, India was so much ready for business.
We are on a take off stage.
Moreover, our democratic values and an alert judicial system will ensure the safety of your investments.
I assure you that we will work hand in hand with you to make your efforts successful.

Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a voice of influence in the world of finance,Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of Monetary Authority of Singapore, a leading institution in fintech,Tens of thousands of participants from over one hundred countries,
It is a great honour to be the first Head of Government to deliver the keynote address at Singapore Fintech Festival.
This is a tribute to the youth of India with its eyes firmly fixed to the future.
It is an acknowledgement of the financial revolution sweeping through India and transforming the lives of 1.3 billion people.
This is the season of the Indian Festival of Lights – Deepawali.
It is celebrated all over the world as a victory of virtue, hope, knowledge and prosperity.
The Diwali lights are still on in Singapore.
The Fintech Festival is also a celebration of belief.
Belief in the spirit of innovation and the power of imagination.
Belief in the energy of youth and their passion for change.
Belief in making the world a better place.
And, it is no surprise that in just its third year, this Festival is already the world’s largest.
It was here, in June this year, that I launched India’s RuPay card and the first international remittance mobile app using India’s world class Unified Payment Interface or UPI.
The character of the global economy is changing.
Technology is defining competitiveness and power in the new world.
And, it is creating boundless opportunities to transform lives.
I had said at the United Nations in 2014 that we have to believe that development and empowerment can spread with the same speed at which Facebook, Twitter or mobile phones have spread.
To begin with financial inclusion has become a reality for 1.3 billion Indians.
We have generated more than 1.2 billion biometric identities – called Aadhaar or foundation – in just a few years.
With our Jan DhanYojana, we aimed to give a bank account to every Indian.
Less than 50 percent of Indians had bank accounts in 2014; now, it is nearly universal.
So today, more than a billion biometric identities, more than a billion bank accounts and more than a billion cell phones give India by far the biggest public infrastructure in the world.
More than Rupees 3.6 lakh crore, or 50 billion dollars of benefits from government have reached the people directly.
No longer must a poor citizen in a remote village travel long distances or pay off middle-men to get her rights.
No longer can fake and duplicate accounts bleed government finances.
A student can get her scholarship directly into her account.
No longer will she be lost in end-less paper chase.
Banking has come to doorsteps even in remote villages through 400,000 micro ATMs based on Aadhaar.
And now, this digital infrastructure has helped launch the world’s largest healthcare scheme this year.
‘Ayushman’ will provide affordable health insurance to 500 million Indians.
It has also helped us extend 145 million loans for small entrepreneurs through Mudra scheme.
In four years, they amount to Rupees 6.5 lakh crore, or 90 billion dollars.
Nearly 75 percent of these loans have gone to women.
Just a few weeks ago, we launched the India Post Payments Bank.
They give our farmers better access to land records, credit, insurance, market and the best price.
They deliver health services and hygiene products to women.
None of this would have been as effective without the other big change brought about by fintech – the digitisation of payments and transactions in India.
For those with mobile and internet, the BHIM-UPI is the world’s most sophisticated, simpleand seamless platform for payments between accounts, using a virtual payment address.
For those who have a mobile, but no internet, there is U.S.S.D. system in 12 languages.
And, for those who have neither mobile nor internet, there is Aadhar Enabled Payment System, which uses biometrics.
And, it has already registered a billion transactions and grown six-fold in two years.
From cards to QRs and wallets, digital transactions in India are growing rapidly.
Today, 128 banks in India are connected to UPI.
Transactions on UPI grew 1500 times in the last 24 months.
Every month, the value of transaction is growing by over 30 percent.
But, more than the pace, I am inspired by the opportunities, efficiency, transparency and convenience that digital payment is generating.
A shopkeeper can go online to reduce his inventory and speed up collections.
For a fruit grower, a farmer or a rural artisan , the markets are direct and closer, earnings are higher,and payments are faster.
A worker collects wages or remits money home quickly without giving up a day’s work.
Every digital payment saves time.
It adds to a huge national saving.
It is increasing productivity of individuals and our economy.
It also helps improve tax collection and inject fairness in the economy.
Even more, digital payments are a gateway to a world of possibilities.
Financial inclusion also extends to micro, small and medium enterprises.
They are all coming on the nation-wide Goods and Services Tax digital network, launched just over a year ago.
Banks are reaching out to them with credit.
Alternative lending platforms are offering innovative financing models.
They no longer have to look at informal markets for credit at high interest rates.
It has turned India into a leading fintech and Startup nation in the world.
The future of fintech and Industry 4.0 is emerging in India.
Our youth are developing apps that are making the dream of paperless, cashless, presence-less, and yet safe and secure, transactions possible for all.
That is the wonder of India Stack– simply the largest set of Application Programming Interface in the world.
They are using Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and machine learning to create solutions for banks, regulators and consumers.
And, they are also embracing our nation’s social missions – from health and education to micro credit and insurance.
This enormous talent pool in India benefits from the ecosystem created by initiatives such as Digital India and Startup India, and by supportive policies, incentives and funding programmes.
So, I say this to all the fintech companies and startups – India is your best destination.
The economies of scale achieved in India by the LED bulb industry allowed this energy efficient technology to become more affordable globally.
Across the world, from the Indo-Pacific to Africa to Latin America, we see inspiring stories of extraordinary innovation changing ordinary lives .
But, there is much to be done.
Our focus should be development of all, through , that is, development of the most marginalised.
We must bring the unbanked 1.7 billion people in the world into the formal financial market.
We must extend the security of insurance and pension to more than a billion workers in the informal sectors worldwide, who still do not have it.
We can use fintech to ensure that no dream remains unfulfilled, and no enterprise remains still born, because of lack of access to finance.
We must make banks and financial institutions more resilient in managing risks,fighting frauds and dealing with disruption of traditional models.
We have to use technology to improve compliance,regulation and supervision, so that innovation flourishes and risks are contained.
We must use fintech tools to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.
The emerging world of finance will succeed in our inter-connected world when our data and systems are trusted and secure.
We have to make our globally wired system safe from cyber threats.
We must also ensure that the pace and the push of Fintech work to the advantage of the people, not to their disadvantage; that technology in finance ensures improvement of the human condition through direct contact with the most marginalized.
We also need to enhance awareness of the masses and educate them about the opportunities which inclusive policies and use of technology open up for them.
For this,fintech will need to be not merely a mechanism but a movement.
And, we have to address the inevitable questions of data ownership and flow, privacy and consent; private and public good; law and ethics.
Finally, we must invest in creating skills for the future.
And, be prepared to back ideas and invest for the long term.
Each era is defined by its opportunities and challenges.Each generation has its responsibility to shape future.
This generation will shape the futurein the palm of every hand in the world.
Just as India will learn from others, we will share our experience and expertise with the world.
Because,what drives India also holds hope for others.
And,what we dream for India is what we also wish for the world.

The guidelines provide for advance preparatory action to be taken by administrative Ministry/ Department and CPSEs, preparation of closure proposal, settlement of statutory and other liabilities of the CPSE under closure and modalities for disposal of movable and immovable assets of such CPSEs in a time bound manner.
The guidelines give first priority for utilization of land of CPSEs under closure for Affordable Housing as per the relevant guidelines of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
Since there are employees working in these CPSEs, Government decided that closure should not cause hardship to them and has now laid down a uniform policy to give workers VRS at 2007 notional pay scale irrespective of the pay scale in which they are working.
These guidelines shall apply to all sick/ loss making CPSEs, where –
1. Approval/ in principle approval for closure has been obtained by administrative Ministry/ Department from the CCEA/ Cabinet; or
2. the process for obtaining the approval of the competent authority is underway after the administrative Ministry/ Department has decided for the closure of the CPSE.
By assigning priority to Affordable Housing it would make available land parcels of sick/loss making CPSEs under closure for the Government flagship programme of Affordable Housing being managed by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

To this end, President and I agreed to work together for the safety and security of our people.
And, actively cooperate to combat the common challenges of terrorism and insurgent activity in our region.
Its extent and depth is shaped by a robust development cooperation partnership, which has a strong “people first” philosophy.

And, do so as per the priorities of the Myanmar Government.
Culture is a key centrality in the foundation of our ties.
I am happy that our partnership is restoring Ananda temple in Bagan in Myanmar.

Your visit has been most timely.
And, our discussions today have enabled us to evolve a road map and an action agenda for our cooperation.

I am delighted to be in Madurai, famous for Minakshi-Sundareshwara Temple and a place that owes its name to the auspicious blessings of Lord Shiva.
The Country celebrated Republic Day yesterday.
In some ways, the laying of foundation stone of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Madurai today reflects our vision of “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat”.
We all know that AIIMS in Delhi has cultivated a brand name for itself in health care.
With AIIMS in Madurai, we can say that this brand of health care has been taken to all corners of the country – from Kanyakumari to Kashmir to Madurai; and from Guwahati to Gujarat.
AIIMS at Madurai will be constructed at a cost of more than rupees sixteen hundred crores.
It will benefit the entire population of Tamil Nadu.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, we have supported up gradation of Government Medical Colleges across India.
The speed and scale at which Mission Indradhanush is working is setting a new paradigm in preventive healthcare.
Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan is making safe pregnancy a mass movement.
The number of under-graduate medical seats have been increased by almost 30 percent in the last 4 and half years.
The launch of Ayushman Bharat is also a big step.
It is a carefully thought out approach to ensure achievement of universal health coverage for our country.
Ayushman Bharat seeks to undertake path breaking interventions to holistically address health issues.
One Point Five lakh Health & Wellness Centres are being set up to provide comprehensive primary care and preventive health services.
Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana provides financial protection upto Rupees 5 lakh per family per year to over 10 crore needy families in case of hospitalization.
It is the largest Health Insurance Scheme in the world.

I am also happy to learn that Tamil Nadu has already started one thousand three hundred and twenty Health & Wellness Centres.
Today I am also happy to dedicate 12 Post Office Passport Sewa Kendras in Tamil Nadu.
This initiative is one more example of improving the “ease of living” to our citizens.
I once again assure that my government is committed to strengthen the initiatives in health care to ensure universal health coverage.

The MoU will help in promoting exchange of ideas, values and culture amongst all youth irrespective of their caste, religion and gender as well as development of sports in the two countries.
In turn, it will help in consolidating friendly relations between the two countries.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his fifth interaction through PRAGATI – the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation.
In course of his review today, the Prime Minister expressed concern at the grievances relating to post offices.

The very word “Japan” in India is a benchmark of quality, excellence, honesty and integrity.
That is why India and Japan are best suited to work together.
Our past has desired us to stand together.
Asia has emerged as the new centre of global growth.
India and Japan will have to continue to play a major role in Asia’s emergence.
The growing convergence of views between Japan and India under our Special Strategic and Global Partnership has the capacity to drive the regional economy and development, and stimulate the global growth.
Strong India – Strong Japan will not only enrich our two nations.
It will also be a stabilising factor in Asia and the world.
Today, every global company has an India strategy.
And, Japanese companies are no exception.
For this, we will be proactive in addressing your concerns.
And, we will further strengthen the special mechanisms including Japanese Industrial Townships.
I encourage you to make use of the ten-year business visa, the e-Tourist Visa, and the Visa-On-Arrival facility that we now offer to Japanese travellers.
The Social Security Agreement with Japan has also been implemented, which is good news for the growing number of professionals on both sides.
· We want to explore minerals and hydrocarbons in a greener way;
· We want to build homes and civic amenities in a smarter way; and
· We want to produce energy in a cleaner way.
In addition, there are futuristic infrastructure projects of second generation.
These include: the Dedicated Freight Corridor, the Industrial Corridors, High Speed Railways, Smart Cities, Coastal Zones and Metro Rail projects.
E-governance is no longer just a fancy buzzword, but a basic facility.
We have successfully enacted a new legislation regarding Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code passed recently will make it easier for investors to have an exit.
My resolve is to make India the most open economy in the world.
· India has gone up 19 spots on the World Logistics Performance Index 2016 brought out by the World Bank.
· We have done substantial improvement on Ease of doing business.
Our ranking has improved considerably.
I have long maintained that India needs scale, speed and skill.
Japan has a very important role to play in all three.
With a number of skill development initiatives already underway, our partnership now extends to this crucial area of our priority.
The captains of Japanese business and industry sitting here will agree with me that a combination of Japan’s technologies and India’s human resources will create a win-win situation.
Let us march forward and explore bigger potentials and brighter prospects.
India, today took another major step in the fight against tax evasion, “round tripping” and “base erosion/profit shifting”.
This step follows the recent amendment of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with Mauritius.
As in the case of Mauritius, the treaty with Cyprus had provided for residence-based taxation of capital gains.
In other words, India will have the right to tax capital gains arising in India.
The provisions in the earlier treaty for residence-based taxation were leading to distortion of financial and real investment flows by artificial diversion of various investments from their true countries of origin, for the sake of avoiding tax.
As in the case of Mauritius, this amendment will deter such activities.
Negotiations with Singapore are also underway for similar changes.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I am happy to be with you on my first visit to Kenya as Prime Minister.
Indians in general, and Gujaratis in particular, have had their second home in Kenya.
So, from that perspective, I am really late in visiting this great country.
There has been a long gap of nearly 35 years for the visit of Indian Prime Minister.
Though at a personal level, I was able to maintain engagements with Kenya.
As Chief Minister of Gujarat, I visited Kenya in 2008.
We also received delegations in Gujarat from here.
At the outset, I must compliment the people and leadership of Kenya for overall development and stability since independence.
Kenya’s economy and its infrastructure make it an influential player in the region.
You are the only developing country which hosts the headquarters of UN agencies.
India and Kenya are blessed by sufficient solar radiation.
Solar energy is a real solution for global warming.
It is also a good strategy for providing electricity to remote villages and hamlets.
We look forward to work together on this front under the International Solar Alliance.
Similarly, health sector is another area of great interest to both sides.
We are happy that thousands of Kenyan patients have returned from India after a successful treatment.
I understand that Kenya would like to replicate the Indian experience in Medicare and become a medical hub in the region.
We would be happy to support you in this process.
These are just a few indicators of the depth of our relationship and the potentials for co-operation.
Like Kenya, India is also a young country.
Your workforce is sought after in Africa.
Similarly, the Indian work force is sought after in the entire world.
We can do a lot together to nurture and train this human capital which can serve the whole world.
Today, India is the fastest growing large economy of the world.
We are not only having a high growth rate; we are also going up in various global indicators.
India has changed a lot in last two years.
We are now the most preferred destination for FDI.
In the year of 2015, we have received highest ever FDI.
And for you the good news is that India is the largest trading partner of Kenya.
India is also the second largest investor here.
We will be happy to further remove the imbalance in trade between us.
We will also be happy to enhance the level of investment in Kenya.
I am here to assure the people and Government of Kenya that India stands by you.
Our friendship is only a win-win game.
Whether it is Kenyan students in India; or Indian professionals in Kenya- both should shine.
Whether it is mines, minerals or machines; all are rewarding areas.
We should jointly explore the opportunities.
Various initiatives during my visit including this meeting are indicators in that direction.
I assure Kenya that India will always work to strengthen your processes and enrich your resources.
It is my pleasure to present the book to His Excellency the President of Kenya.
Your Excellency Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Members of the media,
India admires the success of your people in overcoming adversity to advance, innovate and flourish against all odds.
I am honoured to be in Israel on this extra-ordinary visit.
In our modern journey, our paths have been different, but our belief in democratic values and economic progress has been a shared pursuit.
This visit is an occasion:
• to rejuvenate the bonds of our friendship;
• to compose a new chapter in our ties; and
• to jointly venture towards new horizons of engagement.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have had productive discussions covering an extensive menu of issues.
Not just on areas of bilateral opportunities.
But, also how our cooperation can help the cause of global peace and stability.
Israel is among the leading nations in the field of innovation, water and agricultural technology.
These are also among my priority areas in India’s development.
We are of one view that together our scientists and researchers would develop, build and implement mutually beneficial solutions in the field.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I agreed on the need to do more in this direction.
Businesses on both sides should take primary lead in such efforts.
This would also be our message to the CEO Forum tomorrow.
India and Israel live in complex geographies.
We are aware of strategic threats to regional peace and stability.
India has suffered firsthand the violence and hatred spread by terror.
So has Israel.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I agreed to do much more together to protect our strategic interests and also cooperate to combat growing radicalization and terrorism, including in cyber space.
We also discussed the situation in West Asia and wider region.
It is India’s hope that peace, dialogue, and restraint will prevail.
Our people hold natural affinity and warmth for each other.
The Indian-origin Jewish community reminds us of these bonds.
It also serves as a bridge to a shared future.
In recent years, we have been receiving a large number of Israeli tourists in India.
At the same time, more and more Indian students are choosing to pursue advance academics and research in your best universities.
I am confident that the strength of these links, old and new, will hold us in good stead as we forge a partnership for the 21st century.
Around 150 kilometers from here, there is a slice of history in the city of Haifa in Israel that is very dear to my country.
This is the final resting place for forty-four of the Indian soldiers who sacrificed their lives during World War 1 to liberate that city.
Excellency Netanyahu,
It has been a productive and memorable twenty-four hours in Israel.
I am sure that the rest of my stay would be equally exciting.
Let me also take this chance to invite you and Mrs. Netanyahu and your family to visit India.
President of Brazil Ms. Dilma Rousseff, Chancellor of Germany Ms. Angela Merkel and Prime Minister of Japan Mr. Shinzo Abe were also present.
In his opening remarks at the meeting, the Prime Minister said: “We live in a digital age.
Yet, our institutions, approaches, and often mindsets, reflect the wisdom of the century we have left behind, not the century we live in.
This is especially true of the United Nations Security Council.
The reform of the Security Council within a fixed time frame has become an urgent and important task.”
The Joint Statement issued at the end of the meeting stated: “The G-4 leaders stressed that a more representative, legitimate and effective Security Council is needed more than ever to address the global conflicts and crises, which had spiralled in recent years.
They shared the view that this can be achieved by reflecting the realities of the international community in the 21st century, where more Member States have the capacity and willingness to take on major responsibilities with regard to maintenance of international peace and security.”
He met various members of the Indian community.
Visit to Tesla Motors.
The Prime Minister visited the factory floor.
Meeting with IT CEOs, Digital India address.
The Prime Minister met Mr. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc., who mentioned that India has a special place for the company, as Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc., went to India for inspiration.
The Prime Minister, in his address at this event, outlined his vision for Digital India.
This is what sets us apart from the century that we have just left behind.
There may be still some who see the digital economy as the tool of the rich, educated and the privileged.
But, ask the taxi driver or the corner vendor in India what he has gained from his cell phone, and the debate gets settled.
I see technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity.
Social media is reducing social barriers.
It connects people on the strength of human values, not identities.
Today, technology is advancing citizen empowerment and democracy that once drew their strength from Constitutions.
Technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses, not in 24 hours but in 24 minutes.
When you think of the exponential speed and scale of expansion of social media or a service, you have to believe that it is equally possible to rapidly transform the lives of those who have long stood on the margins of hope.
So, friends out of this conviction was born the vision of Digital India.
It is an enterprise for India’s transformation on a scale that is, perhaps, unmatched in human history.
Delegation of leaders from J&K Opposition Parties meets PM
They gave an overview of the vast growth potential of the media and entertainment industry in India, and said that this sector is poised to contribute in a significant way towards this goal.

Members of the delegation strongly called for the development of Mumbai as the global entertainment capital, through various initiatives and proactive approaches.
The business leaders expressed their desire to prepare a roadmap to achieve the target of $ 500 billion in bilateral trade and expand meaningfully their CSR activities in India.
Interacting with the members, the Prime Minister mentioned various reforms undertaken by the Government of India.
He also spoke of the enormous investment potential in India, and encouraged the American investor community to step up investment in the country.
Mentioning the shared values between India and the US, he also called for greater people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.
He said that the event reminds us of the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom, and the responsibility that this places on all of us.
The Prime Minister said that the fact that people from humble, rural background, today occupy the highest positions in India, shows the maturity of Indian democracy, and the strength of India’s Constitution.
Your Excellency, President Johann Schneider-Ammann,
Thank you, Excellency, for your warm remarks and generous welcome.
I feel the weight of history, standing here with you in this truly international city-Geneva.
And, not just international, but a city with a humanitarian soul.
After all, it is home to the “Red Cross”, and headquarters of several international organizations devoted to serving mankind.
India and Switzerland have both been the voices of peace, understanding and humanitarian values in the world.
In last seven decades, our friendship has consistently seen an upward trajectory.
Today, President and I reviewed our multifaceted bilateral ties.
We also held detailed discussions with Swiss CEOs.
We are all aware of the strengths of the Swiss economy.
But, India too is undergoing profound transformations.
We are today the fastest growing economy in the world.
But, that alone is not enough.
I want the Indian economy to be driven by smart and sustainable cities, robust farm sector, vibrant manufacturing and dynamic service sector.
And, its engines to run on world class network of rail, roads, airports and digital connectivity.
Where a home for everyone, and electricity in every home is a reality.
And, its 500 million plus youth is skilled and ready to meet the global needs of manpower.
We see a perfect connect between our development needs and Swiss strengths.
I, therefore, invite the Swiss companies to avail of this great opportunity to be a key partner in India’s economic growth.
Ultimately, the economic prosperity of 1.25 billion plus would also benefit the entire world.
India and Switzerland also share a commitment to reform international institutions in line with current global realities.
We have both agreed to support each other for our respective bids for the non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
I am also thankful to the President for Switzerland’s understanding and support for India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Combating the menace of “black money” and tax evasion is also our shared priority.
We discussed the need for an early and expeditious exchange of information to bring to justice the tax offenders.
An early start to negotiations on the Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information would be important in this respect.
Strong ties between the people of our two countries are an important base and benchmark of our linkages.
Thanks to the Indian film industry, we are very familiar with the enchanting beauty of the Swiss landscapes.
There are many success stories of our relationship.
One that has been making waves in the Grand Slams of the tennis world is the partnership of famous Swiss player Martina Hingis with Sania Mirza and Leander Paes of India.
I am confident that our common commitments and values, people to people links and a strong and growing economic partnership will take our relations to new heights.
I thank you, Excellency, once again for hosting me in Geneva.
The Prime Minister emphasized that the Union Government will never allow the poor and the middle class to be looted.
He urged the assembled people to download the BHIM App for cashless transactions.
“CPA Canada” Institute is the national organization established to support a unified Canadian accounting profession.
Dear brothers and sisters,
I am personally pained at the developments.
Violence cannot provide a solution to any problem.
In a democracy, solutions are found through restraint and mutual dialogue.
This dispute can only be solved within the legal ambit.
Breaking the law is not a viable alternative.
The violence and arson seen in the last two days is only causing loss to the poor, and to our nation’s property.
Whenever the country has faced adverse circumstances, the people of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, just like people across the country, have always handled the situation with sensitivity.
I appeal to the people of the two States, to display sensitivity, and also keep in mind their civic responsibilities.
I trust you will keep national interest and nation building above all else, and give priority to restraint, harmony, and finding a solution, eschewing violence, destruction and arson.
This is the eighth interaction in the series by the Prime Minister through video conference with various beneficiaries of Government schemes.
Expressing happiness in interacting with people who fought adversities and emerged much stronger, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said that Social security schemes empower people.
He added that these social security schemes of the present Government not only help people effectively deal with the uncertainties of life, but also empower them to rise over the financially difficult situations of the family.
Prime Minister outlined the various aspects pursued by the Government to ensure financial security for the poor and the vulnerable.
They are – opening the doors of the banks for the poor- banking the unbanked; ensuring access to capital for small business and budding entrepreneurs- funding the unfunded and; providing social security cover for the poor and vulnerable – financially securing the unsecured.
Interacting with beneficiaries Prime Minister said that the total number of 28 crore bank accounts opened under Pradhan MantriJan DhanYojana during the period 2014 – 2017 is nearly 55% of the total bank accounts opened in the world.
He also expressed happiness that more women have bank accounts in India now and that number of bank accounts in India has reached 80% from 53% in 2014.
Listening to the adversities faced by people, Prime Minister said that even though the loss of a person can never be compensated, the Government has always strived to ensure economic security to the affected family.
He said thatmore than five crore people have benefitted from Pradhan MantriJeevanJyoti Yojana, by paying a very low premium of around Rs. 300.

Troubled families, harassed students, tense teachers – one sees a very strange psychological atmosphere prevailing in each home!
When I’d declared that I would talk on this topic, many teachers, guardians and students sent me their messages, questions, suggestions and also expressed their anguish and narrated their problems.
You too listen to what Srishti has to say: –
“Sir, I want to tell you that during exam time, very often in our homes, in the neighbourhood and in our society, a very terrifying and scary atmosphere pervades.
So I just want to ask you this, can’t this be transformed into a pleasant atmosphere?”
And therefore I shall say to you ‘Smile More Score More’!
You must have seen for yourself that during the examinations also, you’re able to recall everything else – the book, the chapter, the page number, whether what you want is there on the top of the page or at its bottom, you can recall everything but not the particular word you want to.
And thus success and failure in life is not determined at all by how one has done at the examination; this is a burden from which you must free yourself.
We all have before us the extremely inspiring example of our former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
One Richa Anand Ji has sent me this question: –
“Today what I see as the biggest challenge facing the education is that it has come to focus solely on examinations.
Life truly goes on in terms of whether whatever you have learned, you have tried to live that also!
If you will have faith in these things, then marks will automatically follow you and you will never have to chase marks!
When you have to fight a big law suit and you go to a lawyer to engage his services, do you look at the mark-sheet of that lawyer?
But that does not mean that I’m implying that you don’t have to study at all.
Richa Ji had also mentioned about ‘PRATISPARDHA’, meaning ‘competition with others’.
In reality, it is not the competition with others that takes us ahead in life but it is competing with ourselves or ‘ANUSPARDHA’, which takes our life forward.
If you couldn’t wake up at the decided time in the morning and were thus delayed, now can you get up early on time?
Therefore I urge you to engage in ‘Anuspardha’, or ‘competition with self’.
And you’ll witness for yourself the positive change that it will bring about in you.
He further writes, “My mother was not educated.
She would then compare answers and thus be of great help to me.
My mother did not clear the Class 10 exam, yet without her aid, it would have been impossible for me to pass the CBSE exam.”
Former M.P. Purushottam Mavlankar, son of India’s first Lok Sabha Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavlankar, had come to the hospital to see him.
Moreover, when I tried to use unfair means to pass the exam, I got caught and a lot of my friends around me also had to undergo distress because of me.”
There are times when not having enough confidence in oneself makes one crave to peep into a fellow student’s answer sheet, may be just to confirm if one has written the correct answer.
Look at the scourge of cheating, copying and such unfair means from any angle and in any form; it is surely going to drag you into the abyss of failure in life.
Where will you reach then?
If someone says, “Let me finish with all exams first, I will play and do other things later”; well, that is impossible.
A relaxed body equally relaxes your mental organs.
It will help you avoid wastage of study time; it will enhance your ability to study well.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the people on the occasion of various festivals across India.

“Deeply saddened at the passing away of Selvi Jayalalithaa.
Her demise has left a huge void in Indian politics.
I will always cherish the innumerable occasions when I had the opportunity to interact with Jayalalithaa ji.
I am particularly delighted to be at the Gujarat Forensic Sciences University.
This university and the students studying here are pioneers.
This is not a university that offers courses that are more talked about.
Instead, the focus area is specific.
Your road to Gandhinagar would not have been an easy one.
When you planned to come here, I am sure people asked you are you sure, you want to do this?
Are you watching too many crime related TV shows?
Or, are you reading too many Agatha Christie or Feluda books?
Yet, you persisted and selected a stream that is conventionally believed to be unconventional but highly important for today’s age.
This shows that you not only believe in yourself but also are blessed with the power of determination to pursue your own dreams.
This trait will always help you in the times to come.
Friends, It is a matter of pride that in a short time, GFSU has achieved such a bench-mark of academic excellence that the National Assessment and Accreditation Council has awarded this University an ‘A’ Grade.
I am glad that GFSU is among very few universities in India, to achieve this immediately after establishment.
Friends, criminals and ways of committing crime are constantly changing.
In order to deal with rapidly changing crime scenario, you also have to develop newer techniques to make it clear that criminals will not be spared.
DNA profiling has established new dimensions in forensic investigation.
With the help of this technology, many such cases have been resolved which would otherwise remain unsolved.
I call upon forensic experts to help the judicial system by using DNA profiling as much as possible so that culprit get punished immediately and the victims get justice.
Looking at the importance of DNA technology in forensic investigation, our government has approved the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2018.
Through this bill, we will ensure that all DNA tests remain reliable and the data is safe.
The Government has also decided to strengthen DNA analysis labs in all the States and Union Territories.
A State of the Art lab under the Nirbhaya scheme is being established at Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh.
The first step towards manifesting this strength is to believe.
Believe in yourself.
Believe in your abilities.
Believe in your potential.
Locard taught you that the perpetrator of a crime will bring something into the crime scene and leave with something from it.
I am sure you will always be solving crimes.
But, do remember that each one of you students brings great value to our society as well.
And, while adding value, do not forget to also learn from others.
Keep your mind open to new ideas, views and opinions.
Enrich the world with your thoughts and absorb the best that others have to offer.
This diversity is what will make you a richer person.
And, when I say Law of Progressive Change, while your mind would naturally go back to what you were taught, also think about the times to come.
We live in a world that is rapidly changing in every sense.
Cutting edge innovation is the corner-stone of our times.
It does not take much time for a new idea to become old.
People, and youngsters in particular are coming out with out of the box solutions in record time.
Likewise, you too must be at the centre of the changing trends across the globe.
Your education and intelligence has trained you to think out of the box.
Ensure that you use these skills not only to keep pace with the changes around us but also to drive some of the progressive changes that make our world a better place.
Generations to come will thank you for it.
Friends, no scheme or initiative can be successful without the participation of youth.
I am confident that the knowledge you have gained here will help you serve the country effectively and achieve professional success.
I hope you shall continue to hold your Alma Mater in the highest esteem.
I wish all the graduating students a bright and vibrant future.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has expressed deep sympathy towards the affected people, on 5th anniversary of Great East Japan Earthquake.

I am delighted to be here in Nairobi.
In a way, the journey of your life has also been the journey of an Independent Kenya.
It is an honour for me to be with you today.
Kenya is a valued friend and trusted partner of India.
The bonds between the two countries are long-standing and rich.
We share a common legacy of struggle against colonialism.
And, today, President and I reviewed all aspects and full range of our relationship.
And, Kenya is a land of strong opportunities.
India is Kenya’s largest trading partner, and the second largest investor here.
But, there is potential to achieve much more.
President and I agreed that our economies can benefit more:
• If we nurture greater intensity of commercial links; • Take steps towards a more diversified trade basket; and • Expand our investment ties further.
This would also enable greater regional economic prosperity.
India and Kenya are two developing countries.
We are also two innovation societies.
The success of M-Pesa is one such classic innovation that has empowered millions the world over.
The multifaceted development partnership is a key pillar of our bilateral relationship.
We look forward to early implementation of the Indian lines of credit for projects in agricultural mechanization, textiles and the development of the small and medium sector.
This would not only meet the needs of your society.
It could also help Kenya become a regional medical hub.
In this regard, I am happy that the prestigious Kenyatta National Hospital will soon have the state of the art made in India cancer therapy machine – Bhabhatron.
We are also donating essential medicines and medical equipment for Kenya’s public health system, including for the treatment AIDS.
We recognize that without the opportunities for the success of our youth, our societies cannot grow.
For this, we are ready to partner with Kenya in the fields of education, vocational education and skill development.
As such, our closer cooperation in the field of maritime security occupies an important place in our overall defence and security engagement.
The MoU on Defence Cooperation signed just now would strengthen our institutional cooperation between our defence establishments.
This would include greater staff exchanges; sharing of expertise and experiences; training and institution building, cooperation in hydrography, and supply of equipment.
President and I recognize that Terrorism and the rapid spread of radical ideologies pose a common challenge to our people, our countries, to the region and to the whole world.
We have agreed to deepen our security partnership including in the fields of cyber security, combating drugs and narcotics, and human trafficking.
Yesterday, President and I had an unforgettable interaction with the Indian diaspora in Kenya.
As President Uhuru said, they are proud Kenyans even as they cherish their Indian roots.
As we shape deeper contacts between our economies and societies, they form a trusted bond and a strong bridge.
I am also happy to announce that the vibrant Indian culture, which is already a part of Kenya’s rich society, will be showcased in a Festival of India in Kenya later this year.
In the end, let me once again thank you, the Government of Kenya and its people for the warmest of welcomes that I have received.
And, I and the people of India look forward to welcoming you in India.
Thank you very much..

We are building roads, airports, rail lines and ports at a quick pace.
Our goods are on the Move.
The Goods and Services Tax has helped us rationalize supply chains and warehouse networks.
Our reforms are on the Move.
We have made India an easier place to do business.
Our lives are on the Move.
Families are getting homes, toilets, smoke-free LPG cylinders, bank accounts and loans.
Our youth are on the Move.
We are fast emerging as the start-up hub of the world.
India is moving ahead with new energy, urgency and purpose
It is already a major employer and can create the next generation of jobs.
Mobility is central to urbanization.
Motorized personal vehicles require ever-growing road, parking, and traffic infrastructure.
Mobility is critical to preserving our planet.
Road transport accounts for one fifth of global Carbon dioxide emissions.
This threatens to choke cities and raise global temperatures.
Creating a mobility eco-system that is in sync with nature is the need of the hour.
Mobility is the next frontier in our fight against Climate Change.
Better mobility can provide for better jobs, smarter infrastructure, and improve the quality of life.
It can also reduce costs, expand economic activity and protect the planet.
Thus, the mobility sector impacts larger public outcomes.
Mobility, especially the digitization of mobility, is disruptive.
It has big potential for innovation and it has been setting a searing pace!
Already, people are calling taxis on their phones, sharing bicycles in cities; buses are running on clean energy, cars are going electric.
In India, we have been laying emphasis on mobility.
We have doubled our pace of construction of highways.
We have re-energized our rural road-building programme.
We are promoting fuel efficient and cleaner fuel vehicles.
We have developed low-cost air connectivity in under-served regions.
We are also starting operations on hundreds of new air routes.
We are pushing waterways in addition to traditional modes like rail and road.
We are reducing travel distances in our cities by efficient location of homes, schools and offices.
We have also started data-driven interventions such as intelligent traffic management systems.
Our starting point is fresh.
Thus, we do not carry much of the baggage of other economies that were built on the back of private car ownership!
This gives us the window of opportunity to create an all-new, seamless mobility eco-system.
Our unique identity program, Aadhaar, and its India-stack eco-system, has laid down a comprehensive public digital infrastructure.
It has digitally empowered 850 million of our citizens.
India can demonstrate how such digital infrastructure can be combined with new mobility business models.
Our renewable energy push will ensure that the environmental benefits of electric mobility can be fully realized.
We are also the sixth largest producer of renewable energy.
We have also championed the cause of solar energy globally through the International Solar Alliance.
We have a fast growing manufacturing base, especially in the automotive sector.
We also have a large, digitally literate, young population.
This provides millions of educated minds, skilled hands and aspirational dreams for powering the future.
1. Common: Public Transport must be the cornerstone of our mobility initiatives.
New business models driven by digitization, are re-inventing the current paradigm.
Big Data is enabling smarter decision-making by better understanding our patterns and needs.
Our focus must also go beyond cars, to other vehicles such as scooters and rickshaws.
Large segments of the developing world depend on these vehicles for mobility.
2. Connected mobility implies integration of geographies as well as modes of transport.
The internet-enabled Connected Sharing Economy is emerging as the fulcrum of mobility.
We must leverage the full potential for vehicle pooling and other innovative technical solutions to improve private vehicle utilization.
People from villages should be able to bring their produce to the cities with ease and efficiency.
3. Convenient mobility means safe, affordable and accessible for all sections of the society.
This includes the elderly, the women and the specially abled.
We need to ensure that public transport is preferred to private modes of travel.
4. Congestion free mobility is critical to check the economic and environment costs of congestion.
Hence, there should be emphasis on ending bottlenecks of networks.
This would result in fewer traffic jams and lower levels of stress for people travelling.
It would also lead to greater efficiency in logistics and freight.
5. Charged mobility is the way forward.
We want to drive investments across the value chain from batteries to smart charging to Electric Vehicle manufacturing.
India’s business leaders and manufacturers are now poised to develop and deploy break-through battery technology.
The India Space Research Organization uses one of the best battery systems to run satellites in space.
Other institutions can partner with ISRO to develop cost effective and efficient battery systems for electric cars.
We want to build India as a driver in Electric Vehicles.
We will soon put in place a stable policy-regime around electric and other alternative fuel vehicles.
Policies will be designed as a win-win for all, and enable huge opportunities in the automotive sector.
6. Clean Mobility powered by Clean Energy is our most powerful weapon in our fight against Climate Change!
This means a pollution-free clean drive, leading to clean air and better living standards for our people.
We should champion the idea of ‘clean kilometres’.
This could be achieved through bio-fuels electric or solar charging.
Electric Vehicles in particular can complement our investments in renewable energy.
7. Cutting-edge: Mobility is like the Internet in its early days.
It is Cutting-edge.
It is the next big innovation sector.
The ‘Move Hack’ and ‘Pitch to Move’ events organized over the past week show how young minds are coming up with creative solutions.
Entrepreneurs should see mobility as a sector with immense opportunity for innovation and growth.
It is a sector where innovation can help solve problems for public good.
In conclusion, let me particularly appeal to the youth of India.
My young, dynamic friends, this is your opportunity to lead a new era of innovation.
This is the future.
This is the sector that will absorb everything from those with doctors to engineers to drivers to mechanics.
We should embrace this revolution early, and leverage our strengths to lead the mobility innovation ecosystem both for ourselves and for others.
The Talent and Technology assembled here today, has the capability of making a transformative mobility shift for India and the World.
This shift will be based on ‘Caring for our World’, and ‘Sharing with Others’.
I look forward to see what we can do together.

PM to address Kisan Kalyan Mela at Sehore in Madhya Pradesh; release guidelines for Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will address farmers; and highlight Government initiatives for the development of the agriculture sector and welfare of farmers, at the Kisan Kalyan Mela at Sehore in Madhya Pradesh tomorrow.
He will also release the guidelines for operationalization of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the pathbreaking scheme for crop insurance, that was approved by the Union Cabinet last month.
The scheme will come into effect from the upcoming Kharif season.
It envisages a uniform premium of only 2 per cent to be paid by farmers for Kharif crops, and 1.5 per cent for Rabi crops.
The premium for annual commercial and horticultural crops will be 5 per cent.
There is no upper limit on Government subsidy for this scheme.
The provision of capping the premium rate, which existed in earlier schemes, and resulted in low claims being paid to farmers, has been done away with.
The specific activities to be performed by DGCA of India and the DGCA of France under this MOU will be carried out by mutual consent.
Kochi, the queen of the Arabian Sea, is an important spice trading centre.
The Union Government has so far released over two thousand crore rupees for Kochi Metro.
It will cover 13.26 kilometres and eleven stations.
It is the first metro project to be commissioned with a modern signalling system called the “Communication Based Train Control Signalling system”.
The coaches reflect the “Make in India” vision.
The Kochi metro integrates the city’s entire public transportation network into a single system.
This system will have a common time-table, common ticketing and centralised `command and control’.
It also focuses on improving last mile connectivity and non-motorised transportation systems in the inner city.
In future, it will fulfil all their travel related requirements, regular payment needs and provide city and tourist information.
Thus, it is a good example of an e-Governance digital platform.
The long-term plan is to become a zero-carbon emitting urban transit system.
It is heartening to note that all stations as well as the Operation Control Centre of Kochi Metro have achieved platinum rating which is the highest certification level given by the Indian Green Building Council.
In PRAGATI meetings, I have personally reviewed nearly 175 projects worth more than eight lakh crore rupees.

This session is significant as it begins just ahead of 15th August when we remember the great freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the country.
Our 70 year old journey will scale new heights in this session.
Hence all of us should join hands together in the parliament to give a new impetus and direction to country.
I believe that all the parties and the leaders over the past few days whether individually or collectively, have shared the sentiments that we are committed to take best of the decisions for the benefit of the country and to carry the nation forward on a fast track.
My Best wishes to all of you.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister remarked that rarely has an institution left its imprint on three centuries.
He added that the Bombay Art Society has managed to do so, right from its inception in the late nineteenth century.
He said that the reason for this is that art has its own strength and message.
He said art helps in keeping the human spirit alive in individuals, even in this machine age.
The Prime Minister said art should never be dependent on the establishment, but it should definitely be patronised by the establishment.
Elaborating on the letters A, R, and T, that make up the word “art”, the Prime Minister said that they stand for the qualities of agelessness, racelessness, regionlessness, and timelessness – all of which define art.
The Prime Minister suggested that digital technology can be used to document the process of creation of a work of art, and this could help people comprehend the thought process of the artist.
Noting that the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre for Socio Economic Transformation is also part of this project, the Prime Minister said that this will be an important centre for research on social and economic issues.
He said the centre would function as a think-tank for inclusive growth, and related socio-economic matters.
The Prime Minister said that thought-leaders and visionaries have shaped the direction of our country, at different points in time.
He said the country is indebted to Baba Saheb, for his contributions to nation-building.
He said the Union Government wants more and more people, and especially the youth, to learn about his vision and ideas.
That is why, he added, that important places related to Dr. Ambedkar’s life have been developed as centres of pilgrimage.
In this context, he mentioned the sites at Alipur in Delhi; Mhow in Madhya Pradesh; Indu Mill in Mumbai; Deeksha Bhumi in Nagpur; and the house in London.
He said that this ‘Panchteerth’ is the today’s generation’s way of paying homage to Dr. Ambedkar.
He said that the BHIM App for digital transactions, is the Union Government’s homage to the economic vision of Dr. Ambedkar.
He said today’s generation has the capability and the potential to eradicate social evils.

Mahatma Gandhi had once said, “One must care about the world one will not see”.
Indeed, humanity has progressed when it has collectively risen to its obligation to the world and responsibility to the future.
Seventy years after the end of a tragic war and birth of a new hope for our age, we are meeting to chart a course for our humanity and our planet.
I consider this a very important summit and thank UN Secretary General for organizing it.
Just as our vision behind the Agenda 2030 is lofty, our goals are comprehensive.
It gives priority to the problems that have endured through the past decades.
And, it reflects our evolving understanding of the social, economic and environmental linkages that define our lives.
We live in an age of unprecedented prosperity, but also unspeakable deprivation around the world.
I am pleased that elimination of poverty in all forms everywhere is at the top of our goals.
Addressing the needs of 1.3 billion poor people in the world is not merely a question of their survival and dignity or our moral responsibility.
It is a vital necessity for ensuring peaceful, sustainable and just world.
A great Indian thinker, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, placed the welfare of the poorest at the centre of his thoughts.
This is what we also see in the 2030 Agenda.
It is a happy coincidence that we are beginning the celebration of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s 100th anniversary today.
The goals recognize that economic growth, industrialization, infrastructure, and access to energy provide the foundations of development.
We welcome the prominence given to environmental goals, especially climate change and sustainable consumption.
The distinct goal on ocean ecosystem reflects the unique character of its challenges and opportunities.
Equally important, it focuses our attention on the future of the island states.
I speak about Blue Revolution, which includes the prosperity, sustainable use of marine wealth and blue skies.
Today, much of India’s development agenda is mirrored in the Sustainable Development Goals.
Since Independence, we have pursued the dream of eliminating poverty from India.
We have chosen the path of removing poverty by empowering the poor.
We have placed priority on education and skill development.
The world speaks of private sector and public sector.
Sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be of great consequence to the world and our beautiful planet.
It will be a world of fewer challenges and greater hope; and, more confident of its success.
Our success will give us more resources to share with our friends.
As India’s ancient saying goes, the wise look at the world as one family.
Today, India is fulfilling its responsibilities as development partners in Asia and Africa and with small island states from the Pacific to the Atlantic.
Nations have a national responsibility for sustainable development.
They also need policy space.
However, we are here today in the United Nations because we all believe that international partnership must be at the centre of our efforts, whether it is development or combating climate change.
And, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the bedrock of our collective enterprise.
When we speak only of climate change, there is a perception of our desire to secure the comforts of our lifestyle.
When we speak of climate justice, we demonstrate our sensitivity and resolve to secure the future of the poor from the perils of natural disasters.
In addressing climate change, it is important to focus on solutions that can help us reach our goals.
We should forge a global public partnership to harness technology, innovation and finance to put affordable clean and renewable energy within the reach of all.
Equally, we must look for changes in our lifestyles that would make us less dependent on energy and more sustainable in our consumption.
It is equally critical to launch a global education programme that prepares our next generation to protect and conserve Nature.
I hope that the Developed World will fulfil its financing commitments for development and climate change, without in any way putting both under the same head!
I also hope that the Technology Facilitation Mechanism will turn technology and innovation into an effective instrument for global public good, not just private returns.
As we see now, distance is no insulation from challenges.
And, they can rise from the shadows of conflict and privations from distant lands.
So, we must transform international partnerships on the strength of solidarity with fellow human beings and also our enlightened self-interest.
I am confident that we can.
In the end, let me express my hope for everyone’s well with a few lines from our ancient texts:-
May all be happy, may all be healthy, may all see welfare, may no one have any sorrow.
The Memorandum of Cooperation will enable establishment and promotion of closer and long-term cooperation between the two countries in the field of environment protection and management of natural resources on the basis of equity, reciprocity and mutual benefits, taking into account the applicable laws and legal provisions in each country.

Your Excellency Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe,
I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to you, and Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe, and members of your delegation.
Let me congratulate you once again for leading the United National Front for Good Governance alliance to victory in last month’s parliamentary elections.
We are deeply honoured that you have chosen India as your first overseas destination.
It is a happy coincidence that your last full term as Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister coincided with the first NDA Government.
We thank you for your belief in and steadfast support for India-Sri Lanka relations.
This is a historic year for India-Sri Lanka relations, as it is for Sri Lanka.
We had the honour of hosting President Sirisena on his maiden visit abroad in February.
I had the privilege of an extraordinary visit to Sri Lanka in March.
Now, we have Prime Minister Wickremesinghe here.
Sri Lanka has voted twice this year for change, reforms, reconciliation and progress.
There can be no stronger statement of Sri Lanka’s democratic tradition.
There can be no clearer sign of Sri Lanka’s march towards a peaceful, inclusive, and prosperous future.
As a close neighbour and friend, we wish Sri Lanka every success; rejoice in your progress; and, assure you of India’s unwavering support.
So, we are pleased that the Government of Sri Lanka has taken a number of significant steps in recent times.
The leadership has shown remarkable political unity, at a time of great hope.
Your progress is important for our two countries, South Asia and our maritime region.
Prime Minister and I had excellent discussions today.
We welcomed some significant developments in bilateral relations since March, including the currency swap arrangement.
We also expressed hope that progress on key bilateral initiatives and projects will gather speed now.
We both want deeper economic engagement.
We would like to see our trade grow and become more balanced for Sri Lanka.
We discussed how we can achieve these goals in a more open and competitive Indian market, including through bilateral arrangements for trade and investments.
I also sought his support for Indian investors, who are keen to participate in Sri Lanka’s economic development, especially in infrastructure, energy and transport sectors.
I offered India’s full support to strengthen connectivity between our two countries to deepen human and economic links that will benefit all sections of our societies.
We will continue to nurture people-to-people ties.
We just finished an absorbing test series.
We shall all miss the great Kumar Sangakkara on the cricket field.
We both reaffirmed our commitment to deepen our defence and security cooperation.
We will intensify cooperation in combating terrorism and work together for security and stability in our maritime neighbourhood.
Prime Minister and I also discussed the fishermen issue.
We agreed that fishermen’s associations on both sides should continue their efforts to find a solution.
I conveyed to him that this should be seen as a humanitarian issue that affects livelihoods.
I informed him of the steps we are taking to encourage Indian fishermen to take up deep sea fishing.
In conclusion, let me say that India and Sri Lanka have a huge stake in each other’s success, and in stability and development in our region.
This is a relationship that touches the hearts of ordinary Indians and Sri Lankans.
It is also of great strategic importance to our two countries.
With President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, we can look to the future with great optimism.

It is a matter of great privilege that you will be the Guest of Honour at our 70th Republic Day Parade tomorrow.
Our partnership spans the un-breakable bonds of history that have linked the national movements of India and South Africa.
Now, our partnership is about a shared and prosperous future, which realizes the dreams of Madiba and Mahatma for our people.
We seek constantly to engage and collaborate for a better future for our people, and also the world.
We sealed a strategic partnership 22 years ago through the Red Fort Declaration.
Trade between India and South Africa is on the up-swing, and has crossed the 10 billion dollar mark in 2017-18.
However, there is great potential still.
I call upon all Indian and South African government agencies, investment promotion organizations as well as business leaders of both countries to work pro-actively to realize the true potential.
I was pleased to see that there has been significant participation and presence from African countries in our States.
In my earlier role as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I was happy to welcome prominent participants from South Africa.
It is gratifying that the Vibrant Gujarat last week once again welcomed our friends and partners from South Africa in large numbers.
One day was specifically marked as ‘Africa Day’.
This shows that our bonds are much deeper than we generally realize.
It also wonderful for our bilateral economic partnership.
Ladies and Gentlemen, India’s economy currently at 2.6 trillion dollars is the fastest growing major economy of the world.
And, we are on our way to becoming the fifth largest economy globally.
But, we are not satisfied.

Our special programmes such as Make in India, Digital India and Start-Up India have caught the imagination of the world.
Our industry has progressed towards Industry Four Point Zero and other innovative technologies including Artificial Intelligence, 3-D Printing, Robotics.

We wish you well in your efforts to attract Foreign Direct Investment into South-Africa, as well as for the creation of over one million jobs for the youth in three years.
I am happy that India is contributing to these objectives.
Our investment into South Africa is constantly growing.
As a brotherly nation, India will be happy to share its experience in policy reforms and setting up ground level agencies.
We encourage even more investment by Indian companies in South Africa and are confident that more South African companies will also enter the Indian market.
I assure you that New India would welcome you to look at all available opportunities, particularly in Food & Agro processing, Deep mining, Defence, Fin-tech, Insurance and Infrastructure sectors.
We are delighted to be a part of the South Africa skills story through the recent launch of the Gandhi Mandela Skills Institute.
This initiative seeks to empower the youth.
Another important collaboration between our two countries could be in the Gems and Jewelry sector.
Both countries could explore avenues for direct procurement of diamond.
It will ensure economies of scale, and also reduce the cost for both buyers and sellers.
South Africa could also join hands with India in our campaign for New and Renewable Energy, specifically through the “International Solar Alliance”.
We must work together for a new era of shared growth and prosperity for the benefit of our two countries and peoples.

Therefore, the theme of the Conference “Hydrocarbons to Fuel the Future, Choices and Challenges” is both apt and timely.
Apart from fast growth, our economy has also been more stable than most others.
Our Current Account Deficit has improved steadily and reached the decade low in the June quarter.
Hydrocarbons will continue to play an important part in India’s growth.
I take this opportunity to share with you some of my thoughts on the expectations from the hydrocarbon sector and our endeavour to achieve energy security.
Therefore, my vision for India’s energy future has four pillars:
–Energy access –Energy efficiency –Energy sustainability –Energy security
Let me start with energy access.
While some of India’s rich are buying hybrid cars, many of India’s poor are still buying firewood for cooking.
Use of firewood and other biomass for cooking is a health hazard for rural women.
In one stroke, this programme improves health, increases productivity and reduces harmful emissions.
The government bears the one time cost of the connection but the consumer pays the full price for the gas.
We are working to ensure that every village in India has access to electricity by March 2018.
Let me now turn to energy efficiency.
India’s commercial transport sector has become skewed.
An increasing proportion of goods is transported by road.
We are constructing a high speed rail corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad which will be more energy efficient than air travel.
We have given a big thrust to waterways, both inland and coastal.
Our Sagarmala project will connect the whole of India’s long coastline.
We have also opened up new inland shipping routes on large rivers.
These steps will improve energy efficiency.
The long awaited legislation on a national Goods and Services Tax has been passed.
Energy sustainability, for me, is a sacred duty.
It is something India does out of commitment, not out of compulsion.
Thanks to our efforts, capacities have increased and prices of renewable energy have crashed.
CNG, LPG, and Biofuels are cleaner fuels for the transportation sector.
We need to explore options to produce biodiesel on barren lands, which will further provide financial assistance to farmers.
R&D on second and third generation biofuels and fuel cells are required to meet the country’s energy challenges.
Let me now turn to energy security.
We need to increase our domestic oil and gas production and reduce import dependence.
I have set a target to reduce import dependence by ten per cent by 2022.
This will have to be achieved during a period of increasing oil consumption.
However, several factors adversely affected India’s domestic oil and gas output.
Last year, we announced the new Marginal Fields Policy.
The estimated recoverable reserves are of the order of thirty Million Metric Tonnes.
I understand that an encouraging response has been received to the bidding process with several global companies participating.
The downstream sector is now more open, creating a level playing field for all market players.
Recent acquisitions of hydrocarbon assets in Russia by investing 5.6 billion dollars for fifteen million tonnes of equity oil equivalent, are one such instance.
Indian energy companies must become multinational; and work towards India-Middle East, India-Central Asia, and India-South Asia energy corridors.
Natural Gas is the next generation fossil fuel – cheaper, and less polluting.
We have given priority to move towards a gas based economy.
I am confident that with initiatives like “Make in India”, “Startup India”, and “Standup India”, there will be opportunities for youth to venture into Indian Oil and Gas sector and to bring innovative ideas.
Technology development in refining, nanotechnology, catalyst development, biofuel and alternate energy are areas we need to focus upon.
The successful development of IndMax technology by IndianOil is an example of innovative thinking which is now on the commercial application stage.
Let me assure you that our commitment is strong and our motto is to replace Red Tape with Red Carpet.
I am sure, this august gathering will come up with innovative ideas, in which hydrocarbons will continue to fuel the future in a more efficient and sustainable way.
He said countries that achieved independence after India, and faced greater resource constraints than India, have touched new heights of development.

Today, ASEAN and India enjoy multi-faceted cooperation across ASEAN’s political-security, economic and socio-cultural pillars.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Act East’ policy and 3-C (Commerce, Connectivity, Culture) formula for strengthening engagement with ASEAN speaks to our broad-based cooperation.
We have around 30 platforms for cooperation, including an annual Leaders’ Summit and seven Ministerial Dialogues.
India has participated actively in ASEAN-led platforms including the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus, and the East Asia Summit.
On the socio-cultural front, programs like the ASEAN-India Students Exchange Programs and the annual Delhi Dialogue foster closer people-to-people relations.
Through these platforms, our youth, academics and businessmen get to meet, learn and deepen ties.
To mark this Silver Jubilee of ASEAN-India relations, both sides have held many commemorative activities.
The recent Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Singapore recognized the contributions of the Indian diaspora.
Today’s ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit marks the culmina­tion of these celebrations.
It is an honour for all the ASEAN leaders to be in New Delhi for this occasion.
ASEAN leaders are also deeply honoured to be invited as chief guests at tomorrow’s 69th Republic Day Parade.
The Singapore PM writes that Major global trends are reshaping the strategic outlook, presenting both challenges and opportunities.
The strategic balance is shifting.
Demographic, cultural and political changes are underway in many parts of the world.
We need to push on with economic integration.
We must also be resolute in dealing with emerging transboundary challenges, including terrorism, cybercrime and climate change.
India is located strategically along major sea-lanes from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.
These sea lanes are also vital trade routes for many ASEAN member states.
Both sides share an interest in preserving these vital maritime conduits of trade.
The visiting premier has suggested three promising areas of mutually beneficial collaboration.
First, ASEAN and India should redouble efforts to promote trade and investment.
We need to keep existing pathways up to date and relevant, including the AIFTA.
We should work together to conclude a high quality Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), surpassing the existing AIFTA.
This would create an integrated Asian market comprising nearly half the world’s population and a third of the world’s GDP.
Mr. Mr. Lee Hsien Loong says that India and ASEAN continue to look for new synergies.
India is rapidly urbanizing and has set itself a goal of establishing 100 smart cities.
Singapore, an urbanized city-state, is ready to partner India on this journey and help develop urban solutions based on our own experience.
Andhra Pradesh’s new capital city of Amaravati is one example.
The Singapore PM sums up his op-ed saying that as ASEAN chair, Singapore is committed to deepening ASEAN-India ties.
If both sides use our historical and cultural links to tackle today’s challenges and build bridges for the future, our youth and next generation stand to gain the most.
The Prime Minister said that defence and security are two important pillars of the India-France Strategic Partnership, and appreciated the growing bilateral engagement in all sectors.
The Prime Minister also said that he looks forward to receiving President Macron in India at his earliest convenience.
Chief Ministers and Lt. Governors of States and Union Territories, and my Cabinet colleagues,
I welcome you all to this important meeting of the Inter State Council.
There are only a few occasions when the leadership of the Centre and the States, assembles together.
This forum of cooperative federalism is the perfect setting to deliberate on the interests of the people, address their problems, and take collective and concrete decisions.
It highlights the vision of the makers of our Constitution.
Let me begin by recalling what our beloved former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said at this very forum sixteen years ago:
“In a democracy as big and diverse as ours, debate, deliberation and discussion help evolve policy that relates to the ground reality.
More importantly, they enable the effective implementation of such policies.
The Inter-State Council is an inter-governmental forum that can be used for evolving policy as well as ensuring its implementation.
I, therefore, urge the States to increasingly use this forum as an effective instrument to strengthen our democracy, our society and our polity.”
The Inter-State Council is certainly the most significant platform for strengthening Centre-State and Inter-State relations.
There has been a long hiatus since the last meeting in 2006, but I am happy that through the efforts of Home Minister Rajnath Singh ji, the process has been restarted.
Over the last one year, he has convened meetings of five zonal councils.
The increased dialogue and connect has culminated in this gathering today.
The nation can progress only if the Union and State Governments walk shoulder to shoulder.
It would be difficult for any Government to successfully implement a scheme on its own.
Therefore, provision of adequate financial resources is as important as the responsibility for implementation.
With the acceptance of the 14th Finance Commission recommendations, the States’ share in central taxes has increased from 32 per cent to 42 per cent.
This means that States now have greater financial resources to utilize in accordance with their requirements.
I am happy to share that the total amount received by States from the Centre during 2015-16 is 21 per cent higher than the amount received in 2014-15.
Auctions of other mines will yield an additional 18,000 crore rupees to states.
Similarly, through amendments to CAMPA Act, we are attempting to free up about 40,000 crore rupees lying idle in banks, for disbursal to States.
The Union Government also wishes to share with States, the amount that is being saved as a result of transparency being introduced into the system.
Kerosene is one example.
The supply of LPG will further increase.
All these efforts have a direct bearing on the consumption of kerosene.
Recently, the Chandigarh administration declared the city a kerosene-free zone.
Now, the Union Government has launched a scheme, under which, if there is a reduction in the consumption of kerosene by a State, the Centre will disburse 75 per cent of the resultant savings in subsidy, as grant to that State.
The Government of Karnataka, while moving swiftly on this initiative, has sent its proposal to the Petroleum Ministry.
This has been accepted and the grant has been disbursed to the State Government.
If all States decide to reduce kerosene consumption by 25 per cent, and actually do so, they can receive about 1600 crore rupees as grant this year.
Apart from Centre-State relations, the Inter State Council is an appropriate forum to discuss matters which are of concern to large segments of our population.
How can we evolve consensus at the policy formulation stage?
How can we address issues of mutual interest?
Therefore, in this meeting of the Inter State Council, besides the Punchhi Commission Report, three very important subjects have also been added to the Agenda.
One of these is Aadhaar.
Parliament has passed the Aadhaar Act-2016.
The passage of this Act enables us to use Aadhaar for Direct Cash Transfers for subsidy and other services.
Among adults, 96 per cent people have Aadhaar cards.
With your support, we shall connect every citizen of the country with an Aadhaar card by the year-end.
Today the simple Aadhaar card has become a symbol of empowerment.
Benefits now flow only to people genuinely entitled to receive them, with money getting directly credited to their bank accounts.
Friends, Babasaheb Ambedkar had written – “The path of social reform like the path to heaven at any rate in India, is strewn with many difficulties.
Social reform in India has few friends and many critics.”
The words written by him continue to be relevant even today.
Therefore, eschewing criticism, we must lay emphasis on promoting social reform schemes through mutual cooperation.
Many of these schemes have been designed by sub-groups of Chief Ministers under the aegis of the NITI Aayog.
Another important area of discussion in the Inter State Council is Education.
India’s greatest asset is its youth.
More than 30 crore children are currently of school-going age.
Hence, our country has the potential to provide the world with skilled manpower for many years to come.
The Centre and the States must work together to provide our children an enabling environment in which they can develop their skills and prepare themselves for today’s needs.
While planting trees, we do not charge them any fee.”
We are aware that these trees will give us oxygen in the future, and benefit the environment.
Likewise, education is also an investment that benefits the society.
Since then we have come a long way in terms of education.
But a lot still remains to be done with regard to the standard of education.
We must discuss the extent to which our system of education is genuinely educating our children.
The best way of improving the standard of education among children is to make them aware of the purpose of education.
Merely going to school is not education.
Education should generate curiosity among children.
It should teach them how to attain and enhance knowledge.
It should motivate them to continuously keep learning throughout their lives.
Swami Vivekananda also used to say that education does not mean merely attaining bookish knowledge.
The aim of education is character building.
Education means strengthening the mind, and enhancing one’s intellect, so that one can become self-reliant.
Given the kind of efficiency and ability that is required in the economy of the 21st century, it is our responsibility to ensure that our youth are equipped with at least some skill-sets.
We have to prepare our youth to think logically, think out of the box, and work creatively.
Internal Security is another important issue on the agenda today.
We have to discuss internal security challenges confronting the country, the solutions to these challenges, and mutual cooperation in this regard.
The internal security of the country cannot be strengthened until we focus on intelligence sharing, ensure greater coordination among agencies, and equip our police with modern approach and technology.
While, we have come a long way, we need to continuously increase our efficiency and capacity.
We must constantly remain alert and updated.
The meeting of the Inter State Council provides an opportunity for exchange of views in an extremely free and frank manner.
I am sure you will share your thoughts and suggestions on all the agenda items.
These will be of tremendous value.
The more we are able to forge consensus on these vital issues, the better we shall be able to tackle them.
In doing so, we shall not only strengthen the spirit of cooperative federalism and Centre-State relations, but also secure a better future for our citizens.
The two leaders agreed to work closely together to further strengthen the close, friendly and good neighbourly relations between the two countries.
In doing so, the portal is expected to help catalyse greater collaboration towards the service of the weaker sections of society, especially by leveraging the benefits of technology.
It is also expected to generate wider participation of interested people who are motivated to work for the benefit of society.
The Prime Minister will meet with key industry leaders.
He will interact with the gathering in a townhall style format.

He added that the colonial rulers were scared of those who wrote and expressed themselves through the papers.
Praising Late Shri Ramnath Goenka, the Prime Minister said that there were few in the media who challenged the Emergency and this was led by Ramnath ji.
The Prime Minister said technology poses a challenge to the media, and news that could earlier be disseminated in 24 hours now happens in 24 seconds.
He recalled and praised Queen Ahiyabai Holkar for her work on the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, over two centuries ago.
He said that since then, not much thought had been given by those in power, to the entire area around the Temple.
He said about 40 Temples near the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, had been encroached over time, and have now been freed of that encroachment.
He said the entire Temple complex is now in the process of rejuvenation, and the results are becoming visible.
He said a direct link is being established between the River Ganga, and Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
He said this project will become a model for similar projects elsewhere, and would give a new global identity to Kashi.

Spoke to Home Minister Rajnath Singh Ji on the situation in Sukma.
Your Excellency, the State Counsellor
I came here in 2014 on the occasion of ASEAN summit, however, this is my first bilateral visit to the golden land of Myanmar.
But I’m feeling at home due to the warm welcome accorded to me.
I’m grateful to the government of Myanmar for this.
Your courageous leadership of Myanmar peace process is praiseworthy.
We thoroughly understand the challenges that you have been facing.
We are partners in your concerns over the loss of lives of security forces and innocent people due to the extremist violence in Rakhine State.
Be it a large peace process or be it to resolve a specific problem, we hope that all the stakeholders can work together in the direction to find such a solution that will ensure peace, justice and dignity for all by respecting the unity and territorial integrity of Myanmar.
I believe that India’s democratic experience is also relevant for Myanmar.
And therefore we are pride of our comprehensive cooperation in the capacity building of the institutions like the executive, the legislature, election commission and press council.
Our interests in the area of security are common as neighbors.
It’s essential that we work together to ensure the stability of our long territorial and coastal borders.
The construction of roads and bridges, links in the field of energy and our efforts to boost connectivity indicate in the direction of a good future.
We have completed the work on the Sittwe port and Paletwa Inland Waterways Terminal in Kaladan project.
And the work on road component has started.
In order to meet the requirement of Upper Myanmar, two way movement of high speed diesel trucks have started from India.
Development of high quality health, education and research facilities in Myanamar under our development partnership is a cause of happiness.
In this context, Myanmar Institute of Information Technology and Advanced Centre for Agricultural Research and Education are worthy of special mention.
Both of these are emerging as the main centers of education.
In the future, our projects will only be according to the needs and priorities of Myanmar.
The agreements signed by us today between our two countries will further strengthen our multifaceted bilateral cooperation.
I am happy to announce that we have decided to give gratis visa to all citizens of Myanmar who are interested in coming to India.
I am also happy to state that we have decided to release 40 citizens of Myanmar who are currently lodged in the jails of India.
We hope that they will soon be able to meet with their families in Myanmar.
My time in Nay Pyi Taw was very meaningful.
I am also very excited about my remaining stay in Myanmar.
Today I will go to the Anand Temple in the Bagan.
The renovation work of Ananda Temple and other historic and cultural buildings is being carried out with the help of India to repair the damages caused to them due last year’s earthquake.
Apart from meeting the community of Indian origin people in Yangon, I will also pay my tributes at the monuments of religious and historical importance.
I believe that in the coming time, we will work together to build a strong and close partnership for our mutual benefit.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the President, Shri Pranab Mukherjee on his birthday and has wished for his long and healthy life.
“ Birthday wishes to Rashtrapati Ji.

Today, 75 years later the issues are different.
This will ensure that the children of those serving in lower categories in PSUs and other institutions can get the benefit of OBC reservations, on par with children of people serving in lower categories in Government.
These measures are a part of the Government’s efforts to ensure greater social justice and inclusion for members of the Other Backward Classes.
The Government has already introduced in Parliament, a bill to provide Constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes.
In its judgment dated 16.11.1992 in WP(C) 930/1990 (IndraSawhney case) the Supreme Court had directed the Government to specify the basis, for exclusion of socially and economically advanced persons from Other Backward Classes by applying the relevant and requisite socio-economic criteria.
The OM further stipulates that the said parameters would apply mutatis mutandis to officers holding equivalent or comparable posts in PSUs, Banks, Insurance Organizations, Universities, etc. and Government was required to determine equivalence of positions in these organizations with those in Government.
The determination of equivalence of posts has been thus pending for almost 24 years.
The matter of formulating equivalence has since been examined in detail.
In PSUs, all Executive level posts i.e. Board level executives and managerial level posts would be treated as equivalent to group ‘A’ posts in Government and will be considered Creamy Layer.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Independence Day.
Today, the country is brimming with self-confidence.
The country is scaling new heights by working extremely hard, with a resolve to realize its dreams.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating this festival of independence at a time when our daughters from the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, have come back after circumnavigating the seven seas.
They have returned after unfurling the Tricolour in the seven seas, colouring their waters with the hues of our Tricolor.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating this festival of independence at a time when the Mount Everest has been conquered many times; several brave-hearts and many of our daughters have unfurled the Tricolour atop the Mount Everest.
However, during this festival of independence, I will remember our young tribal children from remote forest areas, who have unfurled the Tricolour on the Mount Everest, further enhancing its glory.
Displaying utmost sensitivity and alertness, our Parliament has made the social justice framework stronger to protect the interests of the weaker sections of society – be it a Dalit, a deprived or exploited person or women.
Today, we are celebrating the festival of independence at a time when news reports have brought in a new consciousness in the country.
Today, every Indian, living in any nook and corner of the world, takes pride in the fact that India has become the sixth largest economy of the world.
Under the leadership of respected Bapu, lakhs of people sacrificed their lives and spent their youth in prisons to win freedom for our country.
Many great revolutionaries embraced the gallows bravely.
Today on behalf of my countrymen, I pay homage to those brave freedom fighters and salute them from the bottom of my heart.
Our soldiers and Paramilitary forces lay down their lives to uphold the dignity of the tricolour that inspires us to hold our heads high through life and death.
Our Police forces serve the country day and night to provide safety and security to the people.
I want to reassure the people who have lost their loved ones and are in distress, that the country is with them in their hour of crisis to help them overcome this difficult situation.
I share the grief of those who have lost their near and dear ones in this natural calamity.
Our masses had sacrificed their lives for the country’s freedom at a time when atrocities had crossed all limits.
The Jallianwallah Bagh incident reminds us of the sacrifices made by the brave hearts and is an inspiration to us.
While striving for the country’s freedom, they suffered imprisonment and spent the prime of their youth in jails, yet they nurtured the dreams of a glorious India even through all the suffering.
What was the dream that he envisioned after Independence?
Subramania Bharti said that India will show the way for the entire world to break free from every form of bondage.
This inclusive Constitution is the harbinger of a resolve to build a New India.
It has brought with it some responsibilities for us and has also set a few boundaries on us.
Our Constitution has been guiding us in realizing our dreams by stating that every section of the society and every geographical part of India must get an equal opportunity in the quest to forge ahead.
It indicates that we should ensure justice for the poor, equal opportunity for all to move ahead, our lower middle class, middle class and higher middle class should not face any obstacle in their growth, the Government should not come in the way, social systems should not curb their dreams.
We should create an enabling environment that provides them maximum opportunities to grow and blossom, and they should be allowed to flourish without limitation.
Be it our elderly, differently-abled, our women, marginalized or deprived people, or our Adivasi brethren living in the forests, everyone must get an opportunity to grow, as per their hopes and aspirations.
We aspire for an India that is strong and self-reliant, a nation that maintains a steady pace of progress, an India that keeps scaling new heights; an India that enjoys goodwill in the world.
Not only this, we want that India should also shine in the world – we want to build such an India.
When 125 crore countrymen become partners, then each and every citizen joins us in the progress of the country.
When 125 crore dreams, 125 crore resolves, 125 crore efforts, move in the right direction to attain desired goals then nothing is unattainable.
The citizens did not stop at government formation, but worked to build the nation.
They have come together, were together and will continue to be together.
I feel that this synergy of 125 crore active citizens from more than 6 lakhs villages is the real strength of our nation.
Today, we celebrate the birth anniversary of Shri Aurobindo.
He said something very pertinent – What is Nation?
What is our Motherland?
It is not a mere piece of land, not just an identity, nor is it a figment of imagination.
The Nation is a repository of a great force manifested through many organized units to give it a concrete shape.
It is this thought of Sri Aurobindo which is uniting the country and taking it ahead.
That we are actually moving ahead is difficult to comprehend unless we know from where we started.
If we don’t look at from where we began our journey, it will not be possible to assess how far we have come.
Precisely for this reason, if we consider 2013 as the base year and take into consideration the work that has been done in the last four years, you will be surprised to see the speed at which the country is moving and the pace at which the progress is being made.
Take the case of toilets.
If we had continued with the same speed of constructing toilets as in 2013, then to achieve 100% target would have taken decades.
If we talk about providing electricity to villages on the basis of work done in 2013, it would have taken a couple of more decades to accomplish this work.
If we talk about providing smoke free LPG gas connection to the poor and to the poor mothers, at the rate in which it was done in 2013, it could not have been completed even in a 100 years.
If we had maintained the speed of 2013 in laying optical fibre network in villages, then we would not have been able to accomplish the task for generations together.
We will strive to maintain the same pace of development.
Today, we can see a sea change in the country although the country is same, the soil is same, the wind is same, the sky is same, the sea is same, the government offices are same, the files are same and the decision making process remains the same.
However, the country has been experiencing change for the last four years.
A new spirit, new energy, new resolve, new determination and new inspiration is taking the country forward.
This is why the country has doubled the pace of construction of the highways.
The construction of new houses has gone up four times in the villages.
Giving momentum to Skill Development Missions, the country is setting up new centers in small towns.
At the same time, our tier-2 and tier-3 cities are being flooded with start-up enterprises, bringing regeneration.
Brothers and Sisters, Digital India is now making inroads into our villages.
As a government sensitive to the needs of people, efforts are being made to turn Digital India into a reality.
At the same time, work is also progressing with the same dedication to compile dictionary and common signs for my differently-abled brothers and sisters.
While on the one hand, our farmers are working on modern agricultural techniques like micro irrigation, drip irrigation and sprinklers, on the other hand, 99 big closed irrigation projects have also been revived.
Our soldiers reach out to provide relief and rescue operations during natural calamities.
While our soldiers display exemplary courage in reaching out to rescue the people in difficulties, they have also shown a steely resolve to carry out surgical strikes and vanquish our enemies.
Take a glance at the vast canvass of the development in our country- from one end to the other, one can witness the progress of the country that is moving ahead with new energy and enthusiasm.
I hail from Gujarat.
There is a saying in Gujarati ‘Nishan Chuk Maaf Lekin Nahi Maaf Nichu Nishan’ which means one should have big aims and dreams.
However, for that, one has to strive hard and be answerable.
But if the aims are not big, targets are not far-sighted, decisions are also not taken.
Development comes to a halt.
That is why my dear brothers and sisters, it is necessary for us to move ahead with big aims and resolve.
When targets are vague, when the spirit is not strong, then important decisions in our social life also get held up for years.
Take for instance the case of MSP – economists, farmer organizations, farmers as well as political parties had been demanding, that farmers should get an MSP which is one and a half times of their investment.
The matter was debated for years, files moved to and fro, and but was stuck.
Finally, we took the decision.
We took a bold decision of giving the farmers the MSP which is one and half times their investment.
Today, with the help of small traders, their open mindedness and their attitude of accepting the new, the country has implemented GST.
A new found confidence has been generated in the business community.
Today, we have enacted laws on Insolvency and Bankruptcy to strengthen the banking sector.
Who opposed them earlier?
Taking decisions requires conviction, force, confidence and complete dedication to the good of the common man.
Why was the Benami property law not enforced earlier?
The Benami property laws are implemented only when there is courage and a determination to do something for the country.
The Jawans of our defence forces were demanding one-rank one-pension for several decades.
They were not resorting to agitation because they are disciplined, but nobody was paying heed to their voices.
Somebody needed to take a decision in this regard.
You gave us the responsibility of taking this decision and we fulfilled it positively.
We are capable of taking tough decisions because national interest is topmost in our priority.
You may recall the comments made about India prior to 2014, by eminent international institutions, top economists of the world, and by those considered authorities on the subject.
There was a time when the Indian economy was considered risky by experts.
But now the same experts and the institutions have expressed confidence that our reform momentum has strengthened our economic fundamentals.
How have things changed?
There was a time when the world used to comment about red tape in India but now they talk about Red Carpet.
We have reached the 100th spot in Ease of Doing Business ranking.
Today, the entire world is looking at this achievement with pride.
There was a time when the world perceived India as a country with ‘policy paralysis’ and ‘delayed reforms’.
Old newspaper clippings confirm this view.
However, today the world opinion about India has changed and they talk about our focus on reform, perform and transform.
This follows from a series of time bound policy decisions.
There was a time when the world counted India among the ‘fragile five’.
The same set of experts who had earlier dubbed India as a ‘sleeping elephant’ are now saying that ‘sleeping elephant’ has woken up and started running.
Economists and international institutions are saying that India will provide momentum to the world economy for the next three decades and will spur the growth of the world.
Today, India’s stature at International fora has risen greatly.
India’s voice is being heard in every organization of which she is a member.
India is playing a crucial role in shaping up the discourse and providing leadership to these organizations.
We are raising our voice at international fora.
Today India has become the flag bearer of International Solar Alliance in the world.
Today, every country of the world is keen to welcome any Indian stepping on its soil.
A new consciousness is visible in their eyes, when they look at an Indian.
The strength of the Indian passport has multiplied manifold.
This has instilled a new self-confidence, fresh energy and a resolve in every Indian to move ahead with new hope.
My dear countrymen, if an Indian is in trouble or distress in any part of the world, he can rest assured that his country is with him at every step.
Several recent incidents bear testimony to this fact.
My dear countrymen, just as the perspective of the world towards India has transformed, similarly, there was a time when the news from India’s North-Eastern part used to be dominated with content that one wished were not there.
However, today my dear brothers and sisters, North-East is coming up with positive and inspiring stories.
North-East today is shining in the field of sports.
My dear brothers and sisters, today we are receiving news from North-East that the last village has been electrified and the entire village danced the whole night.
We are hearing more such news from the North East about highways, railways, airways, waterways and information ways (i-ways) coming to the region.
The work of installing electric transmission lines across the North-East is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today youth from the North-East are establishing BPOs in the region.
North-East is going to host the Sports University.
Brothers and sisters, there was a time when the North-East used to feel that Delhi is very distant.
Within four years, we have brought Delhi to the doorsteps of North-East.
Brothers and sisters, today, about 65% of the population in the country is below 35 years of age.
We are proud of our country’s youth.
Our country’s youngsters have completely transformed the meaning of all standards of the economy.
They have infused new colours to the country’s standard of progress.
There was a time when only big cities used to hog all the limelight.
Today, our country is talking about Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and paying attention to the youngsters engaged in modern agriculture in the rural areas.
The youth of our country has completely transformed the nature of jobs.
Today the youngsters of the country are taking the nation to greater heights by exploring and engaging in new fields such as Start-ups, BPOs, E-commerce, mobility etc.
My dear countrymen, 13 crore Mudra Loans has been a major achievement.
More so, if it includes 4 crore youth who have taken the loan for the first time with the aspiration to become self-reliant and are promoting self-employment.
In an endeavor to realize the dream of Digital India, several Common Service Centres are being managed by young girls and boys in more than 3 lakhs villages today.
These centres are rendering “on-the-click global connect”/”anytime-anywhere connectivity” services to every citizen in the villages with the optimal utilization of Information Technology.
Talking about infrastructure, whether it be speed of rails, roads, I-ways, highways or a new airport, our nation is witnessing fast paced development.
Brothers and Sisters, scientists of our nation have also left no stone unturned in bringing immense glory to our country.
That’s the capability of Indian scientists which has made the world stand up and applaud.
Successful launch of Mangalyaan in the very first attempt itself stands as testimony to the expertise and endeavors of our scientists.
This feat of successful in orbit launch of Mangalyaan speaks volumes about the capabilities of our scientists.
In days to come, thanks to the futuristic vision, innovativeness and creativity of our scientists we are confident of launching NavIC, the first indigenous Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).
This navigation system will guide fishermen and other citizens through Satellite signals.
My dear countrymen, today from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I am delighted to share a good news.
Our country is undoubtedly progressing fast in its space missions.
However, we have a dream; our scientists have a dream.
We have resolved that by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years of Independence or maybe even before that, certainly some of our young boys and girls will unfurl the Tricolour in space.
With Mangalyaan our scientists have proved their capabilities.
I feel proud to announce that very soon as a part of our Manned-Space mission, we shall be sending an Indian into space.
Dear brothers and sisters, I would like to congratulate our scientists and technicians for such a great accomplishment.
I sincerely acknowledge the role of our agricultural scientists, cultivators and farmers in successfully steering the green revolution across decades.
But my brothers and sisters, times have changed now.
Our farmers and the agricultural markets have to face global challenges and competition.
As the population increases, land falls short.
Precisely for this reason we are focusing on change and bringing in modern methods in the agricultural sector.
We have a vision to double the farmers’ income by the 75th year of Independence.
To keep our promises, we have to work hard, we have to plan and we have to put our heart and soul into fulfilling it.
So in order to realize this promise by 75th year of Independence, we want to move along with the farmers in that direction by bringing modernity and diversity in agricultural sector.
We want to bring value addition right from seeds to marketing.
We want to modernize.
Some new crops are giving record yields.
For the first time we are moving towards agriculture export policy so that our farmers can also face global competition with confidence.
Today we can see a new agricultural revolution.
Organic farming, Blue revolution, sweet revolution and solar farming have opened up new vistas.
It is a matter of great satisfaction that today our country is the second highest fish producer in the world and is on the verge of reaching the top position soon.
It means, in rural economy other businesses allied to agriculture are also as important as agriculture.
We are developing village resources by spending crores of rupees through women self help groups.
Khadi is associated with the name of respected Bapu.
My brothers and sisters, the farmers of my country are emphasizing on solar farming now.
The people who spin charkha, the people who are associated with handloom are also earning their livelihood.
So to protect human dignity, we have to move ahead with those schemes which will ensure respectable lives for people.
The policies, traditions and intentions should be such that ordinary people, including the poorest of the poor can get a chance to live with equal dignity.
So we have provided gas connection to the poor through Ujjawala Yojana.
We have provided electricity to the poor through Saubhagya Yojana.
We are emphasizing on moving ahead with the concept of ‘Shrameva Jayate’.
Only yesterday, we heard the President’s address to the nation.
He described in great detail the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan.
Whenever, there is talk about Government, it is said that policies are framed but there is no last mile delivery.
My dear countrymen, when I talked about cleanliness from the Ramparts of Red Fort in 2014, some people made fun.
Some of them even said the Government had many things to do, why is it wasting its energy on an issue like cleanliness.
But my dear brothers and sisters, in a recent report the WHO has said that because of the cleanliness campaign three lakh children were saved.
The credit for saving lives of three lakh children goes to every Indian who was a part of this campaign.
Brothers and Sisters, Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th Birth Anniversary falls next year.
Bapu during his lifetime attached greater importance to cleanliness than even to freedom.
He used to say we got our freedom because of Satyagrahisand Swachchata (cleanliness) will come from Swachchagrahis.
In the coming days, when we will be celebrating his 150th Birth Anniversary, crores of Swachchagrahis will offer Karyanjali (offerings of work) in the memory of Bapu.
In a way, they will fulfil his dreams which we are realizing now.
My Brothers and Sisters, it is true that because of cleanliness, lives of three lakh children have been saved.
But no matter how happy a middle class family is and how well-to-do it is or how poor it is, once a family member falls sick, the whole family suffers.
On occasions generations are afflicted with illnesses.
The Government of India has decided to launch Pradhanmantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan so that the poor man, the common man gets free treatment for serious diseases and he can be admitted to big hospitals free of cost.
The Pradhanmantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan and Ayushman Bharat Yojana will cover 10 crore families of the country.
In the coming days, the people from lower middle class, middle class and upper middle class income groups can also access health care services from these two programs.
There is a provision of giving five lakh rupees per annum health assurance for each family.
As such, an ordinary citizen will not face any difficulty as technology technological tools have been built for this purpose.
Over the next four, five, six weeks from today, this technology will be tested across the country to make it fool proof.
On the 25th of September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, the Pradhanmantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan will be launched throughout the country.
No poor person of the country will have to face difficulty in dealing with diseases.
Nor he would have to borrow money from a moneylender paying interest.
His family will not be destroyed.
And it will also open new avenues of employment for the youth, for the middle class families in the health sector.
New hospitals will be built in the tier-2 and tier-3 cities.
They will require medical staff in large numbers.
A lot of employment opportunities will also be generated.
Brothers and sisters, no poor person wants to lead a life of penury.
No poor person wants to die poor.
No poor person wants to pass on his poverty as a legacy to his children.
Throughout his life, he struggles to come out of poverty.
There is only one way to end this problem- through the empowerment of poor people.
In the last four years, we have laid emphasis on empowerment of poor people.
It has been our endeavour to empower the poor people.
An international organization has released a very good report in the recent past.
According to the report, five crore poor people in India have crossed the Poverty Line in the last two years.
If I combine the population of America (USA), Canada and Mexico, then the number of beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Program will be nearly the same.
If I take into account the population of entire Europe, then nearly the same number of people are going to get the benefits of this Ayushman Bharat scheme in India.
Brothers and sisters, we have formulated several schemes for empowerment of the poor.
Although many schemes have been formulated in the past, middlemen, the people who take cuts, used to take away the cream of the scheme.
The poor people didn’t get what rightfully belonged to them.
Money was being paid from the exchequer, the schemes existed on paper, and the country continued to be robbed.
The Government cannot keep its eyes shut.
And, at least I can never keep my eyes shut to this kind of thing.
And whether it is the state governments or the centre or whether these are the local bodies of self-rule, we all have to work together.
And we will have to take it forward.
How difficult it would have been to remove these six crore names!
How many people would have faced problems because of this !
The person who was never born, the person who doesn’t exist anywhere on the earth, but the money was pilfered on his name by using bogus names.
This government has put an end to it.
We have taken steps in the direction of curbing corruption and putting an end to the entire system of black money.
Brothers and sisters, what are the consequences of it?
Rs.90,000 crores is not a small amount.
Similarly, rice which is sold at Rs.30-32 in the market is purchased by the Government at this rate and provided to the poor at Rs.3 on ration cards.
This means if anyone steals 1 kg of wheat on a bogus ration card, he automatically gains Rs.20-25.
If gets rice in this manner, he will get Rs 30-35.
That’s why this entire business of bogus names and IDs had been going on.
When a poor person used to approach the shop with his ration card and request grain, the shopkeeper would say that the stock was over.
That grain then used to be diverted to another shop and the poor had to purchase the grain of Rs.2 from the other shop at Rs.20-25.
The right of the poor used to be snatched away.
Therefore, this bogus system has now been uprooted.
Brothers and sisters, crores of poor people in our country get food at Rs.2 and Rs.3.
The government is spending generously for the same but the credit does not go to the government.
Today I want to specifically tell the honest taxpayers that when you have your food with your family, for a moment kindly ponder over what I am about to say.
I want to touch the hearts of the honest taxpayers.
I want to salute them.
I want to reassure the honest taxpayers that all the schemes that are in operation are run by your money.
The honest tax payers gain good fortune because the poor get to eat from the taxpayers’ money.
However, when a person, even if he is in an AC room, comes to know that 3 poor families are being served with his tax money, it is highly satisfying for his soul.
This is the most virtuous task for a person.
Brothers and sisters, today, the country is moving ahead celebrating the festival of honesty.
Till 2013, i.e. for the last 70 years, there were 4 crore people who were paying direct taxes.
In the past 70 years, 70 lakh enterprises were included in the Indirect tax net.
However, in the last one year alone, after the introduction of GST, the figure has catapulted to one crore and 16 lakh.
Brothers and sisters, today everyone in the country is participating in celebrating the festival of honesty.
I salute all those who are embracing transparency and honesty.
Therefore, we will not tolerate black money and corruption.
Come what may, we shall not retract from the path of honesty, as we all have seen how they have corroded and ruined the nation.
Thus, you would have seen that power-brokers are not to be seen in the power corridors of Delhi.
Dear countrymen, times have changed.
Some people sitting in their drawing rooms used to claim that they will change the policies of the government, or influence in them in a negative way have been silenced.
We have strongly condemned favoritism and bias.
Strong action is being taken against corrupt officers.
More than three lakh dubious companies have been closed down, and restrictions have been imposed on their directors.
Today, we have introduced IT interventions for online transactions to ensure transparency.
There was a time when seeking an environmental clearance meant facing rampant corruption.
This is the first time after independence that the Union Cabinet has the maximum representation of women ministers.
Dear Countrymen, today I wish to share some wonderful news with my brave daughters.
On this occasion, I declare with pride the grant of Permanent Commission for the appointment of women officers in Short Service Commission of Indian Armed Forces.
The process will be transparent and similar to the selection process of male officers.
This is a gift from my side from the ramparts of the Red Fort, to the daughters who are in uniformed services and have dedicated their lives to the nation.
The nation salutes the patriotic fervor and national commitment displayed by young girls who are our national pride.
Women are equally contributing in building a strong India.
The nation is experiencing the pride, contribution and potential of our mothers and sisters.
From agricultural fields to the sports arena, our women are holding the Indian Tricolor high.
From Sarpanch to the Parliament, our women are contributing to the development of the country.
From schools to armed forces everywhere the women of our country are marching ahead.
But while our women are valiantly moving ahead in such large numbers, we also come across gruesome ugliness.
Brothers and sisters, we have to free this society from this demonic mentality.
The law is taking its own course.
Recently, rapists in a case from Katni in Madhya Pradesh were sentenced to death after just five days of trial.
Similarly, in Rajasthan, rapists were sentenced to death after a few days of trial.
More such news gets published, the more such people with demonic mentality will get scared.
We have to publicize such news.
People should know that rapists are being sent to the gallows.
Brothers and sisters, this mentality breeds unpardonable crimes.
Nobody can be allowed to take law into their own hands.
In the family, in schools, colleges, our children of the new generation, our small innocent children should be nurtured in such an environment that they learn appropriate values.
They should learn to respect women.
They should know that this is the right way to live.
We have to instill this feeling and values in our families.
Brothers and sisters, I want to reassure my Muslim sisters.
Triple Talaq has spoiled the lives of Muslim daughters of our country.
Those who have not faced the Talaq are spending their lives under pressure.
We wanted to bring a legislation in this session of Parliament itself to free Muslim women from this evil system.
But there are some people who are obstructing the passage of this Bill.
But I want to assure my Muslim mothers, sisters and daughters that I will not stop till they get justice.
I will fulfill your aspirations.
My beloved countrymen, our army, paramilitary forces, police, intelligence agencies are the source of strength for our country’s internal security.
They have created a sense of security in us.
They have ensured a peaceful environment.
A new confidence has been generated because of their sacrifices, dedication and hard work.
But today the two states of Meghalaya and Tripura have seen withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA) which was in force for three or four decades.
This was possible because of efforts of our security forces, because of actions taken by the state Governments, because of development projects executed by the Centre and the state Governments and the efforts to connect people there with the national mainstream.
Tripura and Meghalaya are now out of the purview of the Armed Forces Special Power Act.
Several districts of Arunachal Pradesh have also been brought out of the purview of the Armed Forces Special Power Act.
Now, it is in force only in a few districts.
Left Wing Extremism, Maoism have been bleeding the country.
Violent incidents, people fleeing from homes and hiding in forests were a matter of daily occurrence.
The work on finding a solution to put an end to left wing extremism from those districts is progressing rapidly.
Brothers and Sisters, regarding Jammu & Kashmir, the path shown by Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji is the right one.
We want to move ahead on that road.
Whether it is Ladakh or Jammu or Srinagar valley.
The biggest thing is that during the past one year village headmen from Jammu and Kashmir in large numbers have been meeting me with the request to hold Panchayat elections there.
The elections could not be held for some reason or the other.
That is why we are moving forward in the direction of holding Panchayat elections and election to City Councils.
Brothers and Sisters, we have to take the country to new heights.
Our motto is “Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikaas’.
There is no discrimination based on yours or mine and no nepotism.
Let every Indian have a house of his own – Housing for All.
Every house should have electricity connection, power for all.
Every Indian should have enough water to meet his needs and that is why there is the scheme for Water for All.
Every Indian should get internet services so, Connectivity for All; we want to take the country forward by following this mantra.
I am impatient as several countries have gone ahead of us, I am restless and impatient to take my country ahead of all these countries.
Come, let’s say aloud the Mantra of ‘Jai Hind’!

I pray that his soul attains eternal peace.
My thoughts are with the countless people inspired by Dayananda Saraswati ji.
The book is a commemoration of the brave CRPF personnel who laid down their lives in the line of duty.
The theme of the Forum, “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World” is both thoughtful and apt.
The existing and emerging challenges to the contemporary international system and global governance architecture deserve serious attention of leaders, governments, policy makers, corporates and civil societies around the world.
In recent years, India’s engagement with the outside world has become truly and effectively multi-dimensional covering the political, economic, people to people, security and other spheres.
In his intervention, the Prime Minister thanked various participants for their suggestions and observations.
This he said, results in government programmes being relatively inactive in the productive pre-monsoon months.
This game-changing reform will result in significant ease of doing business as well as reduction in the overall tax burden on the consumers and the common people.

b) The Central Government will give approximately Rs 18,276 crores as interest subvention for 2016-17.

Here is the complete transcript of the Prime Minister’s interview with Arnab Goswami.
ARNAB: This is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister.
And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country.
So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.
PM MODI: The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.
You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun.
And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card.
Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?
I had not been there before.
So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM.
The work of the government of India was also new for me.
But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it’s not on one subject.
You can pick up any aspect of the government’s functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored.
There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area.
There is an effort to bring in change in every area.
One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP.
The office was new, the questions were also new.
But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment.
The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not.
This was the situation then.
The entire system was engulfed in disappointment.
The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens.
It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it.
But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment.
The intention to do something is visible.
For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk.
But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable.
So that’s the process I started for awakening the confidence.
And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen.
While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government.
Only then will you know where we were and where we are now.
In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest.
On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them.
A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran.
So, you have balanced very diverse forces.
PM MODI: Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy.
For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable.
For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn’t given the opportunity to form the government.
The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country.
Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India.
This is the biggest benefit.
Secondly, the world didn’t know me.
The world wants to know who the head of the state is.
If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi.
If this happens, the country will be at a loss.
Modi’s personality shouldn’t be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india.
I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.
ARNAB: You were an unknown entity in foreign policy
PM MODI: More than foreign policy it was foreign relations.
Yes, I was new to it.
So for me, being pro active was mandatory.
Thirdly, we work as a team.
Foreign ministry, Prime Minister’s officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces.
The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team.
All teams work in a particular direction.
That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered.
We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else.
This disunity has had a negative impact.
Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar.
Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers.
India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake.
So we need to understand this.
We also need to understand that we shouldn’t consider smaller countries insignificant.
I abide by this principle.
The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations.
We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations.
I brought about a change in this.
You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations.
We have had two meetings.
I went there once and they came here once.
These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh.
But these small island nations are most affected by global warming.
They are 50 in number now.
A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India.
ARNAB: That is apparent.
You have a very aggressive foreign policy.
PM MODI: Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office.
Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership.
The process has begun on a positive note.
Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forward
ARNAB: Is it the problem of mindset with China?
There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government.
The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent.
You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India’s UN bid to ban him.
In foreign policy it’s not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation.
Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome.
I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions.
On some issues, it’s a question of principles for them.
On some issues, it’s a question of principles for us.
On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them.
There are some basic differences.
They are a different country, we are a different country
We have to sit and talk with every country.
It’s our ongoing effort
They also appreciated it.
Was the speech impromptu?
PM MODI: I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thing
ARNAB: Why do you say that?
PM MODI: In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it.
ARNAB: Have you become more conscious now?
PM MODI: I am not conscious.
I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear.
Everyone is scared.
I am in fear.
My speeches used be humourous.
I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too.
It is a matter of concern.
I will quote one proverb.
ARNAB: Yes, go ahead.
PM MODI: Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation.
The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.
ARNAB: But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime Minister
PM MODI: But it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype.
Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue.
ARNAB: Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?
PM MODI: I am talking about what’s happening here
At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally?
What is your own world view on that?
PM MODI: I would especially like to appeal to my country’s media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the prism of Pakistan.
India is an independent country.
It is a country of 125 crore people.
Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests.
There should be no compromise on our interests.
We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental points
ARNAB: How close can we get to them?
PM MODI: There has been warmth in our relationship.
You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country.
One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama’s foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India.
This has been said
ARNAB: What you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?
PM MODI: The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world.
The world is interconnected and interdependent.
Now the times have changed
ARNAB: Mr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left.
We were discussing the issue of Pakistan.
You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan.
Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them.
And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities.
It’s true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful.
We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful.
The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case.
So what is the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?
PM MODI: The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the ‘Lakshman Rekha’.
Will it be with the elected government or with other actors?
And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond.
The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees.
It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life.
We have taken up construction of toilets.
I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother.
It’s estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease.
The main reason for disease is filth.
The poor suffer the most from the filth.
Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country.
The young have their aspirations.
You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year.
The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year.
The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year.
The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now.
All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India.
Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results.
You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment.
Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?
PM MODI: The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country.
We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high.
But where will they get employment?
Investment will come in.
It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector.
Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna.
When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people.
If there were two employed earlier, now there are three.
Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work.
Now all this is not in the Labour Department’s registration.
So won’t the employment increase?
ARNAB: So is your focus on entrepreneurship?
PM MODI: Our focus is on all aspects.
Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house.
Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment.
The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices.
This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact.
Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses.
The price of tomatoes was also rising.
Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year.
Global oil prices have fallen.
Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?
Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments.
That is also an area of concern.
We gave special incentives for pulses.
We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad.
There was commentary that it may effect India’s image, perception as a global economy.
So all the misconceptions have been dispelled.
It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post.
Therefore, it’s not like the nation won’t get Raghuram Rajan’s services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person.
He is a person who loves the country.
Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him.
My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done.
And my good wishes will always be with him
ARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, there’s a question related to this.
You said, ‘Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.’
Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan’s context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments.
ARNAB: That’s a very clear message.
PM MODI: I have a very clear message.
I have no two minds about it.
ARNAB: And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister.
I think that answer takes me to the next subject.
We have to look at the background.
It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas.
It’s a common perception.
Even if I look at it from the common man’s perspective, I also wonder where does this money go?
This issue was always stalled in the Parliament.
It’s after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there’s something wrong.
Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda.
Even today I can say…that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue.
But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and there
ARNAB: And you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip service
PM MODI: The result was that people got several chances to launder money.
Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court’s 2011 order.
This shows our sincerity.
Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit.
Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum.
It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders.
And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack.
The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created.
We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India.
I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue.
It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route.
This was discussed.
All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace.
This is not a one sided fight.
ARNAB: When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.
PM MODI: That is something the opposition raises during elections.
Let them have some issue to talk about
ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years.
And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.
PM MODI: Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people.
ARNAB: Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out.
There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously.
This question is important because this isn’t just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country.
Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?
PM MODI: There are many things which are not visible.
One can’t imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt.
One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web.
They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds.
They are very experienced and knowledgeable.
And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn’t have been done without a shield.
Now, agencies are probing.
Let’s see how far the probe goes.
But the investigation shouldn’t go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone.
The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way.
Whatever comes out, will be put out
I felt some of it was impromptu.
And then you said, ‘You are not alone.
Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.’
You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner.
You referred to the Upper House.
There was a lot of response on that too.
Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking.
But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people’s minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam.
How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets?
If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?
PM MODI: I look at it differently.
I believe there have been a lot of problems.
Whether the fault is ours or their’s, I ‘ll leave it to the people.
People will decide.
But because of discussions in Parliament – we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that.
But at least there should be a discussion.
The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don’t let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy.
Whether the government’s work is accomplished or not, I don’t see it as a cause of worry.
It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside.
It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power.
This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed.
As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions.
I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them.
Key members of the government are also in touch.
And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved.
In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha.
So the pace has picked up.
When people say ‘Opposition’, it is unfair to the opposition.
There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions.
So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us — when some people do this, it is wrong.
There is one party which has problems.
And the whole world knows that party.
Secondly, to say that ‘When you were is Opposition, you did it this way’ There is a difference between every Opposition party.
We can’t behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.’
A party which hasn’t been in power or hasn’t seen anything, could behave in this way.
For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party.
So, in 2040 we can’t have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.
ARNAB: Congress is a very experienced and old party
PM MODI: That’s why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn’t be doing this.
If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand.
Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn’t be doing such things
It unifies the country.
Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill.
The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states.
This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest.
There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige.
Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor.
You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion.
In the previous session we introduced an act.
Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund.
Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states.
States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants.
The bill is meant for that.
Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests.
A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed.
There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year.
But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore.
The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals.
PM MODI: The Prime Minister cannot answer this question.
Those creating obstructions can only answer this question.
But despite this, I will keep trying.
I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible.
If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that.
My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.
ARNAB: You spoke of Uttar Pradesh.
Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months.
The focus of entire nation will be on it.
You are the MP from Varanasi.
But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well.
Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda?
PM MODI: It’s my conviction, it’s my commitment.
The new generation of the country only believes in development.
I believe that solution to all problems is in development.
Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about.
If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there’s food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end.
And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development.
So that there is no politics in the name of religion
ARNAB: We don’t make them heroes, we make them villains.
PM MODI: But why do you make them so big?
ARNAB: Self styled spokesmen
PM MODI: I don’t know why such people are encouraged
ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, let’s talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections.
After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal.
After that we will talk about Punjab.
Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh.
Then there is the Gujarat state election.
Don’t you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle?
We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode.
Is this a good thing?
Should we break away from it?
And what is your view on it?
PM MODI: See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister.
And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.
But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal.
After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat.
I had also reached at the same time.
While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together.
Everyone said it.
After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other.
One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of elections
ARNAB: Was that leader from your party?
PM MODI: No, he was not from my party.
So I said that discussion should happen.
What is wrong in that?
Then one day I said that this was being talked about.
I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that.
Neither the government can do this.
There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections.
The Indian voter today is very mature.
He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections.
We have seen this.
In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections.
The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi.
So this country’s voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity.
There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward.
Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable.
When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states.
This could be happening in every state.
So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of.
I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward.
They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of it
ARNAB: Can there be a timebound resolution in this?
PM MODI: The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this.
The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this.
Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country.
This shows the difference
ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays?
So I keep doing that
As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it.
In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that ‘this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.’
The farmers’ crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality.
I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you’ve faced it, you’ve talked about it.
We have linked our entire future to the monsoons.
How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?
PM MODI: We will have to put stress on water management here.
You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues.
During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each.
The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes.
But I didn’t do that.
I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states.
I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer.
We will reap its benefits this monsoon.
Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that.
Micro irrigation is stressed upon.
Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation.
Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used.
Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it.
If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved.
After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers.
The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest.
The farmers will get an assurance.
Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds.
But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer.
Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they’re cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn’t been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet.
Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept.
Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone.
Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold.
Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it.
Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at.
Next point is about, food processing, value addition.
We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing.
For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it.
The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice.
In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice.
If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn’t go waste.
We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme.
So much of our land has been damaged.
We have brought in Soil Health Card.
We have a Soil Health Abhiyan.
The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it.
Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand.
On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000.
So we have brought in scientific methods.
Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea.
PM MODI: See agriculture is a state subject.
PM MODI: This has become too long.
ARNAB: I’ll club these two (questions) together.
Actually there are three, if you allow me.
They’re short questions.
First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind?
In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge.
Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?
PM MODI: Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister.
Apart from elections, I don’t get involved into politics ever.
If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics.
If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies.
My focus is on governance.
Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections.
Governments must not run only for elections.
The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people.
Elections should just be a bi-product.
It is a democracy.
Winning and losing is a part of it.
It shouldn’t be hyped.
You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September.
I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday.
Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you’d face problems?
ARNAB: This was also a warning in a way.
My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves.
I have already given this warning.
I have handled my officers first.
It took me quite some time.
You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues.
This isn’t a small issue.
People who weren’t transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred.
So, one, my focus is on my system.
Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country.
It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee.
But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue.
I don’t want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly.
There is no need to increase the taxes.
The country can run without troubling the citizens.
I am working towards it.
That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000.
If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn’t be worried.
After 30th September, the government will have to take steps.
I will not worry about the polls.
I will take the necessary steps.
I want to work for the poor in my country.
If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200.
I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead.
We need to run a lot to match that level.
So we do not need to calculate.
We just need to give it all in.
And I have given myself in completely.
I’ve been successful is pulling my entire government in.
I believe that the country is also committed to move forward
First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace?
What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?
PM MODI: Firstly, I don’t live under the burden of worries.
Problems and challenges are there, you can’t deny that.
But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries.
I like to face the problems.
I don’t run away from them.
Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it.
But I can’t leave the country helpless.
This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so.
For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility.
I do not regret anything.
I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it.
Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them.
Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji.
A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan.
People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration.
I look at them and I work even harder.
I am grateful for this interview.
PM MODI: Thank you
ARNAB: Please do not think like that.
Thank you very much
PM MODI: Thanks a lot.

Good Morning Friends,
Usually the season of winter also starts with Diwali.
However, this is the impact of Global Warming and Climate Change that one does not feel the intense cold these days.
However, our Winter Session is getting started.
And I believe that in this Winter Session, that is beginning in 2017 and will continue in 2018, several important issues of the government, that have far reaching impact, will be brought before the Parliament.
I am confident of it, and even yesterday we had an ‘All Party meeting’ in which there was a common voice that the session of the parliament should be utilised in the proper manner for taking the country forward.
The Prime Minister said India is proud of its diversity, and occasions such as “Run For Unity” offer us an opportunity to reinforce that sense of pride and oneness.
The Prime Minister administered a pledge to the participants.
You all are welcome to the Winter Session.
This session is important.
I hope that we all strive towards accomplishing the maximum possible tasks that are of public importance and significant to the country for the welfare of the people and the country.
I believe that all the members of the House will move ahead with this spirit.
We have been relentlessly striving to have discussions on different issues.
The discussion could be an open one and a heated one but it must take place.
There might be debates, discussions and conversations but I would like to request the House to work even beyond the stipulated time and all the important subjects of discussion must reach to a conclusion.
Efforts should be towards making the discussion more meaningful and robust.
May this spirit grow further in the coming years”, the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister mentioned that he cherished both the warm reception he had received during those visits and the fruitful discussions then and in his other meetings with the President in Tehran (May 2016) and Tashkent (June 2016).
Both leaders expressed their happiness at the close and regular consultations between India and Afghanistan at all levels, which have served to guide their strategic partnership and strengthen all-round cooperation.
Recalling that India-Afghanistan bilateral development cooperation has assisted Afghanistan’s own efforts for successful political, security and economic transitions, the two leaders noted with happiness the recent completion of major milestones such as Parliament Building and the Afghanistan-India Friendship Dam.
The President stressed the significance of the Prime Minister’s assurance conveyed during the joint inauguration of Storay Palace on 22 August 2016 via a video link that 1.25 billion people of India firmly stand with their Afghan brothers and sisters.
The Prime Minister reiterated India’s abiding support for a unified, sovereign, democratic, peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan.
He conveyed India’s readiness to consider further requirements of Afghanistan for capacity and capability building in spheres such as education, health, agriculture, skill development, empowerment of women, energy, infrastructure and strengthening of democratic institutions.

Sardar Patel formulated solutions one by one, weaving the warp & weft of unity on the axis of a single thread.
Whether Junagadh, Hyderabad, Travancore, or for that matter the princely states of Rajasthan, if we are able to see a United India now, it was entirely on account of the sagacity & strategic wisdom of Sardar Patel.
It is but natural for us to solemnly remember SardarVallabhbhai Patel as we exalt the spirit of unity that binds our Nation, our Mother India.
I hope every Indian being will swell with pride on this remarkable feat of mother India… and will sing paeans of glory in its praise with the head held high.
I am sure this will turn out to be a described destination for one & all across the country.
But, do you know why we Indian citizens commemorate this day as Infantry Day?

Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea;
Minister for Commerce & Industry, Government of India;
President and CEO of the Chosun-ilboGroup;
Business Leaders of Korea and India;
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am very happy to be here with you.
Such a large gathering of Korean companies in India is actually a global story.
I take this opportunity to welcome all of you to India.
The relationship between India and Korea dates back centuries.
It is believed that an Indian Princess travelled to Korea and became a queen in Korea.
We are also bound by our Buddhist traditions.
Our Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore composed a poem – ‘Lamp of the East’ – in 1929 about Korea’s glorious past and its bright future.
Bollywood films are also very popular in Korea.
And at the Pro-Kabaddi league in India a few months ago, some of the loudest cheers, were reserved for a Korean Kabaddi player.
It is also a good co-incidence that India and South Korea both celebrate their Independence Day on the 15th of August.
From Princess to poetry and from Buddha to Bollywood; we have so much in common.
As I have mentioned earlier, I have always been fascinated by Korea.
I visited Korea when I was Chief Minister of Gujarat.
I used to wonder how a country of the size of Gujarat can make such economic progress.
I admire the spirit of enterprise of the Korean people.
I admire the way in which they have created and sustained their global brands.
Korean companies are appreciated for their innovation, and strong manufacturing capability.
It is heartening to note that our bilateral trade crossed 20 billion dollars last year, for the first time in six years.
My visit in 2015 led to a positive focus on India.
Your open market policies have found resonance with India’s economic liberalization and ‘Look East Policy’.
Over 500 Korean companies are operating in India too.
In fact, many of your products are house-hold names in India.
However, South Korea ranks only 16th in FDI Equity inflows to India.
India offers a lot of potential for the Korean Investors with its huge market and enabling policy environment.
Since many of you are already present in India, you already know the ground realities.
Also, through your interaction with Indian CEOs, you must have already discovered the direction in which India is going.
However, let me take a few more minutes.
I would like to use this occasion to personally invite to India those who are not yet present here.
If you see around the globe, there are very few countries where you have three important factors of economy together.
They are: Democracy, Demography and Demand.
In India, we have all the three together.
By Democracy, I mean the system based on liberal values which ensures free and fair play towards one and all.
By Demography, I mean a vast and talented pool of young and energetic workforce.
By Demand, I mean a big and growing market for goods and services.
A rising middle class is creating further growth in the domestic market.
We have worked towards creating a stable business environment, ensuring the rule of law, and removing arbitrariness in decision making.
We seek positivity in day to day transactions.
We are widening the areas of trust; rather than digging into doubts.
This represents a complete change of the Government’s mindset.
A shift from issuing authority to business partner to achieve ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.
And when this happens, simplification of rules and procedures starts automatically.
After all, this is what Ease of doing business demands through such measures, we are now working towards ‘Ease of Living”.
We are on a de-regulation and de-licensing drive.
Nearly 65 percent to 70 percent of the items previously under licensing can now be produced without a license.
We have said that factory inspections will only be need-based and only on authorization of the higher authority.
In Dime are one of the most open countries now.
Most of the sectors of our economy are open for FDI.
There is practically no requirement of Government approval for investments in manufacturing sector except for Defense sector.
Incorporating a company along with allotment of statutory numbers is now just a one day affair.
We have carried out thousands of reforms on the business, investment, governance and cross border trading front.
Some of them like GST are historic.
Many of you might already be experiencing the ease in operations due to GST.
FDI inflows have grown the most in the last three years.
There is a new energy and vibrancy in the domestic industry.
A new start up eco-system has been un-veiled.
With unique ID and mobile phone penetration, we are fast moving towards becoming a Digital Economy.
Our, strategy is to leverage the strength of hundreds of millions of Indians who have come online in recent years.
Thus, a New India is emerging which will be modern and competitive and yet caring and compassionate.
On the global platform.
India has climbed 42 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index in the last three years.
We moved up 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank.
We have improved 31 places in last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum.
We have also moved up twenty one places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in two years.
We are among the top 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD.
Ours is a globally cost competitive manufacturing eco-system.
We have a vast pool of skilled professionals with knowledge and energy.
Now, we have a world class engineering education base and strong R&D facilities.
An informal economy into a formal economy, you can imagine the range and span of our work.
We are already the third-largest economy by purchasing power.
Very soon, we will become the world’s fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP.
We are also the fastest growing major economy of the world today.
We are also a country with the one of the largest Start up eco-systems.
Our vision is to create a globally competitive industry and services base equipped with skill, speed and scale.
We particularly want to promote manufacturing in a big way to create jobs for our youth.
For this purpose, we have launched a campaign called “Make in India”.
This includes bringing our industrial infrastructure, policies and practices to best global standards and to convert India into a global manufacturing hub.
This initiative has been well supplemented by programmers like ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’.
Cleaner and greener development and Zero defect Zero effect manufacturing is another commitment.
We have committed to the world and are moving aggressively for adoption of better environmental technologies.
Your car making and our designing capabilities can be put together.
Though we have become the third biggest producer of steel, we need to add lot of value in it.
Your steel-making capacity and our resources of iron ore can be put together for better products.
Similarly, your ship-building capacity and our agenda of port led development can become a driver of our partnership.
India and Korea are major economies in the region.
Our partnership has immense potential to promote regional growth, development, stability and prosperity in Asia.
India is turning to the East for bigger economic engagement.
Similarly, South Korea is trying to diversify its overseas markets.
Both stand to gain by deepening their partnership.
India a huge and emerging market.
It can also be a bridge for Korean business to penetrate the Middle East and African markets.
You may recollect that the need for a hand-holding agency was felt during my visit to Korea.
It was announced that a dedicated team would be established for Korean Investments in India.
Accordingly, “Korea Plus” was formed in June 2016.
The mandate of Korea Plus is to promote, facilitate and retain Korean investments in India.
It is envisaged as the first reference point for Korean Investors in India.
Korea Plus has facilitated more than 100 Korean Investors in a short span of about two years.
It acts as a partner throughout the investment cycle of Korean companies.
This shows our commitment towards welcoming Korean people and companies; ideas and investments.
India is now a free destination for enterprise.
You will not find such a free and growing market anywhere in the world.
I further assure you that whatever is required to promote and protect your investments will be done here.
Because we value your involvement and contribution in our economy.
At a personal level too, I assure you of my full support whenever required.
In his remarks at the meeting, the Prime Minister stressed on the need for proper skill mapping and identification of the future requirements for skills, so that school-children and parents are well aware of the emerging trends in the job market.
Further, he said a similar exercise should also be done to map the skilled manpower requirements at the global level, so that India can meet the global requirement of skilled workforce.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of imbibing safety norms and soft skills as integral parts of skill development.

In the 1500 meter race, Abdellatif Baka of Algeria set a new record by completing the 1500 meters race taking 1.7 seconds less than the time taken by the gold medalist in the same event at the general Olympics.
My dear countrymen, we had launched ‘Swachha Bharat Mission’ two years ago on 2nd October, the birth anniversary of our revered Bapu.
And, with this in view ‘Open Defecation Free’ or ODF Campaign has been launched.
This year a special programme ‘INDOSAN’ – India Sanitation Conference is being organized from 25th September to 2nd October.
In the coming October month, from 1st October to 15th October, Drinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department and Rural Development Department – these three are going to work under a designated roadmap in their respective areas.
Then during last two weeks of October from 16th October to 31st October, three more departments, namely – Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Food Processing Industries and Consumer Affairs are going to take up cleanliness campaigns in the concerned areas.
Now, many youngsters, small groups, people from the corporate world, schools and some NGOs are jointly going to organize ‘Joy of Giving Week’ from 2nd October to 8th October.

Conclusion of the Bilateral Technical Arrangement (BTA) has been linked to the Visa Free Agreement for holders of Diplomatic passports as a package deal.
The BTA essentially aims to formalise the existing procedure for cooperation on the return of irregular migrants between the two countries without introducing any additional obligations or exacting timeframes.
It is noteworthy that the estimated number of irregular migrants in Switzerland who are thought to be from India is less than 100.
If the BTA with Switzerland is approved as proposed, it would offer an opportunity to use the same as a model template for negotiations on the subject with other EU countries, which have been raising the issue regularly with us.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the acquisition by the State Bank of India of its subsidiary banks namely State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Travancore.

The acquisition under Section 35 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955 will result in the creation of a stronger merged entity.
This will minimize vulnerability to any geographic concentration risks faced by subsidiary banks.
The acquisition of subsidiary banks of State Bank is an important step towards strengthening the banking sector through consolidation of public sector banks.

The MoU was signed on 8th April, 2.017.

Dear friends!
I welcome you at the launch of the Russian-Indian enterprise for production of Kalashnikov assault rifles.
Military and technical cooperation has traditionally been one of the key areas of special and privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India.
For more than seven decades, we have been supplying reliable and high-quality armaments and equipment to Indian friends.
Around 170 military and industrial facilities have been set up in India with assistance from our country.
The new joint venture will manufacture world famous Kalashnikov assault rifles of the newest 200 series and eventually will reach full localization of production.
Thus, the Indian defence-industrial sector will have the opportunity to fulfill the needs of national security agencies in this category of small arms, resting upon advanced Russian technologies.
In this regard, I would like to express gratitude to Russian and Indian specialists, to all those who so promptly made this project happen.
I am convinced that commissioning of the new enterprise will contribute to stronger defence potential of India, to further advance of the scientific and industrial basis of the national economy, will be instrumental in terms of creating new jobs for qualified work force, and will provide an impetus to professional education and personnel training.
The plant itself will become another symbol of friendship and constructive cooperation between our two countries.
I wish you every success and all the best.

We are fortunate to have in our cultural and historical heritage from a Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan.
From the ramparts of Red Fort, on behalf of our 125 crore countrymen, I bow and pay respects to all those men and women who have sacrificed their lives, who have undergone immense sufferings and made sacrifices for the independence, glory and pride of the country.
Sometimes, natural calamities are a big challenge for us.
A good monsoon contributes immensely to the prosperity of the country.
However, due to climate change, sometimes it turns into a natural calamity.
Several parts of the country faced natural calamities recently.
Besides our innocent children lost their lives in a hospital.
Our 125 crore countrymen stand shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of crisis and grief.
I assure the countrymen that in this hour of crisis we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the wellbeing of all.
My dear countrymen, this year is a special year for independent India.
We commemorated 75 years of Quit India Movement last week.
This year we are also commemorating the centenary of Champaran Satyagrah and the Sabarmati Ashram.
The centenary of Lokmanya Tilak’s call “Swaraj is my birth right” falls this year as well.
The year marks the 125th Anniversary of the Ganesh Utsav which led to the rise of community awakening through the celebrations.
It inspires us to dedicate ourselves to a cause for the country.
We now have five years before we reach the 75th year of our independence.
Our united resolve, strength and determination to work hard remembering the memory of our great patriots will help us to build an India of their dreams by 2022.
Therefore, we have to take the country forward with a pledge to build a New India.
When Lord Rama had to go to Lanka, the monkeys of vanar sena came to his help, Ramsetu was built and Lord Rama could reach Lanka.
Then there was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who empowered his countrymen to weave the fabric of independence with cotton and spinning wheel.
The collective resolve and strength of the people got freedom for our country.
No one is small or big.
We have in our memory the story of squirrel which became an agent of change.
That’s why we must remember that no one among the 1.25 billion people is either small or big – everyone is equal.
If each one of us, irrespective of where he belongs to, strives with a new resolve, a new energy, a new strength, we can change the face of the country with our combined strength in the 75th year of our independence in 2022.
It will be the New India – a secure, prosperous and strong nation.
A New India where there is equal opportunity for all; where modern science and technology play an important role in bringing glory for the nation in the global arena.
We know it well that at the time of the freedom movement, the teacher who was engaged in teaching, the farmer who was tilling his land, the laborer who was working – all of them knew in their hearts that whatever they were doing, was contributing towards the independence of the country.
This idea is a great source of strength.
In the family, food is prepared everyday but it becomes ‘prasad’ only when it is offered to the deity.
You have an opportunity to shape the destiny of our country.
When Arjuna was posing a lot of queries to Lord Krishna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, then Krishna told Arjuna that you achieve goals as per your thinking and beliefs.
We have a strong determination, we are committed for a brighter India.
We, who have grown up with a state of hopelessness, have to reject the feeling of despair and must now march ahead with confidence.
We have to leave this ‘Chalta Hai’ attitude.
Be it Left-Wing-Extremism, be it terrorism, be it infiltrators, be it the elements fomenting trouble inside our country- the uniformed forces of our country have made extreme sacrifices.
And when the surgical strike was carried out, then the world had to acknowledge India’s capability and strength.
Be it our coast line or our borders, the space or the cyberspace, India is capable of ensuring its own security and strong enough to ward off any threats against the country.
Due to this, the confidence of the hardworking and honest person is increasing.
An honest man now feels that his honesty matters.
Today, we are celebrating a festival of honesty and there is no place for dishonesty.
In such a short time, the government has confiscated Benami properties worth over Rs.800 crores.
When these things happen, the common man develops faith that the country is for the honest persons.
The ‘One Rank – One Pension’ policy for our defence forces was stuck up for 30-40 years.
Our government implemented it.
When we fulfill the aspirations of our soldiers, then their morale goes high and their resolve to protect the nation grows manifold.
The country has many states and a Central Government.
The success of GST can be attributed to the hard work that has been put in to make it a success.
Technology has made it look like a miracle.
The global community is surprised how we were able to roll out GST in such a short time.
It is a reflection of our capability and helps in building the confidence and faith of the future generations.
Today roads are being built at twice the speed.
The railway tracks are being laid at double the speed.
More than 14 thousand villages that were hitherto shrouded in darkness even after Independence, have been provided with electricity.
Bank accounts of 29 crore people have been opened, more than 9 crore farmers have got Soil Health Card.
More than 2 crore poor mothers and sisters are no longer using the fuel wood and using LPG gas stove NOW.
The poor tribals have gained faith in the system.
The person at the last mile of development now joins the mainstream and the nation is marching ahead.
More than 8 crore loans have been sanctioned without guarantee to the youth for self-employment.
The interest on bank loans have been lowered.
If a person belonging to the middle-class wants to build his house, then he gets a loan at a lower rate of interest.
I can provide many such instances of Good Governance, simplifying the process of Governance.
By reiterating this we have enforced faster decision making.
And that is why 125 crore countrymen have been able to repose faith in our governance.
You will be happy to know that we are not alone in our fight against terrorism.
Many nations are proactively supporting us.
Be it Hawala, or any inputs related to terrorism, the global community is supporting us with critical information.
We have joined hands with other nations in the combined fight against terrorism.
I extend my heartfelt greetings to all those countries who are standing in solidarity with us and acknowledge our prowess.
For the development and progress of Jammu & Kashmir, its prosperity, and fulfilment of the aspirations of the citizens, not only the J&K government, but we as responsible citizens also have a responsibility.
We are committed to restore the state to its former glory so as to experience the paradise that it was, once again.
On Kashmir there is rhetoric and politics.
But I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people.
Such is the legacy of 125 crore Indians.
Hence, neither by abuse nor by bullets, change will come by embracing all.
And we are moving forward with this resolve.
We shall take strict steps against terrorism.
There is no question of being soft on terrorism or terrorists.
We have been asking the extremists to join the mainstream.
Democracy provides an equal opportunity and rights to be heard for all.
The process of engagement can take place only by their joining the mainstream.
Security forces are keeping a tight vigil on our borders.
I am delighted to announce that today the Indian Government is launching a website which will give an account of the valour of the Gallantry Award winners.
A portal is also being launched which aims to provide the entire details of these brave hearts who have brought pride to the nation.
The story of sacrifices made will certainly inspire the younger generations.
With the help of technology, we are trying to promote honesty and transparency in the country.
Our fight against black money will continue; our fight against corruption will continue.
With the intervention of technology, slowly we are trying to link Aadhaar with the system.
We have been successful in infusing transparency in the system.
People from around the world have appreciated this model and have been studying it.
A common man living thousands of kilometres away can now supply his products to the Government.
He doesn’t need any middle man.
We have launched a portal called “GEM”.
The Government is making procurement through this portal.
We have been successful in bringing transparency at various levels.
When a work is delayed, it is not only the project that is delayed.
It is not a matter of expenditure of money.
When a work is stalled, the poor families are the ones who suffer the most.
We can reach the planet Mars within 9 months; we are capable of achieving that.
I review Government Projects every month.
My brothers and sisters,
When a country that is capable of reaching Mars within 9 months, how is it possible that it is not able to lay 70-72 Kilometres railway lines for 42 long years.
It sets in doubts in the minds of the poor.
We have taken care of all these things.
Hence , we laid emphasis on Co-operative Federalism.
Now we are moving towards a Competitive Co-operative Federalism.
You must have seen that we are taking all the decisions together.
You may recall that one of our Prime Ministers in his address from the ramparts of Red Fort had talked about the poor state of affairs of the power supply companies of the country.
He expressed his concerns over the issue.
Today with the “UDAY” Yojana, we have worked together to resolve the issues with these power companies.
It is a concrete example of federalism in its real sense.
Whether it is GST or Smart City Project, whether it is Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or construction of toilets, or ease of doing business, all these are being accomplished by working together shoulder to shoulder with the States.
My dear fellow countrymen,
In the New India, the biggest strength is democracy.
However, democracy cannot be confined only to ballot boxes.
Hence our resolve is to see to it that we have a democracy in New India, where people are not driven by the system, rather the system is driven by the people.
In Independent India our Mantra should be “Good Governance is my birthright”.
‘Suraja’ or Good Governance should be our collective responsibility.
The citizens should fulfil their duties and the Government too should discharge its responsibilities.
When we move from “Swaraj” to “Suraja”, the citizens do not lag behind.
For example, when I called upon the countrymen to give up gas subsidy, the nation responded as a whole.
I have spoken about cleanliness.
Now people are joining hands from every part of the country to take up this cleanliness drive forward.
When demonetization was announced, the world was surprised.
People thought that this was the end of Modi.
But the way our 125 crore countrymen had shown patience and faith, we were able to take one after another step in our drive against corruption.
Our farmers have not looked back since then.
They are now producing record harvests and scaling new heights despite facing natural adversities.
There has been a record production of pulses this year.
My dear brothers and sisters,
India never had the tradition to import pulses and if it had to import on rare occasions, it was only a few thousand tons.
This year when they produced 16 lakh tons of pulses to provide nutrition to the poor, the government took the historic step of encouraging them by buying their produce.
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna has provided a security cover to our farmers.
Three years back, this scheme which was running under a different name earlier, covered only 3.25 crore farmers.
Now over a short span of three years more farmers have been brought under its ambit.
The number is soon going to touch the 5.75 crore mark.
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna aims to meet the demand of water of the farmers.
If my farmers get water, they can produce rich harvests from their fields.
That is why I had made some announcements from the ramparts of Red Fort on the last Independence Day.
Out of those, we have completed 21 projects and remaining 50 would be completed soon.
I have resolved to complete 99 big projects.
By completing those 99 big projects before 2019, we shall fulfill our commitment.
We cannot change the lot of our farmers until we hand hold him from procuring seeds to ensure that his produce reaches the market.
For this we need infrastructure and supply chain.
Every year vegetables, fruits and grains worth lakhs of crores of rupees are wasted.
In order to change the situation, the government has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment in food processing sector.
Due to this, systems shall be put in place that will ensure hand-holding of the farmers from supplying seeds to marketing his produce.
Such arrangements will usher in a new change in the lives of crores of our farmers.
The Government has launched several new initiatives in the employment related schemes and also in the manner in which the training is imparted for the development of human resource according to the needs of the 21st century.
We have launched a massive program to provide collateral free loans to the youth.
Our youth should become independent, he should get the employment, he should become the provider of employment.
Over the past three years, ‘Pradhanmantri Mudra Yojana’ has led to millions and millions of youth becoming self-dependent.
It’s not just that, one youth is providing employment to one, two or three more people.
We have asked 20 universities to decide their own destiny.
The government will not interfere in their functioning.
Besides, the government is willing to provide funds up to Rs. 1,000 crores.
We have appealed to them and I am confident that the education institutions of our country will certainly come forward and make it a success.
Over the last three years, we have set up 6 IITs, 7 new IIMs and 8 new IIITs and we have also done the groundwork for linking the education with job opportunities.
My mothers and sisters, the women in the families seek employment in large numbers.
And therefore we have taken a very important step to reform the labour laws to provide them the employment opportunities in the night also.
Our mothers and sisters are an integral unit of our families.
Their contribution in making our future is extremely important.
And that is why we have decided to increase the paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from the earlier 12 weeks.
In the context of women empowerment, I’d like to honour those sisters who have been forced to lead a very difficult life due to ‘Triple Talaq’.
There is no recourse for them, and such victims of ‘Triple Talaq’ have launched a massive movement in the country.
They shook the conscience of the intellectual class of the country, the media of the country also helped them and a movement against ‘Triple Talaq’ was started in the country.
I heartily commend those sisters who have launched this movement, who have been fighting against the ‘Triple Talaq’ and I’m confident that the country will help them in this struggle.
The country will help these mothers and sisters in securing this right.
India will fully support them and they will ultimately achieve success in this very important step in the direction of women empowerment; I am fully confident about this.
This is the land of Gandhi and Buddha, we have to move forward taking everyone along.
This is a part of our country’s culture and tradition.
We have to successfully carry it forward, and that is why in the name of faith, violence cannot be allowed.
If something happens to a patient in a hospital and the hospital is burnt down; some accident happens and the vehicles are burnt down; people launch a movement and the public property is burnt down; is it for a free India?
It is the property of 125 crore Indians.
Whose cultural legacy is this?
This is our cultural legacy, the legacy of 125 crore people.
Whose faith is this?
This is our faith, the faith of 125 crore people; and that is why the path of violence in the name of faith can never succeed in this country.
The country will never accept this.
And that is why I’d like to appeal to all the countrymen that at that time our motto was ‘Bharat Chodo’ and today’s slogan is ‘Bharat Jodo’.
In order to build a prosperous India, we need a strong economy, balanced development and next generation infrastructure.
Some have been noticed, while the rest may not have been noticed.
But one thing is important – when you move towards big changes, you will face hurdles.
But look at the working style of this government; when a train crosses a railway station and changes the track, the speed needs to be reduced from 60 to 30.
The speed of the train decreases while changing the track.
We are trying to put the whole country on a new track without decreasing the speed.
We have maintained the speed.
We are emphasising on all types of modern infrastructure.
It has tremendous potential, rich human resources, immense natural wealth, work force and it has the power to change lives.
We are devoting significant attention to eastern India- Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, and the Northeast.
These parts have to grow further.
After forming the government, our first task was to constitute an SIT.
We have achieved several milestones through demonetization.
The hidden black money has been brought into the formal economy.
According to the research conducted by outside experts, about Rs.3 lakh crores that had never come into the banking system before, has been brought into the system after the demonetization.
More than Rs. 1.75 lakh crores deposited in the banks is under the scanner.
Black money worth Rs. 2 lakh crore had to be deposited in the banks and this system has forced them to be accountable.
In a way it has more than doubled.
Around 4.5 lakh people have now come forward and are trying to trade the right path after accepting their mistakes.
People start speculating about economic meltdown and what not.
You will be surprised to know that black marketers used to own shell companies.
Out of these 3 lakh shell companies, registration of 1.75 lakh companies were cancelled.
Even if five companies shut shop in India, there is huge public outcry.
And here, we have closed one lakh Seventy five thousand companies.
This amounts to 30% increase in his efficiency.
Can you imagine what it means to accomplish 30% more efficiency in the Indian transportation sector?
GST has brought this revolutionary change.
Banks are reducing their interest rates.
Even a common man is able to access inflow of funds through Mudra.
He is getting opportunities to stand on his feet.
The middle class and the underprivileged who aspire to have their own homes someday, are getting loans from the banks at low interest rates.
Such moves are giving a fillip to the economic growth of the country.
Our country boasts of the world’s largest youth population.
India is known in the world for its prowess in IT and Digital World.
Should we still remain in the old mind-set?
Today we have paper-currency.
Slowly this paper-currency will be replaced by the digital currency.
We should lead from the front to make a move towards Digital transactions.
We should adopt BHIM App for transactions and make it a part of our economic activities.
We should also work through prepaid systems.
I am happy that there has been an increase in Digital transactions.
If we succeed in Swachh Bharat, poor will be able to save Rs. 7000 on medicines that they would otherwise have spent.
Earlier there used to be Dialysis only at the State capitals.
Now we have decided to open Dialysis Centres at district level.
We have already opened this facility in 350 to 400 districts where free Dialysis services are available for the poor.
We can take pride in the fact that we have developed various systems to showcase to the world.
We have helped the neighbouring countries by successfully launching SAARC Satellite.
Crores of RuPay Cards are now available in the country.
When all the cards will be operational, it will be the largest number of cards in the world.
My dear countrymen, I shall urge you to take up the New India Pledge and move ahead.
It implies that, if we don’t accomplish a work within the stipulated time then we shall not be able to get the desired results.
So for the ‘Team India’, for the 125 crore countrymen, we have to take the pledge to achieve the goal by 2022.
We will do it with dedication to see a great, majestic India by 2022.
Together we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without worry.
They will earn double by 2022 of what they are earning today.
And that is why my dear fellow countrymen, we will together strive to move ahead in this march towards development.
Let all of us march together with the dream of a building an India of grandeur and majesty as we wait for the 75th year of independence after completing 70 years of Independence in the next five years.
With this thought in mind I once again bow my head before the heroes of our freedom movement.
I bow my head before the new confidence and passion of my 125 crore countrymen and I call upon Team India to march on with this new pledge.
Speaking on the occasion, he said today is a day to look back at the time when Haryana was formed and the aims with which the state was formed.
Haryana is a relatively small state but it has contributed in so many areas, he said.

People of Haryana have given their lives for the nation by serving in the Armed Forces, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that the people of Haryana should think about making the entire State, Open Defecation Free, within this Golden Jubilee year.
May the process of transformation begin in our villages and when this happens, the development of Haryana will receive an impetus, the Prime Minister said.

He said their work is an inspiration for others, and exhorted them to go even further in their respective fields.
Referring to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Prime Minister said that its success is attributable in large measure, to the fact that women have given importance to it.
Mentioning the recently concluded Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, the Prime Minister said that this time, it has been the subject of discussion, because of the high standards of cleanliness and sanitation.
He added that Swachhta has now become a public movement.
Enhanced Recovery, Improved Recovery and exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons are capital intensive, technologically complex and challenging in nature.

Dear countrymen, the entire world will remember 3rd December as “International Day of Persons with Disabilities”.
Last time in ‘Mann ki Baat’ I talked about organ donation.
I talked about the NOTO helpline for ‘Organ donation’.
I have been told that after that session the number of phone calls increased 7 times and the number of hits on the website increased 2.5 times.
27th November was celebrated as ‘Indian Organ Donation Day’.
How does he learn?
The earth’s temperature should not rise anymore.
This is everyone’s concern and responsibility too.
And to save us from rising temperatures, the first step is “energy conservation.

My greetings to the people of China on the occasion of your National Day.
Our relations date back to centuries, encompassing spiritualism, learning, art, trade and respect for each other’s civilisation and shared prosperity.

In recent times, we have deepened our engagement across the full spectrum of our ties, and laid emphasis on deepening mutual trust and confidence, and expansion of people-to-people ties.
And we will continue our endeavours in this direction.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed a Students’ Convention on the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Centenary Celebrations, and 125th Year of Swami Vivekananda’s Chicago Address, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi.
The Prime Minister said that 125 years ago, on the same day that has recently come to be known as 9/11, with just a few words, a youngster from India won over the world and showed the world the power of oneness.
The 9/11 of 1893 was about love, harmony and brotherhood, he added.
The Prime Minister said that Swami Vivekananda raised his voice against the social evils that have entered our society.
He recalled that Swami Vivekananda said that only rituals will not connect an individual to divinity; he said that ‘Jan Seva’ is ‘Prabhu Seva.’
Swami Vivekananda did not believe in sermonising, the Prime Minister said.
His ideas and idealism paved way for an institutional framework through the Ramakrishna Mission, he added.
The Prime Minister specially mentioned all those people who are working tirelessly to keep India clean, noting that they were the ones who had most imbibed the spirit of Vande Mataram.
The correspondence between Swami Vivekananda and Jamsetji Tata will show the concern Swami ji had towards India’s self-reliance, the Prime Minister said.
Both knowledge and skills are equally important, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said, that people now say that the 21st century is Asia’s century.
But long ago, Swami Vivekananda had given the concept of ‘One Asia,’ and said that the solutions to the world’s problems will come from Asia.
There is no better place for creativity and innovation than university campuses, the Prime Minister said, adding that campuses should organize days to celebrate the culture and language of various States, to strengthen the spirit of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.”
I am very happy to be here at the inauguration of the World Sustainable Development Summit.
To those joining us from abroad: Welcome to India.
Welcome to Delhi.
On the side lines of the Summit, I hope you shall have some time to see the history and splendor of this city.
This summit is a re-inforcement of India’s commitment to a sustainable planet, for ourselves and for future generations.
As a nation, we are proud of our long history and tradition of harmonious co-existence between man and nature.
Respect for nature is an integral part of our value system.
Our traditional practices contribute to a sustainable lifestyle.
Our goal is to be able to live up to our ancient texts which say, “Keep pure For the Earth is our Mother and we are her children”.
We believe that all resources and all wealth belongs to Nature and the Almighty.
We are just the trustees or managers of this wealth.
Mahatma Gandhi too, advocated this trusteeship philosophy.
Recently, National Geographic’s Greendex Report of 2014 which assesses the environmental sustainability of consumer choice, ranked India at the top for its greenest consumption pattern.
Over the years, the World Sustainable Development Summit has spread consciousness about our actions to preserve the purity of Mother Earth to all parts of the world.
As the world committed to bring about change, so did we.
While the world was discussing ‘Inconvenient Truth’, we translated it into ‘Convenient Action’.
Friends, it was with this thought that India, along with France, initiated the International Solar Alliance.
It already has one hundred and twenty one members.
It is perhaps, the single most important global achievement after Paris.
Our goal of creating a carbon sink of two point five to three billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030had once seemed difficult to many.
Yet we continue our steady progress on that path.
We are also on track to meet the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution.
The UN Sustainable Development Goals put us on the path of equality, equity and climate justice.
While we are doing everything that is required of us, we expect that others also join in to fulfil their commitments based on Common but Differentiated Responsibility and equity.
We must also stress on climate justice for all vulnerable populations.
We in India are focused on Ease of living –through Good Governance, Sustainable Livelihood and through Cleaner Environment.
The campaign for clean India has moved from the streets of Delhi to every nook and corner of the country.
Cleanliness leads to better hygiene, better health, better working conditions and there-by better income and life.
We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients, instead of burning them.
We are also happy to host the 2018 World Environment Dayton highlight our commitment and our continuing partnership to make the world a cleaner place.
We also recognize the need to tackle the issue of water availability, which is becoming a major challenge.
That is why we have introduced the massive Namami Gange initiative.
This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.
Our country is primarily agrarian.
The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojanahas been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water.
India has a fairly decent report card on bio-diversity conservation.
India has gained international recognition for ten out of its eighteen Biosphere reserves under UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere programme.
This is a testimony that our development is green and our wildlife is robust.
India has always believed in making the benefits of good governance reach everyone.
Our mission of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is an extension of this philosophy.
Through this philosophy, we are ensuring that some of our most deprived areas experience social and economic progress on par with others.
In this day and age, access to electricity and clean cooking solutions are basics that every person must be provided with.
These form the core of any country’s economic development.
Yet, there are many in India and outside who are struggling in the absence of these solutions.
People are forced to use un-healthy cooking techniques that cause indoor air pollution.
I have been told that the smoke in a rural kitchen resulting from this is a serious health hazard.
Yet, few talk about it.
Keeping this in view we have launched two far-reaching initiatives- Ujjwala and Saubhagya.
From the time that they were launched, these schemes have already impacted the lives of millions.
With these twin programs, the time when mothers would fetch dry wood from forests or prepare cow dung cakes, to feed their families will be gone soon.
Soon too, the images of traditional firewood stoves will only remain a picture in our social history texts.
We recognize that only a healthy nation can lead the process of development.
Keeping this in mind, we have launched the world’s largest government funded health scheme.
The programme will support hundred million poor families.
Our ‘Housing for All’ and ‘Power for All ’initiatives also stem from this same agenda of providing the basic amenities of life to those who cannot afford them.
You know that India is one sixth of the global community.
Our development needs are enormous.
Our poverty or prosperity will have direct impact on the global poverty or prosperity.
People in India have waited too long for access to modern amenities and means of development.
We have committed to complete this task sooner than anticipated.
However, we have also said that we will do all this in a cleaner and greener way.
To give you just a few examples.
To give employment to our youth, we have decided to make India a global manufacturing hub.
We have launched the Make in India campaign for this.
However, at the same time, we are insisting on Zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
As the world’s fastest growing major economy, our energy needs are immense.
We have added more than14 Giga-Watts to solar energy generation which was just about three Giga-Watts three years back.
With this, we are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world.
With growing urbanization our transportation needs are growing too.
But we are focusing on mass transportation systems especially metro rail systems.
Even for cargo movement to long distances, we have started working on national water-way systems.
Each of our states is preparing an action plan against climate change.
This will ensure that while we are working towards conserving our environment, we also safe-guard our most vulnerable areas.
We intend to achieve each of our sustainable development objectives on our own, but collaboration remains the key.
Collaboration between governments, between industries, and between people.
The developed world can help us achieve them faster.
Successful climate action needs access to financial resources and technology.
Technology can help countries like India develop sustainably and enable the poor to benefit from it.
We need to understand that this planet, our Mother Earth, is one.
And so, we should rise above our trivial differences of race, religion, and power, and act as one to save her.
With our deep rooted philosophy of co-existence with nature and co-existence with each other, we invite you to join us in the journey of making this planet a more safe and sustainable place.
I wish the World Sustainable Development Summit a great success.
It will promote understanding of best practices in food processing in the two countries and will help in improving the food processing sector as well as improved market access, leading to equity and inclusiveness.
The MoC will lead to betterment of the food processing sector in the country by introducing innovative techniques and processes.
It will help in increasing food processing in the country by getting access to best practices and better markets
Before arriving on the stage here, I visited an exhibition of stalls set up by Self-Help Groups comprising women from all eight North Eastern States.
The artefacts and products displayed in this exhibition are indeed impressive.
Let me begin by congratulating the ladies from these Self-Help Groups, who are present here today and have just given me a glimpse of their immense talent.
The promotion of Self Help Groups has got a boost from the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana.
A large number of Self Help Groups are also benefiting through credit linkages by North Eastern Development Financial Institution with the component of interest subsidy being provided by Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region.
The Government is committed to the development of Self Help Groups, particularly Women Self Help Groups.
Keeping this in mind, in December 2015, the Union Cabinet approved a Special Package Fund for the North Eastern States.
The objective is to accelerate the implementation of the National Rural Livelihood Mission, so as to cover two-thirds of all rural households in North Eastern States by 2023-24.
Today, I unveiled a plaque for the foundation stone of a football stadium.
We are all aware of the love that the people of the North-East, and especially Meghalaya, have for Football.
Football is a passion here and is played in every nook and corner.
We are all familiar with famous football players such as Eugeneson Lyngdoh, Aibor Khongjee, and Marlangki Suting.
They have done both the country and the State proud, by representing India in International Tournaments, and their clubs in the Indian Super League.
I am told that the State Government’s Meghalaya Mission Football aims at detecting talent at the grass-root level and providing support for grooming and nurturing promising children and youngsters as professional footballers.
I am sure that the football stadium being constructed at a cost of 38 crore rupees with the support of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, will go a long way towards fulfilling this objective.
Next year, that is in 2017, India is hosting the Under-17 FIFA World Cup.
Meghalaya has a large number of football clubs and associations.
Perhaps, you can organize competitive local tournaments and lead the way for other parts of the country, to build a series of major events leading to the Under-17 World Cup.
We all know Cherrapunji, for being the place that receives the highest rainfall in the World.
Today, another feather has been added to its cap.
The Doppler Weather Radar at Cherrapunji has been dedicated to the Nation.
I congratulate the Indian Space Research Organization; Bharat Electronics Ltd.; and the Indian Meteorological Department for setting up this Radar in Cherrapunji.
The North East, a land of beauty and adventure, has been hit by several natural calamities in the recent past, on account of heavy rain and landslides.
This Weather Radar System will enable better weather forecasts, especially for the North Eastern region.
This should help in minimizing the threat posed by extreme weather conditions.
Earlier today, I had an opportunity to participate in the North Eastern Council Meeting and interact with the Governors and Chief Ministers of this region.
My Government has been proactively following the ‘Act East Policy’.
I consider the North Eastern Region as the Gateway to South-East Asia.
As part of this policy, it is our mission to upgrade the infrastructure in Road, Rail, Telecom, Power and Waterways in the region.
And today, as part of that mission, I have flagged off three new trains.
The Railway Ministry plans to spend more than Five Thousand Crore Rupees during the current year for the same.
In November, 2014, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh were brought on the rail map of India.
Recently, Agartala in Tripura has been connected with a broad gauge railway line.
Today is indeed a red letter day in the history of the North-East.
Broad Gauge Passenger Trains will now connect the States of Manipur and Mizoram.
Today, Kamakhya in Guwahati has been directly connected with Vaishno Devi in Katra, near Jammu.
We are opening up both Road and Rail routes to our neighbouring countries.
This will give a boost to the economic development of the region.
The Union Government has incorporated a special Corporation named ‘National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation’ in July 2014, for the development of Highways in the North Eastern region.
This Corporation is constructing three new bridges on Brahmaputra River.
It is implementing 34 road projects in the North Eastern Region to construct around 1,000 kilometers of roads at a total cost of over Ten Thousand Crore Rupees.
The North East Road Sector Development Scheme has been started, with an aim to connect every district in the region with a National Highway.
The development of inland waterways has been given a boost.
The Union Government has declared 19 Waterways in the North East as National Waterways.
We are committed to provide 24 by 7 electricity to all the people.
Keeping this in mind, the Union Government is making heavy investment in the power sector.
Two projects covering all the eight North Eastern States are being implemented at a cost of around Ten Thousand Crore Rupees for improving power transmission.
The commissioning of the Bishwanath-Chariyali to Agra transmission network has made available 500 Megawatts of power in the region from outside.
Out of the 18,000 unelectrified villages in the country, we have already connected more than 7000 villages with electricity.
I expect that no village in the country, including the North Eastern States, will be left without electricity by 2018.
Today one need not go through the tedious scrutiny of a banker to get small loans.
The Union Government has launched the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, under which collateral free loans are provided to small business entrepreneurs.
During 2015-16, more than three crore forty eight lakh entrepreneurs have been sanctioned loans worth more than one lakh thirty seven thousand crore rupees.
Of these, six lakh loans have been sanctioned in the North Eastern States for a value of around 2800 Crore Rupees.
Similarly, 93 Lakh bank accounts have been opened in the region under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
Around 21 Lakh people have been enrolled under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
Around 19 Lakh people have been enrolled under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana.
The Textile Sector provides employment to most people after agriculture.
Within the sector, it is the apparel segment that provides maximum employment.
A large number of women are employed in the segment.
Out of the eight centres, seven centres have already been completed, each having three units.
Meghalaya has a distinct historical, cultural and ethnic heritage.
It is blessed with natural beauty and wildlife.
There is no reason for a tourist to not want to visit Meghalaya.
There is a tremendous opportunity for tourism, as well as adventure tourism, in the North Eastern Region, particularly, Meghalaya.
We need to develop Tourist Circuits by providing better facilities to tourists, in terms of improved road connectivity, hotels, and cleanliness.
The Union Government has launched a new scheme of Swadesh Darshan, under which it is developing Tourist Circuits in the country.
One such circuit is proposed for the North East.
Less than two years ago, on 2nd October, 2014, the Union Government started its journey to create Swachh Bharat by October 2019, as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, ‘The Father of the Nation’.
In exactly one year, from 15th August, 2014 to 15th August, 2015, under the Swachh Bharat – Swachh Vidyalay Programme, we have constructed four lakh seventeen thousand toilets in over two lakh schools.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is a public movement for cleanliness.
The biggest beneficiaries of this movement are the poorest of the poor.
I request all of you to actively participate in the movement and ensure an open defecation free society and clean environment.
I am happy to note that the traditions of hygiene and cleanliness in the region got a boost with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Mawlyynong village in Meghalaya, the cleanest village, and the entire state of Sikkim, including Gangtok, have become major tourist attractions.
I would like to congratulate all the winners of the run with the theme ‘North East leads the way – Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’.
I congratulate the North Eastern Council for organizing the run.
Gangtok deserves applause for being ranked the cleanest city of the North East.
Congratulations to the people of Meghalaya for hosting the North Eastern Council Plenary Meeting in Shillong.
I also express my gratitude to all of you for giving me the opportunity for a wonderful interaction.
At a function in Itanagar, he will inaugurate the Dorjee Khandu State Convention Centre.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has given its approval to move official amendments to the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2018, pursuant to the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF).
• The Bill contains a substantive banning clause which bans Deposit Takers from promoting, operating, issuing advertisements or accepting deposits in any Unregulated Deposit Scheme.
• The Bill creates three different types of offences, namely, running of Unregulated Deposit Schemes, fraudulent default in Regulated Deposit Schemes, and wrongful inducement in relation to Unregulated Deposit Schemes.

• Clear-cut time lines have been provided for attachment of property and restitution to depositors;
• “Deposit Takers” include all possible entities (including individuals) receiving or soliciting deposits, except specific entities such as those incorporated by legislation;
The worst victims of these schemes are the poor and the financially illiterate, and the operations of such schemes are often spread over many States.
A large number of such instances have been reported from the eastern part of the country.
Subsequently, the Finance Minister in the Budget Speech 2017-18 had announced that the draft bill to curtail the menace of illicit deposit schemes had been placed in the public domain and would be introduced shortly after its finalisation.
“He leaves us sad and devastated.
RIP Lance Naik Hanumanthappa.
The soldier in you remains immortal.
Proud that martyrs like you served India”, the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Malta for strengthening cooperation in the field of Tourism.

They can either use an existing Trust/ Society/ Not for Profit Company/ State Nodal Agency (SNA) or set up a new entity to implement the scheme.
More than 80% of the expenditure are met by out of pocket (OOP).
AB-NHPM will have major impact on reduction of Out Of Pocket (OOP) expenditure on ground of:
AB-NHPM will be rolled out across all States/UTs in all districts with an objective to cover all the targeted beneficiaries.
To integrate RSBY into the health system and make it a part of the comprehensive health care vision of Government of India, RSBY was transferred to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) w.e.f 01.04.2015.
The NHPS comes in the backdrop of the fact that various Central Ministries and State/UT Governments have launched health insurance/ protection schemes for their own defined set of beneficiaries.
There is a critical need to converge these schemes, so as to achieve improved efficiency, reach and coverage.

It is a part of his mission to set up 1000 Eklavya Model Residential Schools across tribal areas.
PM said “we are specially committed to the cause of overall development of tribals from Jandhan to Vandhan.
While Jandhan has helped in the financial inclusion of the poor, Vandhan is helping in bringing additional income to the poor through Minor Forest Produce.
We are setting up Vandhan Kendras for value addition to Minor Forest Produce so that the tribals get a better deal for their produce.
We have also denotified bamboo as tree so that tribals can diversify their income from bamboo and its produce”.
Recalling the sacrifices made by tribal heroes in our freedom struggle, PM said that we are preserving their memories in museums and memorials across the country.
A Working Group will be set up to further elaborate the details of cooperation and to oversee the implementation of this MoU.
“I salute the people of India for wholeheartedly participating in this ongoing Yagna against corruption, terrorism and black money.
The Government’s decision has several gains for farmers, traders, labourers, who are the economic backbone of our nation.
I always said that the Government’s measure will bring a degree of inconvenience but this short term pain will pave way for long term gains.
No longer will the progress and prosperity of rural India be curtailed by corruption and black money.
Our villages must get their due.
We also have a historic opportunity to embrace increased cashless payments and integrate latest technology in economic transactions.
My young friends, you are agents of change who will make India corruption free and ensure more cashless transactions.
Together, we must ensure #IndiaDefeatsBlackMoney.

With a flyover at Harhua and an ROB at Tarna, the road will reduce the travel time from Varanasi to the airport.
This will reduce travel time, fuel usage and pollution in the area.
The Ring Road will provide easier and more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage.
These projects will also provide increased employment opportunities, development of small and medium industries and give a boost to economic development in the area.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today announced a landmark increase in remuneration for ASHA and Anganwadi workers.
The announcement which will be effective from next month was made during a video bridge interaction with lakhs of ASHA, Anganwadi and ANM workers today.
The Prime Minister announced the doubling of routine incentives given by the Union Government to ASHA workers.
In addition, all ASHA workers and their helperswould be provided free insurance cover under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Prime Minister Suraksha Bima Yojana.
Prime Minister also announced significant increase in the honorarium given to Anganwadi workers.
Those receiving Rs. 3000 so far, would now receive Rs. 4500.
Similarly those receiving Rs. 2200, would now get Rs. 3500.
The honorarium for Anganwadi helpers has also been increased from Rs. 1500 to Rs. 2250.
Prime Minister also announced that Anganwadi workers and helpers using techniques such as Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS), would get additional incentives.
The incentives ranging from Rs. 250 to Rs. 500, would be based on performance.
The Prime Minister interacted with teams of three As – the ASHA worker, Anganwadi worker and ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife) from across the country.
He appreciated their efforts to work together, to use innovative means and technology, to improve the delivery of health and nutrition services and achieve the goal of the POSHAN Abhiyan – reduction of malnutrition in the country.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved signing of MoU between India and Bangladesh in the field of judicial sector cooperation.
It is aimed at developing, promoting and strengthening mutual cooperation between the judiciaries of the two countries.
The MoU provides for promoting mutual interaction among judges and officials at various levels of the judiciary through exchange visits, training and academic programmes.
It will also encourage mutual exchange of information on latest developments in the field of law and justice.
It will enable exchange of knowledge in infrastructure and information technology in this field.
This track is an important landmark in the development of Usha School and will provide modern facilities to the trainees.
I take this opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of our own Payyoli Express, ‘Udan Pari’ and ‘Golden Girl’ of India P.T. Usha ji for the development of this school.
P.T.Usha has been a shining light of sports in India.
Usha ji, the nation is proud of you.
What is even better is that Usha ji has continued her association with sports.
Her personal attention and focused approach have started bringing about good results and now her trainees like Miss Tintu Luka and Miss Jisna Mathew have already made their mark at the international level.
Like Usha ji, ”USHA School” is making the best use of every opportunity by utilizing simple and limited resources.
I take this opportunity to also congratulate the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs, Sports Authority of India and the CPWD for having completed this project, which suffered various hurdles resulting in delays.
But then, Better late than Never.
One of the top-most priorities of our Government is speedy implementation and completion of projects in the designated time period.
In fact, the Project was sanctioned in 2011 but the work order for the synthetic track was awarded only in 2015.
I have been informed that this track is full PUR track.
It has been designed so as to minimize the chances of injuries and is compatible with the international standards.
Sports is closely linked with the human resource development of a society.
I have always been of the view that in addition to keeping the body healthy, sports also transforms the personality, bringing about holistic development.
Indian Army always leads from the front, be it in protecting the sovereignty of our nation or helping citizens during natural disasters.
They put their lives at risk so that 125 crore Indians live peacefully,” the Prime Minister said.
Chief Justice of India, Justice T. S. Thakur,
Hon’ble Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts,
Distinguished Guests and Friends,
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I realized that the true function of a lawyer is to unite the parties involved in a dispute.
The lesson was so indelibly burnt into me that the large part of my time during the twenty years of my practice as a lawyer was occupied in bringing about private compromises of hundreds of cases.
I lost nothing thereby, not even money and certainly not my soul.”
India is today the fastest growing major economy, and one of the most attractive destinations for FDI.
Indeed, we stand out as a bright spot in the global economy.
This is the result of India’s fundamental strengths: democracy, demographic dividend and demand.
This will further boost domestic demand, create more opportunities for Indian business and drive job creation.
India is experiencing a digital revolution.
This is bridging the digital and economic divide in Indian society in general; and rural society in particular.
Innovative business models and app-based start-ups have instilled a spirit of enterprise among Indians.
Yesterday’s job seekers are becoming today’s job creators.
The legal profession is also opening up to the promises of the digital world.
And that commercial disputes will be resolved efficiently.
A robust legal framework backed by a vibrant arbitration culture is essential.
We have enacted a comprehensive Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, implemented the National Company Law Tribunals, established a statutory Monetary Policy Committee and effected a merger of the commodities and securities market.
Further, in harmony with the Bankruptcy Code, we have amended the SARFAESI and DRT Acts this year to suit the changing credit landscape and augment ease of doing business.
Common citizens as well as businesses repose immense faith in the integrity of the judicial process.
Our Government has taken various initiatives to improve the judicial infrastructure and administration.
We have enacted the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, for speedy resolution of commercial disputes.
A National Judicial Data Grid has been set up to provide data on cases pending in district courts across the country.
Steps are being taken under the e-Court Mission to computerize the entire court systems.
Our Government has been working on a strategy for convergence of existing tribunals.
This will help transform the existing complicated tribunal system into a simpler structure.
We need to simultaneously facilitate a vibrant ecosystem for alternate dispute resolution, including arbitration, mediation and conciliation.
This will provide additional comfort to investors and businesses.
More importantly, it will also ease the case-load on Indian courts.
Resolution of disputes through arbitration is not new to us.
In ancient India, there were several mechanisms for settlement of disputes between the parties.
These included the Kulani, or village council; Sreni, or corporation; and Puga, or assembly.
Likewise, commercial matters were decided by Mahajans and Chambers.
Today, corporates and financial institutions want legal experts who can help close business deals and transactions without any disputes and litigations.
If a dispute arises, corporates want to resolve them quickly through arbitration, without going to courts.
Alternative dispute resolution processes also preserve personal and business relationships that might otherwise be damaged by the adversarial process.
Thus, availability of quality arbitration mechanisms is an integral component of Ease of Doing Business, to which our Government is committed.
Creation of a vibrant ecosystem for institutional arbitration, is one of the foremost priorities of our Government.
Recently, major amendments have been made to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.
The objective is to ensure that in normal circumstances, arbitral tribunal makes its award within 12 months.
Even the appointment of the arbitrator has to be decided by the Court within a period of 60 days.
However, great opportunities pose great challenges.
These challenges include: Availability of excellent quality and globally recognized arbitrators; Observance of professional conduct, ensuring neutrality, and timely completion of proceedings; and, Cost effective arbitration proceedings.
India also has a large number of retired judges, engineers, and scientists who can function as competent arbitrators in various fields.
We also need professionally run arbitral institutions which can deliver international standards of services at reasonable costs to businesses in India.
We welcome internationally recognized institutions in this effort.
We must deliberate on ways and means to supplement the efforts of the judiciary and arbitration mechanisms.
Mediation is one such mechanism, the potential of which has not been utilized much in the country.
We need to promote India globally as an arbitration hub.
As Roscoe Pound famously remarked, “The law must be stable but it must not stand still.”
I am sure, the deliberations here shall help in further strengthening Arbitration in India and set a milestone in positioning India as a global hub for arbitration amongst international practitioners, corporate houses and the legal fraternity.
We look forward to effectively implementing your recommendations.
They discussed the shared commitment to strengthen bilateral engagement and the many opportunities in this regard.
Dr. Fayez Tarawneh also exchanged views with Prime Minister on the situation in West Asia and the scourge of terrorism that calls for a comprehensive international response.
Dr. Fayez Tarawneh conveyed the greetings of His Majesty King Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein to Prime Minister.
The two leaders agreed that as two major powers growing rapidly, bilateral relations between India and China are vital for the realization of 21st Century as ‘Asian Century’.
The two leaders also agreed to continue their close consultations on regional and international issues of mutual interest.
My deepest condolences.”
The Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented Prime Minister of Israel Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu replicas of 2 sets of relics from Kerala that are regarded as key artifacts in the long Jewish history in India.
They comprise two different sets of copper plates that are believed to have been inscribed in 9-10th century C.E.
The first set of copper plates is a cherished relic for the Cochini Jews in India.
It is regarded as a charter describing the grant of hereditary royal privileges and prerogatives by the Hindu King, Cheraman Perumal (often identified as Bhaskara Ravi Varma) to the Jewish leader Joseph Rabban.
According to traditional Jewish accounts, Joseph Rabban was later crowned as the Prince of Shingli, a place in or equated with Cranganore.
Cranganore is where Jews enjoyed religious and cultural autonomy for centuries, before they moved to Cochin and other places in Malabar.
Local Jews once placed in each coffin a handful of earth from Shingli/Cranganore that was remembered as a holy place & a “second Jerusalem”.
The replica of these plates was made possible with the cooperation of the Paradesi Synagogue in Mattancherry, Kochi.
The second set of copper plates is believed to be the earliest documentation of the history of Jewish trade with India.
These plates describe the grant of land and tax privileges by the local Hindu ruler to a church and oversight of trade in Kollam to West Asian and Indian trading associations.
Handwritten over a hundred years ago, the scroll had been dedicated to the Paradesi Synagogue in Kochi that had been built in 1568.
The Torah is enclosed on wooden staves in a wooden case adorned with silver sheets and a metal crown covered in gold sheets in floral ornament style, bearing motifs typical of lamps and decorations of south India.
I am pleased to return to a region, known to India since ancient times as Swarnabhoomi, (the land of gold).
In January, we had the unique honour of hosting ten ASEAN leaders on our Republic Day.
The ASEAN-India Summit was a testimony of our commitment to ASEAN, and to our Act East policy.
For thousands of years, Indians have turned to the East.
Not just to see the Sun rise, but also to pray for its light to spread over the entire world.
Because, this new age of promise is also caught in shifting plates of global politics and the fault lines of history.
Free and fearless in their choices.
It was cast in peace and friendship, religion and culture, art and commerce, language and literature.
These human links have lasted, even as the tides of politics and trade saw their ebb and flow.
Over the past three decades, we have re-claimed that heritage to restore our role and relationships in the region.
For India, no region now receives as much attention as this.
And, for good reasons.
Oceans had an important place in Indian thinking since pre-Vedic times.
Thousands of years ago, the Indus Valley Civilisation as well as Indian peninsula had maritime trade.
Oceans and Varuna – the Lord of all Waters – find a prominent place in the world’s oldest books- the Vedas.
Even today there are remains of a dock.
No wonder Gujaratis are enterprising and travel widely even today!
The Indian Ocean has shaped much of India’s history.
It now holds the key to our future.
The ocean carries 90% of India’s trade and our energy sources.
It is also the life line of global commerce.
The Indian Ocean connects regions of diverse cultures and different levels of peace and prosperity.
It also now bears ships of major powers.
Both raise concerns of stability and contest.
To the East, the Malacca Strait and South China Sea connect India to the Pacific and to most of our major partners – ASEAN, Japan, Republic of Korea, China and the Americas.
Our trade in the region is growing rapidly.
And, a significant part of our overseas investments flow in this direction.
ASEAN alone accounts for over 20%.
Our interests in the region are vast, and our engagement is deep.
In the Indian Ocean region, our relationships are becoming stronger.
We are also helping build economic capabilities and improve maritime security for our friends and partners.
We promote collective security through forums like Indian Ocean Naval Symposium.
We are advancing a comprehensive agenda of regional co-operation through Indian Ocean Rim Association.
And, we also work with partners beyond the Indian Ocean Region to ensure that the global transit routes remain peaceful and free for all.
Three years ago, in Mauritius, I described our vision in one word – Sagar, which means ocean in Hindi.
South-east Asia is our neighbour by land and sea.
With each Southeast Asian country, we have growing political, economic and defence ties.
With ASEAN, from dialogue partners, we have become strategic partners over the course of 25 years.
We pursue our relations through annual summits and 30 dialogue mechanisms.
But even more through a shared vision for the region, and the comfort and familiarity of our old links.
Our ties with Japan – from economic to strategic – have been completely transformed.
It is a partnership of great substance and purpose that is a corner-stone of India’s Act East Policy.
There is a strong momentum in our cooperation with Republic of Korea.
And, there is a fresh energy in our partnerships with Australia, as also New Zealand.
With several of our partners, we meet in formats of three or more.
More than three years ago, I landed at dawn in Fiji to start a successful new phase of engagement with Pacific Island Nations.
The meetings of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation, or FIPIC, have bridged the distance of geography through shared interests and action.
Beyond East and Southeast Asia, our partnerships are strong and growing.
At the same time, India’s global strategic partnership with the United States has overcome the hesitations of history and continues to deepen across the extraordinary breadth of our relationship.
It has assumed new significance in the changing world.
And, an important pillar of this partnership is our shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific Region.
No other relationship of India has as many layers as our relations with China.
We are the world’s two most populous countries and among the fastest growing major economies.
Our cooperation is expanding.
Trade is growing.
And, we have displayed maturity and wisdom in managing issues and ensuring a peaceful border.
In April, a two-day informal Summit with President Xi helped us cement our understanding that strong and stable relations between our two nations are an important factor for global peace and progress.
I firmly believe that, Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other’s interests.
We have more trade agreements in this part of the world than in any other.
And, we are now actively participating in concluding the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.
I have just paid my first visit to Indonesia, India’s neighbour 90 nautical miles close, and not 90 nautical miles apart.
My friend President Widodo and I upgraded India-Indonesia relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
Among other shared interests, we have a common vision for maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.
They train, exercise and conduct goodwill missions across the region.
For example, with Singapore, we have the longest un-interrupted naval exercise, which is in its twenty fifth year now.
We work with partners like Vietnam to build mutual capabilities.
India conducts Malabar Exercise with the United States and Japan.
A number of regional partners join in India’s Exercise Milan in the Indian Ocean, and participate in RIMPAC in the Pacific.
We are active in the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia – in this very city.
Distinguished members of the audience, Back home, our principal mission is transforming India to a New India by 2022, when Independent India will be 75 years young.
We will sustain growth of 7.5 to 8% per year.
As our economy grows, our global and regional integration will increase.
A nation of over 800 million youth knows that their future will be secured not just by the scale of India’s economy, but also by the depth of global engagement.
More than any where else, our ties will deepen and our presence will grow in the region.
But, the future we seek to build needs a stable bedrock of peace.
And, this is far from certain.
There are shifts in global power, change in the character of global economy and daily disruption in technology.
The foundations of the global order appear shaken.
And, the future looks less certain.
For all our progress, we live on the edge of uncertainty, of unsettled questions and unresolved disputes; contests and claims; and clashing visions and competing models.
We see growing mutual insecurity and rising military expenditure; internal dislocations turning into external tensions; and new fault lines in trade and competition in the global commons.
Above all, we see assertion of power over re-course to international norms.
In the midst of all this, there are challenges that touch us all, including the un-ending threat of terrorism and extremism.
This is a world of inter-dependent fortunes and failures.
And, no nation can shape and secure it on its own.
It is a world that summons us to rise above divisions and competition to work together.
Is that possible?
I see ASEAN as an example and inspiration.
ASEAN represents the greatest level of diversity of culture, religion, language, governance and prosperity of any grouping in the world.
It was born when Southeast Asia was a frontline of global competition, a theatre of a brutal war and a region of uncertain nations.
Yet, today, ASEAN has united ten countries behind a common purpose.
ASEAN unity is essential for a stable future for this region.
And, each of us must support it, not weaken it.
I have attended four East Asia Summits.
I am convinced that ASEAN can integrate the broader region.
In many ways, ASEAN is already leading the process.
In doing so, it has laid the foundation of the Indo-Pacific Region.
The East Asia Summit and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – two important initiatives of ASEAN – embrace this geography.
It is also home to a vast array of global opportunities and challenges.
I am increasingly convinced with each passing day that the destinies of those of us who live in the region are linked.
Today, we are being called to rise above divisions and competition to work together.
The ten countries of South East Asia connect the two great oceans in both the geographical and civilizational sense.
Inclusiveness, openness and ASEAN centrality and unity, therefore, lie at the heart of the new Indo-Pacific.
India does not see the Indo-Pacific Region as a strategy or as a club of limited members.
Nor as a grouping that seeks to dominate.
And by no means do we consider it as directed against any country.
A geographical definition, as such, cannot be.
India’s vision for the Indo-Pacific Region is, therefore, a positive one.
And, it has many elements.
It stands for a free, open, inclusive region, which embraces us all in a common pursuit of progress and prosperity.
It includes all nations in this geography as also others beyond who have a stake in it.
And, ASEAN has been and will be central to its future.
And, it must equally apply to all individually as well as to the global commons.
When we all agree to live by that code, our sea lanes will be pathways to prosperity and corridors of peace.
We will also be able to come together to prevent maritime crimes, preserve marine ecology, protect against disasters and prosper from blue economy.
Indian food is among the best examples of these benefits!
But, there is growing protectionism – in goods and in services.
We will also support rule-based, open, balanced and stable trade environment in the Indo-Pacific Region, which lifts up all nations on the tide of trade and investment.
That is what we expect from Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
RCEP must be comprehensive, as the name suggests, and the principles declared.
It must have a balance among trade, investment and services.
It does more than enhance trade and prosperity.
India has been at the crossroads for centuries.
We understand the benefits of connectivity.
There are many connectivity initiatives in the region.
If these have to succeed, we must not only build infrastructure, we must also build bridges of trust.
And for that, these initiatives must be based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, consultation, good governance, transparency, viability and sustainability.
They must empower nations, not place them under impossible debt burden.
They must promote trade, not strategic competition.
On these principles, we are prepared to work with everyone.
Asia of cooperation will shape this century.
So, each nation must ask itself: Are its choices building a more united world, or forcing new divisions?
It is a responsibility that both existing and rising powers have.
Distinguished members of the audience, It is normal to have partnerships on the basis of shared values and interests.
India, too, has many in the region and beyond.
We will work with them, individually or in formats of three or more, for a stable and peaceful region.
But, our friendships are not alliances of containment.
We choose the side of principles and values, of peace and progress, not one side of a divide or the other.
Our relationships across the world speak for our position.
And, when we can work together, we will be able to meet the real challenges of our times.
We will be able to protect our planet.
We will be able to ensure non-proliferation We will be able to secure our people from terrorism and cyber threats.
In conclusion, let me say this again: India’s own engagement in the Indo-Pacific Region – from the shores of Africa to that of the Americas – will be inclusive.
That is the foundation of our civilizational ethos – of pluralism, co-existence, open-ness and dialogue.
The ideals of democracy that define us as a nation also shape the way we engage the world.
It’s easy to learn these words!
So, we will engage with the world in peace, with respect, through dialogue and absolute commitment to international law.
We will keep our economy open and our engagement transparent.
We will share our resources, markets and prosperity with our friends and partners.
We will seek a sustainable future for our planet, as through the new International Solar Alliance together with France and other partners.
This is how we wish ourselves and our partners to proceed in this vast region and beyond.
The ancient wisdom of the region is our common heritage.
Lord Buddha’s message of peace and compassion has connected us all.
Together, we have contributed much to human civilisation.
And, we have been through the devastation of war and the hope of peace.
We have seen the limits of power.
And, we have seen the fruits of cooperation.
This world is at a crossroad there are temptations of the worst lessons of history.
But, there is also a path of wisdom.
It summons us to a higher purpose: to rise above a narrow view of our interests and recognise that each of us can serve our interests better when we work together as equals in the larger good of all nations.
I am here to urge all to take that path.
Co-production of a film under this treaty will qualify it to be national production both in India and Israel.
This will also enable a common pool of creative, artistic, technical, financial and marketing resources of the two countries.
The Agreement will also help in generation of employment among artistic, technical as well as non-technical personnel.

The company will provide financial and infrastructural support to the university, and appoint Chancellor and Pro-Chancellor of the university.
In its full enrolment, it is expected to have 3000 full time students.
The funding of the new University/Institute is to entirely come from Ministry of Railways.
It will support ‘Startup India’ and ‘Skill India’ by channeling technology and delivering knowhow, and foster entrepreneurship, generating large scale employment opportunities.
This will lead to transformation of railway and transportation sector and enable faster movement of people and goods.
Through global partnerships and accessing cutting edge technologies, India will emerge as a global centre of expertise.
The university plans to use latest pedagogy and technology applications (satellite based tracking, Radio Frequency Identification and Artificial Intelligence) to improve on-the-job performance and productivity.
It will have ‘Centres of Excellence’ showcasing high-end, niche technology like High Speed Train.
Further, factors such as unprecedented growth in the transportation sector in India, increased requirement of qualified manpower and upgradation of skills and capability required to drive the transformation of Indian Railways have necessitated a world-class training hub.
The joint stamps were released on 25-01-2018.

The four-day event, beginning today is likely to be attended by several delegates, including foreign delegates from 20 countries.
Spiritual leaders, scholars, academicians and theologists from Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, UK, USA, Canada and Pakistan, among other countries, are expected to be present.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has paid his tributes to Pt.
Madan Mohan Malaviya on his Jayanti.
“Remembering Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya on his Jayanti.
His impact on India’s history is strong and unforgettable.
His efforts to further education and a spirit of patriotism will always be remembered”, the Prime Minister said.
I particularly welcome our friends from abroad and thank them for their active participation.
I thank the Government of Maharashtra for hosting this event.
I also thank other States for their active participation.
When I look back at the launch of the Make in India initiative over a year ago, I also recall the aspirations of our youth.
65 per cent of the population of India is under the age of 35.
This youthful energy is our greatest strength.
We launched the Make in India campaign to create employment and self-employment opportunities for our youth.
We are working aggressively towards making India a Global Manufacturing Hub.
We want the share of manufacturing in our GDP to go up to 25 per cent in the near future.
We were also aware that under the pressure of this campaign, the government machinery will be required to make a number of corrections on the policy front.
We are committed to make India an easy place to do business.
We want to present to the world the enormous opportunities that India offers as a base for manufacturing, design, research and development.
This is the biggest multi-sectoral event and exhibition ever held in India.
I encourage all of you to see for yourselves the direction that India is taking.
Let me take this opportunity to share my thoughts.
In a year’s time, Make in India has become the biggest brand that India has ever created.
Both within and outside the country, it has captured the imagination of people, institutions, industries, media and the political leadership.
This is because:
· It reflects our collective desire to engage in productive activities;
· It also reflects the global need to produce things at lower cost.
· It is forcing us to make corrections and increase efficiency;
· It has emboldened us to integrate with the world on equal terms.
Let me give you some concrete examples of what we have done:
Today, India is perhaps the most open country for FDI.
Most of the FDI sectors have been put on automatic approval route.
Our FDI inflows have gone up by 48 per cent since the day my Government came into office.
In fact, FDI inflow in December, 2015 was the highest ever in this country.
And I repeat this commitment once again.
We are also swiftly working towards making our tax regime transparent, stable and predictable.
We have laid all round emphasis on Ease of Doing Business.
In the manufacturing sector, we have taken decisive steps to simplify processes and rationalize provisions.
This includes licensing, cross-border trade, security and environmental clearances.
We have announced attractive schemes in several sectors including electronics and textiles.
We have made substantial policy corrections in the defence sector.
From licensing to offset regime and export regime, we have given what the defence industry was looking for.
Smooth and transparent allocation of natural resources is another example.
The advantages from this are two-fold: On one hand the production of such resources has gone up.
On the other hand, the transparent regime that we have established provides a level playing field among users and stake-holders.
This year, we will record the highest ever coal production.
Also, 2015 was the year when India’s highest ever generation of electricity was recorded.
On the issue of safety of properties and rights, we have already enacted a law for fast tracking of arbitration proceedings.
We are establishing dedicated Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions in High Courts.
The formation of the Company Law Tribunal is at the final stage.
Soon we shall be putting in place an effective IPR Policy and patent regime.
We hope to pass the bankruptcy law which has been tabled in Parliament.
Hence, on the front of policy and procedure, we have made our systems cleaner, simpler, pro-active and business friendly.
I believe in Minimum Government and Maximum Governance.
Therefore, almost on a daily basis, we are trying to remove the bottlenecks that were affecting investments and growth.
It is good to see that changes and corrections are taking place not just at the level of the Federal Government but also at the state level.
States are now in healthy competition to provide ease of business and infrastructure linkages.
The results have been encouraging.
India has become the fastest growing large economy in the world.
We will end this fiscal year with well over seven per cent growth in GDP.
IMF, World Bank, OECD, ADB and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days.
Its contribution to global growth is 68 per cent higher than its share of the world economy.
Let me also mention some other indicators:
· India has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several global agencies and institutions.
· India has jumped sixteen places on the World Economic Forum’s global competitive index.
· Moody’s has upgraded the rating of India as positive.
The momentum of the Make in India campaign has given us confidence.
It motivates us to make our policies and processes easier and friendlier.
With this background, I invite and encourage you to make India your work place; and also your home.
We are particularly keen to scale up investments in next generation infrastructure.
This includes roads, ports, railways, airports, telecom, digital networks and clean energy.
We are also investing in our social, industrial and agricultural infrastructure to give better income and quality of life to our people.
So far, it was our implementation capacity that was the biggest bottleneck.
We have speeded up processes.
The result is faster turn-around of projects.
India’s highest ever kilometers of new highway contracts awarded was in 2015.
Similarly, the increase in railway capital expenditure was the highest this year.
Thus, whether it is physical or social infrastructure; we are executing it much more efficiently than ever before.
Another bottleneck was financing.
To enhance financing, we are trying innovative ways.
We are opening up our Greenfield and Brownfield projects for Public Private Partnership.
With strong fiscal discipline, and by plugging leakages, we are trying to provide more resources for infrastructure.
We have also set up the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
We have come up with the mechanism of Tax Free Infrastructure Bonds for projects in rail, road and irrigation sectors.
We are working with a number of countries, financial markets and funds on these financial instruments.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
India is a land of immense opportunities.
Fifty of our cities are ready for setting up Metro Rail Systems.
We have to build fifty million houses.
We have also decided to do this in a cleaner and greener way.
That is why, we have made a commitment to the world community at the recent COP-21 meeting in Paris.
Hence, we are going for renewable energy in a big way – 175 Gigawatts.
I lay great stress on zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
We place high emphasis on energy efficiency, water re-cycling, waste to energy, clean India and river cleaning.
These initiatives are directed at improving quality of life in cities and villages.
These initiatives provide you additional avenues for investment in technologies, services and human resources.
To this, we have added the fourth D that is Deregulation.
Today’s India is this four dimensional India.
Our judicial systems are independent and time tested.
You will not find all these elements in any other country.
With these strengths, India offers you a solid platform to test and launch your making and designing capabilities.
In addition, our maritime location makes it easy to market products in several other continents.
We are trying to further enable and harness this vast potential with path-breaking initiatives.
Campaigns like Digital India and Skill India have been designed to prepare people to take part in this process.
We have launched financing schemes which are dedicated to promote entrepreneurship.
We are giving loans through MUDRA Bank without any collateral.
I have also impressed upon the Banks to particularly finance young entrepreneurs belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes as well as women entrepreneurs.
· Only this will realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi who wanted industries to be run in Villages and Cottages.
· Only this will realize the dreams of Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar who advocated the need to move surplus labour from agriculture to other occupations.
We are soon going to strengthen this process further under the banner of Stand-up India.
I feel that today, our domestic industry and investors are feeling much more confident and optimistic in spite of an uncertain global situation.
When we started the Make in India campaign, manufacturing growth in the country was 1.7 per cent.
This year it has improved substantially.
In the current quarter, manufacturing growth is expected be around 12.6 per cent.
· The total number of investment proposals during the last eight months is higher by 27 per cent.
· We have recorded the highest ever production of motor vehicles in 2015.
· As many as fifty new mobile phone factories were set up in the country during past ten months.
· Electronic manufacturing has grown six-fold to 18 million.
Similarly, on the trade front:
· India’s highest ever software exports were recorded in 2015.
· Also in 2015, our major ports handled the highest ever quantity of cargo.
These are very good signs.
I would like to give our industry some friendly advice.
There are immense opportunities in India.
You should take advantage of the renewed interest of Global Players to work in India.
Many of them are looking for technological and financial collaborations with Indian partners.
This includes high-tech sectors and high-value areas like defence production.
I assure you that if you take one step; we will walk two steps for you.
In a competitive world improving managerial and technological capacity is essential for survival and growth.
From space shuttles to pollution control; from health to education; from agriculture to services; our young entrepreneurs and start-ups are showing us newer and faster ways for enterprise and delivery.
My Government is committed to support them and tap their energy fully.
We want our youth to become job creators rather than job seekers.
That is why, we have launched the Start up India Campaign.
I have heard several global companies talk about their localization plans.
Thus, this campaign has the capacity to boost the Indian economy and also brighten the global scenario.
I have been saying that this century is Asia’s century.
My advice to you is to Make India your center; if you want this century to be your century.

The construction phase of the SPRs at Chandikhol and Padur is likely to generate significant direct & indirect employment opportunities in the states of Odisha and Karnataka.
My friend President Macri and all the distinguished guests from Argentina,
Greetings, (Namaskar)
I warmly welcome Mr. President, his family and the delegation.
It is a matter of great pleasure that two months after our meeting in Buenos Aires, I have this opportunity to welcome you today in India.
On this occasion, I once again congratulate President Macri and his team for the efficient and successful hosting of the G-20 Summit in 2018.
The leadership of President Macri was important for the successful hosting of the Summit.
During the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires President Macri made the pleasant announcement that during the 75th year of India’s independence in 2022 India will be hosting the G20 Summit.
For this I am thankful to him.
My fifth meeting with President Macri today reflects the fast and growing importance of bilateral engagement between the two countries.
We have proved that the distance of 15,000 kilometers between the two countries is just a number.
But the mutual relations of our people is older than this.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had traveled to Argentina in 1924.
The immense effect of that journey has become immortal through his creations.
Considering our shared values and our interests to promote peace, stability, economic progress and prosperity both the countries have given their relations the status of a strategic partnership.
I and President Macri agree that terrorism is a very serious threat to global peace and stability.
The brutal terrorist attack in Pulwama shows that the time for discussions is over now.
Now the whole world unitedly needs to take concrete steps against terrorism and its supporters.
Hesitating to act against terrorists and their anti-humanitarian supporters is also equivalent to promoting terrorism.
As the G-20 countries, it is also important that we implement the 11-point agenda of ‘Hamburg Leaders’ Statement’ on countering terrorism.
In this regard it is important that, we, both the countries are issuing a special declaration against terrorism after our discussions today.
Our cooperation in the field of space and peaceful use of nuclear energy is continuously increasing.
The Memorandum of Understanding signed today in respect of Defense Cooperation will give a new dimension to our cooperation in the defense sector.
India and Argentina are complementary to each other in many ways.
It is our endeavor to take full advantage of this for our mutual benefit.
Argentina is the powerhouse of agriculture.
India sees it as an important partner for its food security.
The work-plan of Agro-Industrial Cooperation between us today is an important step in this direction.
India’s success in the ICT field, especially JAM i.e. Jandhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity and digital payment infrastructure, we are ready to share with Argentina.
We have set a goal in India that by 2030 at least 30% of our vehicles will run with electrical batteries.
Our joint venture ‘KABIL’ has started discussions with Argentina for cooperation in the mining sector.
There are possibilities for significant increase in many sectors such as agriculture, metals and minerals, oils and gas, pharmaceutical, chemicals, motor vehicles and services.
Today we have identified specific methods to enhance our commercial engagement.
I am glad that representatives from many important Argentine companies have come with President Macri.
I am confident that his talks with business leaders in Delhi and Mumbai will be useful.
India was the first country to sign a Preferential Trade Agreement with MERCOSUR in 2004.
During the present Presidency of Argentina, today we discussed several measures for the expansion of the India-MERCOSUR trade.
There are millions of fans of Indian art, culture and spirituality in Argentina.
Argentina’s Tango dance and football is very popular in India.
In order to bring people closer, agreements have been made between tourism and Public Broadcasting agencies for cooperation and exchange of cultural programs.
India and Argentina have good cooperation in international forums.
For global peace and security and economic and social advancement of all people we accept the need of reformed multilateralism.
I hope that this journey is enjoyable for you and your family.

Western Railway is running suburban services on the existing busy double line between Virar-Dahanu Road which is a part of main line Mumbai –Ahmedabad / Delhi route.
Main line is already over saturated and there is no scope for supplementing suburban services on this line.
Construction of additional double line between Virar-Dahanu Road will address the demand of commuters in this region.
This will provide extension of suburban services from Churchgate to Dahanu Road.
Panvel-Karjat double line suburban corridor will cater to the significant urbanization and population growth in recent years in this area.
Airoli-Kalwa corridor will reduce congestion at Thane station and will also save time as these passengers can travel bypassing Thane.
Procurement of new coaches will enhance the quality of service and reduce congestion.
The works proposed under trespass control at 22 locations shall significantly reduce trespass and will provide safer environment for the public.
Further, if the amount committed for a Start-up in whole has not been released before a Start-up ceases to be so, the balance funding can continue thereafter.
These decisions have been taken to in the backdrop of the above concerns.
The MoU was signed on 13th March, 2018 at New Delhi.
The bilateral MoA shall encourage cooperation between India and WHO.
This will facilitate in improving the public health status of the people in India.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved an Agreement for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes on income between India and Iran.
The Agreement will stimulate flow of investment, technology and personnel from India to Iran & vice versa, and will prevent double taxation.
The Agreement will provide for exchange of information between the two Contracting Parties as per latest international standards.
It will thus improve transparency in tax matters and will help curb tax evasion and tax avoidance.
The Agreement is on similar lines as entered into by India with other countries.
The proposed Agreement also meets treaty related minimum standards under G-20 OECD Base Erosion & Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, in which India participated on an equal footing.
In so far as India is concerned, the Central Government is authorized under Section 90 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to enter into an Agreement with a foreign country or specified territory for avoidance of double taxation of income for exchange of information for the prevention of evasion or avoidance of income-tax chargeable under the Income-tax Act, 1961.

It is a great pleasure to meet President Obama in New York.
Thank you for hosting this meeting.
I deeply value your friendship and your vision and commitment for the relationship between our two countries.
We have achieved significant progress in our bilateral cooperation and international partnership.
I was in Silicon Valley over the weekend.
I experienced the strength of American innovation and enterprise that provide the foundation of American success.
California also reminds us that India and the United States are part of the dynamic Asia Pacific Region.
Amid the problems that the world faces today and the global challenges that we see ahead, our partnership is of great significance for us and our world.
We can apply innovation and technology for achieving Sustainable Development Goals, including combating climate change and conserving Nature.
President and I share an uncompromising commitment on climate change, without affecting our ability to meet the development aspirations of humanity.
We have both set ambitious national agendas.
In India, our measures include not just a plan to add 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, but a development strategy that will enable us to transition to a more sustainable energy mix.
Our extraordinary bilateral partnership in the energy sector focuses on clean and renewable energy and energy efficiency.
We should work together to advance that goal.
And, it is equally important to develop mechanisms to ensure that the affordable also become accessible to those who need it the most.
I thanked President Obama for U.S. support for India’s permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council.
I also sought U.S. support to complete the reform process within a fixed time frame.
I expressed our appreciation for continued U.S. support for India’s membership of the international export control regimes within our targeted time frame.
Our partnership addresses a broad range of strategic and security concerns.
Our defence cooperation, including defence trade and training, is expanding.
As existing terrorism threats grow and new ones emerge, we have resolved to further deepen cooperation on counter terrorism and radicalism.
We have just had a successful cyber security dialogue.
We have agreed to further strengthen our consultation and cooperation on helping the Afghan people combat terrorism and build a peaceful, stable and prosperous future of their nation.
To further increase our strategic engagement in the region, I look forward to working with the U.S. for India’s early membership of Asian Pacific Economic Community.
Our economic partnership is a key driver of our relationship.
I am very pleased with their confidence in India and value their constructive feedback and suggestions.
We will also continue to work towards a stronger bilateral framework of economic cooperation, including the Bilateral Investment Treaty and Totalisation Agreement.
This meeting and my engagements in the U.S. demonstrate the extraordinary depth and diversity of our relationship.
Our meeting today was very productive in advancing some of our immediate priorities as also our broader strategic partnership.
We, the leaders of India and Russia, in the year that marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries, note that the Indian-Russian special and privileged strategic partnership is a unique relationship of mutual trust between two great powers.
Our relationship covers all areas of cooperation, including in the spheres of political relations, security, trade and economy, military and technical field, energy, scientific, cultural and humanitarian exchanges, and foreign policy, and helps promote national interests of both countries, and contributes to the establishment of a more peaceful and just world order.
Our bilateral relations are based on deep mutual understanding and respect, similar priorities in economic and social development, as well as in foreign policy.
India-Russia relations have stood the test of time and have been immune to external influences.
Russia unwaveringly supported India in its struggle for independence and helped it to achieve self-sufficiency.
In August 1971, our countries signed the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation, which outlined fundamental principles of mutual relations such as respect for each other’s sovereignty and interests, good neighborliness and peaceful co-existence.
This partnership was further elevated to the level of a Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership on 21 December 2010.
Advancing the comprehensive development of the Indian-Russian relations is an absolute priority of the foreign policy of both States.
We will continue to widen our scope of cooperation by launching large-scale initiatives in different spheres and enhance and enrich our bilateral agenda so as to make it more result-oriented.
The economies of India and Russia complement each other in the energy sector.
We will strive to build an “Energy Bridge” between our States and expand bilateral relations in all areas of energy cooperation, including nuclear, hydrocarbon, hydel and renewable energy sources and in improving energy efficiency.
With concerted efforts on both sides, there has been a series of steady and demonstrable achievements in our civil nuclear partnership, including advancing nuclear power projects at the Kudankulam site and transforming it into one of India’s largest energy hubs.
We welcome the conclusion of the General Framework Agreement and Credit Protocol for Units 5 and 6 of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant.
We will work towards the implementation of the Strategic Vision for Strengthening Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy signed between the two countries on December 11, 2014.
The future of Indian-Russian cooperation holds great promise across a wide spectrum covering nuclear power, nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear science and technology.
The growing partnership in the nuclear power sector between India and Russia has opened opportunities for developing advanced nuclear manufacturing capabilities in India in line with Government of India’s “Make in India” initiative.
India and Russia commit themselves to earnestly implement the “Programme of Action for Localization in India” signed on 24 December 2015, and to encourage their nuclear industries to engage closely and foster concrete collaborations.
We are interested in launching joint projects on exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in the Arctic shelf of the Russian Federation.
We will develop joint strategies to harness the potential for mutually beneficial cooperation in the field of deep sea exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources, polymetallic nodules, and other marine resources utilizing strengths in the field of maritime research and training to develop mutually beneficial cooperation.

In this regard, we will enhance collaboration to democratize the system of international relations based on the principles of the rule of law and the central role of the United Nations coordination of world politics.
We believe that there is a need to reform the United Nations and in particular, the United Nations Security Council to make it more representative of contemporary realities and to respond more effectively to emerging challenges and threats.
We will support the advancement of a positive unifying global agenda, effectively engage in international efforts to strengthen peace and ensure global and regional stability and security, confront challenges and threats, and actively promote just and coordinated approaches to crisis resolution.

In particular, we do not accept the unilateral use of political and economic sanctions as a means of exerting pressure.
We will continue to develop cooperation within other multilateral forums and organizations, including the WTO, G20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as well as Russia-India-China cooperation.
India’s full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will considerably enhance the Organization’s capabilities to ensure peace and stability, achieve economic development and prosperity in Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as improve the Organization’s international standing.
In this context, Russia welcomes India’s applications for the membership in Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement and reiterates its strong support for India’s earliest admission to these export control regimes.
We strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and stress that there can be no justification whatsoever for any acts of terrorism, whether based upon ideological, religious, political, racial, ethnic or any other reasons.
Together, we will continue efforts to combat international terrorism, which poses a great threat to maintenance of peace and security.
We are convinced that the unprecedented spread of this threat requires decisive collective response on part of the entire global community, without double standards and selectivity, in accordance with international law and the UN Charter.
We urge all countries and entities to work sincerely to disrupt terrorist networks and their financing, and stop cross-border movement of terrorists.
We call for early conclusion of negotiations on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism to strengthen the global counter-terrorism normative and legal framework to combat this scourge.

Sisters and brothers of Kerala,
I feel blessed to be visiting God’s own country.
In Kollam, on the banks of the Ashtamudilake, I sense recovery from the floods of last year.
But we have to work harder to rebuild Kerala.
I congratulate you for completion of this bypass, which will make life easier for the people.
Ease of living for the people is the commitment of my government.
We believe in sabkasaath, sabkavikas.
With this commitment, my government gave the final sanction to this project in January 2015.
I am happy that with contribution and co-operation of state government, we have completed the project in an effective manner.
Since May 2014, when my Government took over, we have given top priority to develop infrastructure in Kerala.
Under Bharatmala a detailed project report for Mumbai Kanyakumari Corridor is under preparation.
Many such projects are in various such stages of development.
In our country, we have often seen that infrastructure projects get stalled after announcement for various reasons.
A lot of public money is wasted due to cost and time over-runs.
We decided that this culture of wastage of public money cannot continue.
Through PRAGATI, we are accelerating projects and overcoming this problem.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I sit with all secretaries of government of India and chief secretaries of state governments and review such delayed projects.
I was surprised to see that some projects are 20 to 30 years old and are hugely delayed.
It is a crime to deprive the common man of the benefits of a project or a scheme for such a long time.
Till now, I have reviewed more than 250 projects worth about 12 lakh crore rupees under PRAGATI.
From national highways to rural roads, pace of construction has almost doubled as compared to the previous government.
When we formed government, only 56% of rural habitations were connected by a road.
Today more than 90% of rural habitations are connected by a road.
I am sure that we will definitely achieve the target of 100% soon.
As in road sector my government has given priority to railways, waterways and airways.
National waterway from Varanasi to Haldia has already started.
It will ensure a clean mode of transportation and will preserve the environment for future generations.
Regional air connectivity has also improved immensely in last four years.
The rate of doubling electrification and laying of new tracks has shown big improvement.
All this is also leading to increase in job creation.
When we construct roads and bridges, we do not only connect towns and villages.
We also connect aspirations with achievements, optimism with opportunities and hope with happiness.
My commitment is for the development of each of my countrymen.
The last man in the queue is my priority.
My government has sanctioned a new fund of 7,5 00 crore rupees for the fisheries sector.
Under Ayushman Bharat, we are providing cashless health assurance to the tune of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year, for the poor.
More than 8 lakh patients have taken benefit of this scheme so far.
The government has sanctioned more than 1,100 crores rupees till now.
I request the Government of Kerala to expedite the implementation of this scheme, so that the people of Kerala can take advantage of it.
Tourism is the hallmark of Kerala’s economic development and a principal contributor to the State’s economy.
India has been ranked at third place in the new Power Ranking in the 2018 report of the World Travel & Tourism Council.
This is a major development that augurs well for the entire tourism sector in the country.
India’s ranking in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index of the World Economic Forum moved from 65th position to 40th position.
This is a jump of 50%!In fact, India was among one of the highest growing tourist destinations in the world in 2017.
It had a growth of 14% over 2016, while the world grew at an average of 7% in the same year.
Introduction of the e-Visa has been a game changer for Indian Tourism.
This facility is now available to nationals of 166 countries worldwide.
Recognizing the tourism potential of Kerala we have sanctioned 7 projects in the State under the Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD schemes for an approximate amount of Rs. 550 crore.
Later today, I will inaugurate one such project at Sree Padmanabhaswamy
Temple in Thiruvananthapuram.I will also seek blessings from Lord Padmanabhaswamy for the welfare of people of Kerala and other parts of the country.
I also share the same feeling.
I thank people of Kollam and Kerala for their love and affection.
I pray for a developed and strong Kerala.
I congratulate Rail Minister Suresh Prabhu, on presenting a thoughtful budget for the dynamic Railways of a progressive nation.
Cleanliness and upgradation of passenger facilities and technology remains the basic Mantra of last two budgets.
Beside this, Railway projects have been defined on the basis of ‘Commissioning’, in place of ‘Completion’.
I believe this policy-transformation is a Paradigm-shift in nation’s economy.
The special arrangement of the ‘Super-fast trains’ for the poor through launch of Antodaya Express and Deen-Dyalu rail coaches , reiterate the commitment of our government to the poor.
This budget will have long-term positive impact on the national economy by effective execution, enhanced capital investment and infusion of technology along with IT, in the Railways.
Appropriate steps has been taken towards fulfilling the Government’s promise to enhance connectivity in the backward areas of the country, especially the North-East.
Beside, the chronic problem of our rail routes due to the lack of capacity, has been done away with to a large extent over the past one year.
This budget will be an important tool towards the renovation of the nation.
The best thing is that the State Governments are also enthusiastically participating in the expansion of our Railways.
A detailed road-map in this direction has also been presented.
Along with that an effort has been made to seek the co-operation of Passengers and the Railway Employees, as well.
Thank You very much.
Congratulating the award winners, Prime Minister said that their contributions to Parliament and the country would always be remembered.
He added that it is an honour to work with and learn from these outstanding parliamentarians.
Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister said that disruptions in Parliament usually affect common-man and the parliamentarians who represent them the most.
He added that the disruptions are a loss to the nation than to the government.
Prime Minister said that it is the responsibility of the parliamentarians to ensure smooth functioning of Parliament so that every parliamentarian gets a chance to speak and thereby become part of history.
The Prime Minister also performed Ganga Pujan, and visited the Swachh Kumbh Exhibition.
He visited the Akshay Vat in Prayagraj.

He said the Government is making every effort to ensure good connectivity to Prayagraj.
He said the projects dedicated today, would help both infrastructure and connectivity.
The Prime Minister said that the Government is also working to ensure a clean Ganga.
He said that the organisation of the Kumbh is not just a matter of faith, but also a matter of prestige, and every visitor to the Kumbh should be well taken care of.
He said these elements consider themselves to be above all institutions.
The August Revolution was an important milestone in the freedom movement and Balia district had played an important role in that event.
Balia had been at the forefront in the freedom struggle right from the war of independence of 1857 to sounding the bugle of August Revolution to sacrificing lives.
Whether it was Mangal Pandey Ji or Chittu Pandey Ji or be it the tradition of Chandra ShekharJi, and HarivanshJi is also in that series.
And he has also been working as a trustee in the trust that was formed for implementing the dreams of Jay Prakash Ji.
HarivanshJi belongs that tradition of Wordsmiths who have built a special recognition for themselves.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that he had been a student in Banaras.
He obtained education in Banaras.
And he completed his M.A. in economics from Banaras only.
And he was selected in the Reserve Bank.
However, he did not opt for the Reserve Bank.
But later he joined a nationalized bank because of the situation of his household.
You would be pleased to know that he worked in Hyderabad for two important years of his life.
At times he had been to several places like Mumbai, Hyderabad and Delhi.
However, he was never influenced by those glittering mega cities.
He went to Calcutta to work in Ravivar newspaper.
He worked with SP Singh.
And as a trainee journalist he had worked with DharamvirBharati.
He had started his life from there.
He worked with DharmYug with a sense of attachment.
He was a confidant of Chandra ShekharJi and every person has unique traits about the dignity and values of the office he holds.
He had all the information because of the kind of office he was holding in Chandra ShekharJi’steam.
He had advance information that Chandra ShekharJi was about to tender his resignation.
He himself was associated with a newspaper.
He was attached to the world of journalism.
However, he never let his own newspaper get an idea of it that Chandra ShekharJi was about to resign.
While maintaining the dignity of his office he kept that secret to himself.
He did not allow the news to be published in his own newspaper so that the newspaper can win praise.
HarivanshJi joined Ravivar newspaper in Bihar.
It was not for those in power.
And I believe thatthe biggest factor behind the election of HarivanshJi would be that he was associated with the journalism oriented towards the cause of the society and he stayed away from the journalism oriented towards ruling class.
He had been running the newspaper as a public movement.
When Param Veer gallantry award winner Albert Ekka attained martyrdom for the country then a news was published in a newspaper that his wife was leading a life of penury and deprivation.
It was twenty years ago.
HarivanshJi took the responsibility.
He collected money from people.
He collected four lakh rupees and gave it the widow of the martyr.
Once,Naxals had kidnapped a respected person.
HarivanshJi, whatever sources he had through his newspaper, on the basis of those sources, he courageously went to the Naxal area.
He reasoned with them and secured the release of the person.
So he is a personality who is well read and who has also written a lot of books.
And I believe that it would have been easier to run a newspaper and supervise journalists.
It’s a different experience when one is oriented toward the cause of the society and social work.
And the experience with the ruling class is different.
You have shown the example of a successful tenure as a member of parliament to everyone.
Therefore, it is a huge task, it is a challenging task to compel everyone to play by the rules.
However, HarivanshJi will certainly be able to do this thing.
HarivanshJi’s wife Shrimati Asha Ji, she is from Champaran.
So in a way the entire family is connected to JP, connected to Gandhi Ji in some way or the other.
And she herself is a M.A. in political science so heracademic knowledge will be now more helpful to you.
I am confident that now this thing will become a mantra in the house that all of us members of the parliament will have the grace of God (Hari).
Now everyone will be banking on Hari (HarivanshJi).
And I am confident that all of us, be from this side or that side, all the MPs will have your support.
It was such an election in whichthere were candidates with ‘Hari’ name on either side.
One candidate has a prefix of BK before his name: BK Hari.
He has no such prefix or suffix of BK or VK.
However, I would also like to congratulate BK Hari Prasad Ji for fulfilling his responsibility for the dignity of democracy.
And everyone was saying this thing that they knew the result but decided to participate in the process.
And I would like to thank all the dignitaries, all the honorable members for taking forward this entire process in a very good manner and also to the deputy chairman.
I know that he has gotten a huge opportunity to realise his dreams and also the training that all of us MPs will receive from him.
And DashrathManjhi, today, who has been discussed about a lot in India, very few people would be aware that if there was someone who had for the first time searched and published the story of DashrathManjhi then it was HarivanshBabu.
So today we are going to be guided by the gentleman manwho has always been attached to the people at the bottom of the society.
I heartily congratulate him and convey my best wishes.

Hello, my young friends.
I see you are having a good time.
Back in 2014, I had enjoyed attending the Global Citizen Festival in the beautiful Central Park of New York.
However, this time around, my schedule did not permit me to come in person.
I look forward to your feedback and suggestions in the future as well.
I always look forward to being among young people.
It refreshes and re-energizes me.
You bring an Energy and Idealism that is unparalleled.
I can feel it now, even when I am hundreds of kilometres away from you.
This is a welcome break from my usual routine of old files and cold Delhi.
To make public policy Cool, is no mean task!
Thank you guys for having me over.
You have been smart in asking me to only address the gathering, and not sing.
Else, I am pretty sure your audience would be asking you for their money back.
And that too in 100 rupee notes.
My dear young friends, on the whole, I am convinced that we can, and we will build a Swachh Bharat, free of all forms of filth within one generation.
I also know that we will surely do so, the moment You decide to do so.
Artists have often inspired a generation.
I have had my own set of idols.
So to quote from one of Dylan’s transformative anthems which holds as much meaning today as it did when it was first sung in the 1960s.
Come mothers and fathers Through-out the land.
And don’t criticize What you can’t understand.
Please get out of the new one If you can’t lend your hand For the times they are a-changing.
Elders must learn from these words of wisdom.
We better get out of the way, as indeed, the times they are a changing.
India is a Young Nation.
And our Future is built on the Choices YOU Make, and the Actions YOU Take.
Hence, I hope YOU too will seize the moment and be the winds of change that are transforming our nation.
Because, as Chris has said in his songs.
You can see the change you want to
Be what you want to be
Everything you want is a dream away
Under this pressure under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape.

I will address a public meeting in Udaipur.
I will also visit the Pratap Gaurav Kendra and pay my respects to the great Maharana Pratap”, the Prime Minister tweeted.
The Mission was launched in September, 2014.
The NAM is being implemented by Ministry of AYUSH with the objectives of providing cost effective AYUSH Services, with a universal access which involve, among other things –
• upgradation of AYUSH Hospitals and Dispensaries,

Under NAM special focus is given for specific needs of such areas and for allocation of higher resources in their Annual Plans.
The expected outcomes of the Mission are as follows:
i. Better access to AYUSH healthcare services through increased number of healthcare facilities offering AYUSH services and better availability of medicines and trained manpower.

I am delighted to return to Afghanistan; Honoured to be among people who have set the standard of courage for our age; Privileged to see again the high tide of friendship in this vast ocean of love for India.
This is yet another giant step in Afghanistan’s march to progress.
And, it is a historic moment of emotion and pride in the relations between Afghanistan and India.
Thank you, Mr. President, for your invitation and for naming this dam as Afghanistan-India Friendship Dam.
We are truly humbled by the generosity of the Afghan spirit.
Rivers have been bearers of great civilisations of the world.
In the flow of rivers runs the course of human progress.
In the Holy Quran, river is central to the image of Paradise.
The dam is a generator not just of electricity but also of optimism and belief in the future of Afghanistan.
The lost decades speak to us about the ravages of a long drawn war.
And, when a new dawn broke over Afghanistan in 2001, we resumed the project.
They will not come in the way of the dreams and aspirations of the Afghan people.
The fields that produce the finest fruits and saffron shall once again come alive with the clear waters of the river.
The homes that lived through dark nights of dread will now be lit by the power of hope.
And, another young girl poet will not have to live a life of pain, denial and longing, or see a life of promise cut short.
Today, the world will see the Harirud River as an abiding emblem of our commitment to a shared future of progress.
And, the Friendship Dam unites us in solidarity as Chishti Sharif joined us in spirit centuries ago.
For, it is from here that the Chishti Silsila or Chishti tradition of Sufism came to India.
Its glorious tradition and teachings resonate through the dargahs of Ajmer, Delhi and Fatehpur Sikri.
It draws people from all faiths with its message of love, peace, compassion; of harmony among people of all beliefs; of respect for all of God’s creations; and service to humanity.
And, it is on the foundation of these values that Afghans and Indians seek each other, not because they harbour designs against another.
Khwaja Moiunuddin Chishti, the first of the Chishti saints in India, said that human beings must have the affection of the sun, the generosity of the river and the hospitality of the earth.
In your clear eyes, I saw the deep well of affection for India.
In your smiles, I saw the joy of this relationship.
In the firmness of your embrace, I felt the trust in our friendship.
Today, I return with the gratitude and admiration of 1.25 billion people.
It has empowered women with skills and the youth with the education to shoulder the responsibility for Afghanistan’s future.
We have joined hands to build roads that bridge the distances of your country, from Zaranj to Delaram, and transmission lines that bring power to your homes.
Now, India’s investment in the port at Chahbahar in Iran will give Afghanistan a new route to the world and a new path to prosperity.
And, to implement that vision,just last month, President Ghani joined President Rouhani of Iran and me in witnessing the signing of the Chahbahar Trade and Transit Agreement between Afghanistan, Iran and India.
Our partnership will benefit every section of Afghan society.
Because across its difficult geography, and across its diversity, and beyond the identities as Pushtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras, Afghanistan must live and prosper as one.
For, divisions among Afghan people will only help those who seek to dominate the nation from outside.
As we work together, we draw strength and confidence from your deep commitment to protect our partnership from the designs of others.
When our people are under attack, the brave Afghans guard us as their own.
They put themselves in the line of fire so that their Indian friends are safe.
This is the nobility of your heart and the strength of your friendship.
I have seen this from the moment I assumed office as Prime Minister.
Mr. President, Friends,
Afghanistan’s success is a deeply held hope and desire of every Indian.
It comes from the love and admiration for Afghans in our hearts.
We want to see your art, culture and poetry thrive.
And, we want to see your cricketers join the ranks of test players and also seek glory in IPL.
But, it also comes from the recognition that when Afghanistan succeeds, the world will be safer and more beautiful.
When the values that define Afghans prevail, terrorism and extremism will be in retreat.
Because we know that extremism and terrorism cannot stop at your border or end at the boundaries of our region.
India’s capacity may be limited, but our commitment is without limits.
And, in the fields, villages and cities of Afghanistan, we will work together for that future.
And, whatever happens, in a bright or a dark moment, we will always experience, as Herat’s great Sufi Poet, Hakim Jami, would say, the freshness and happiness of the gentle breeze of friendship.
Thank you for this honour, this affection and this friendship.

It gives me great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth and his delegation to India.
We are truly honoured, Excellency, that you have chosen India for your first overseas visit after taking on the new responsibility as Prime Minister of Mauritius earlier this year.
Your visit reflects the depth of our ties that have endured and enhanced over two centuries.
And, our bonds are not limited to Governments.
They extend to our people and societies who take pride in our shared roots.
Our bonds have flourished despite time and distance.
Today, they weave a rich tapestry of friendship in diverse areas.
My discussions with Prime Minister Jugnauth have been warm and productive.
Our conversation reminded me of my own memorable visit to Mauritius in March 2015.
That visit, which was my first to the Indian Ocean region, gave us a robust agenda for cooperation.
It also underscored the commonality of our values, interests and efforts.
Today, we have taken another leap in our bilateral agenda.
As frontline states of the Indian Ocean, Prime Minister Jugnauth and I agree that it is our responsibility to ensure collective maritime security around our coasts and in our EEZs.
The conclusion of the bilateral Maritime Security Agreement today, will strengthen our mutual cooperation and capacities.
We have also agreed to further strengthen our wide-ranging cooperation in hydrography for a secure and peaceful maritime domain.
India is supporting the National Coast Guard of Mauritius in augmenting its capacity through Project Trident.
We have also taken a decision to renew the life of the Coast Guard Ship Guardian, that was provided to Mauritius, under a grant assistance programme.
A strong developmental partnership with Mauritius is a hallmark of our engagement.
India is proud to participate actively in the ongoing development activities in Mauritius.
It will also help in the implementation of priority projects.
Prime Minister Jugnauth and I welcome the progress in ongoing projects.
We are happy to further deepen our exchanges in this domain.
We applaud the leadership shown by Prime Minister Jugnauth in drawing attention to the importance of renewable energy.
The signing and ratification of the framework agreement on International Solar Alliance by Mauritius has opened up new vistas of regional partnership for both countries in this field.

We agreed to continue supporting each other in multilateral fora and cooperate closely on our common challenges and interests.
Prime Minister Jugnauth’s visit will contribute to elevating our relationship to new heights on the bed-rock of our traditional links.
I thank Prime Minister Jugnauth for his vision and support to our relationship.
And I look forward to working closely with him in the coming months as we put into action the decisions we have taken today.
Once again, I extend a warm welcome to Prime Minister Jugnauth and wish him a fruitful stay in India.
The FMBAP Scheme will be implemented throughout the country for effective flood management, erosion control and anti-sea erosion.
The proposal will benefit towns, villages, industrial establishments, communication links, agricultural fields, infrastructure etc. from floods and erosion in the country.
The catchment area treatment works will help in reduction of sediment load into rivers.
The Scheme “FMBAP” has been framed by merging the components of two continuing XII Plan schemes titled “Flood Management Programme (FMP)” and “River Management Activities and Works related to Border Areas (RMBA)”.
The aim of the Scheme is to assist the State Governments to provide reasonable degree of protection against floods in critical areas by adopting optimum combination of structural and non-structural measures and enhancing capabilities of State / Central Government officials in related fields.
The works under the scheme will protect valuable land from erosion and flooding and help in maintaining peace along the border.
The Scheme aims at completion of the on-going projects already approved under FMP.
Further, the scheme also caters to Hydro-meteorological observations and Flood Forecasting on common rivers with the neighbouring countries.
The Scheme also includes survey and investigations, preparation of DPR etc. of water resources projects on the common rivers with neighbouring countries like Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Sapta Kosi-Sun Kosi Projects in Nepal which would benefit both countries.

“I am Diksha Katiyal speaking.
Therefore I request you that you tell something to the younger generation today on this topic.”

The Prime Minister invited Korean companies to enhance their investments in India, and to “Make in India,” which would also imply “Make for India.”
He suggested that major Korean companies can plan to invest as a group in a region of India, similar to the pattern they follow in Korea.
Teachers have a central role in realising our dream of a ‘New India’ that is driven by cutting edge research and innovation.
Let us make the next 5 years about ‘teach to transform, educate to empower and learn to lead'”, the Prime Minister said.

Let me begin by expressing my deepest condolences on the loss of lives in the terrorist attack on a civilian Russian aircraft and in the unfortunate downing of the military jet in Syria.
In this moment of grief and challenge, we stand in solidarity with the people of Russia.
Mr. President, thank you for generous and warm hospitality.
You are the architect of the India-Russia strategic partnership.
And, in a changing world, your leadership has kept our relations on a steady course of progress and growth.
Mr. President, I have always had great respect and appreciation for our strategic partnership.
It has been a source of strength and success for India in defence, development and diplomacy.
And, there is genuine goodwill and mutual respect between our people.
As I look to the future, I see Russia as a significant partner in India’s economic transformation and in shaping a balanced, stable, inclusive and a multi-polar world.
We have had excellent conversations over the past two days and very productive outcomes.
It has deepened my conviction that this relationship truly meets the test of a special and privileged strategic partnership.
We have laid the foundation of the future character of this strategic partnership.
These would boost defence manufacturing in India and India’s defence readiness with next generation equipment.
The pace of our cooperation in nuclear energy is increasing.
We are making progress on our plans for twelve Russian nuclear reactors at two sites.
The agreement today will increase Indian manufacturing content in these reactors.
It supports my mission of Make in India.
I thank President Putin for his support.
With one of the world’s largest reserves of hydrocarbons, Russia can be a critical source of energy security for India, especially because of our strategic partnership.
With President Putin’s support, we are enlarging Indian investments in Russian hydrocarbon sector.
President Putin and I are moving creatively in expanding our economic relations.
Following our last Summit, India has created a special notified zone to facilitate direct trade between the world’s largest uncut diamond exporter, Russia, and India, which processes 90% of the world’s uncut diamond.
Second, we are working on logistics.
Our Green Corridor project has taken off.
The International North South Transit Corridor through Iran will significantly reduce transportation time and cost.
Third, we are moving forward on the India-Eurasian Economic Union Free Trade Agreement.
This will also benefit us in Central Asia.
The agreements and the announcements today give me confidence that we will see huge increase in investments and trade in both directions.
We have strong collaboration in the United Nations.
Our membership of BRICS, East Asia Summit, G20 and now Shanghai Cooperation Organisation gives our partnership a global character.
It is particularly important in the arc from Eurasia to Asia Pacific, including in Central Asia and Afghanistan.
We are one in our belief that the world must unite and take concerted action on combating terrorism, without distinction and discrimination between terrorist groups and target countries.
We agree that an early political settlement through dialogue in West Asia is essential for restoring stability and containing extremism in the region.
Indeed, all nations must come together, with sensitivity to each other, to address the challenges of our times.
I am very pleased to have deepened my association with President Putin.
Together, we have also given new direction and added more momentum and content to our strategic partnership.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will address the golden jubilee and foundation day celebrations of Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation, Pune, at 5 PM today via video conferencing.
“At 5 PM, I will address golden jubilee and foundation day celebrations of Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation, Pune, via video conferencing.”, the Prime Minister said in a tweet from his account.
I congratulate every department associated with the construction of this centre.
I sincerely hope that this Centre will prove to be a great inspiration for spreading Babasaheb’s teachings.
Dr Ambedkar International Centre for socio-economic Transformation is a part of the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre.
The centre will also play a significant role for research in social and economic issues.
This centre will also be a platform for the discussion on how to focus on economic and social issues by incorporating the mantra of ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas’ also known as ‘inclusive growth’.
Friends, several great souls were born in our country from time to time, who not only became the face of social reform but also played a significant role in building the future of the country and shaping the thought process of the country.
The strength of Babasaheb is evident from the fact that over the years attempts have been made to suppress his ideas and to negate his contribution in the nation building process but no one could erase the ideas of Babasaheb from the minds of the Indians.
I won’t be wrong to say that the people today are more influenced by the ideas of Babasaheb than the family which was behind the conspiracy.
We are indebted to Babasaheb for his contribution to the nation building.
Our government is making efforts to spread the ideas of Babasaheb to more and more people, especially to the younger generation so that they can study them.
Therefore this government is trying to develop those places that are associated with the life of Babasaheb as pilgrimage centres.
Dr Ambedkar National Memorial is being built in the house where Babasaheb had died in Delhi’s Alipur.
Similarly, the birthplace of Babasaheb which is Mhou of Madhya Pradesh is being developed as a pilgrimage centre.
The London residence of Babasaheb is being transformed into a memorial by the BJP government of Maharashtra after its purchase.
Similarly, Ambedkar Memorial is being built on the land of Indu mill in Mumbai.
Deekshabhoomi is also being developed in Nagpur.
The ‘Panchteerth’ or the five pilgrimage centres are in a way tribute to Baba Saheb on behalf of today’s generation.
By the way, a sixth pilgrimage Centre has also been developed in the virtual world last year.
This pilgrimage Centre is empowering the country and providing impetus to it digitally.
Bharat Interface for Money i.e. the BHIM app that was launched last year was a tribute to Babasaheb’s financial vision by this government.
Far from the despair he had dreamt of an India that will be free from all the evils and will be inclusive of all.
I know today we are divided politically, socially, and economically.
But I am quite convinced that given time and circumstance nothing in the world will be able to prevent this country from becoming united.
With all our castes and creeds I have not the slightest hesitation that we shall in some form be a united people.
The type of conduct suggests that we have that capability of moving towards the path of unity by moving together with all the components.”
All these words belong to Babasaheb Ambedkar.
There is no strain of disappointment!
The person who had been the victim of social evils of the country was full of expectations.
Some people give more importance to the caste in which they have taken birth than the land on which they have taken birth.
I believe that today’s new generation is capable of eliminating these social evils.
Mainly the changes that have taken place in the past 15 to 20 years are only due to the efforts of the new generation.
They understand that the country is being divided on the basis of caste and the country cannot progress at the desired pace with these divisions.
So I have an unwavering trust in the youth whenever I talk about freeing the ‘New India’ from the bondage of caste system.
We also have to make our political democracy a social democracy.
Political democracy cannot survive without a base of social democracy.”
The social democracy was the Mantra of freedom and equality for every Indian.
This equality is not only in terms of the rights, but also of the way of living.
But even after so many years of independence there is no equality in the lives of millions of people.
Even the basic amenities such as electricity connection, water connection, a small house, Life Insurance are far from accessible.
If you closely look at our government’s way of working and our work culture for the past 3 to 3 and a half years, you will notice that we have been trying to fulfil that dream of Babasaheb’s social democracy.
The schemes and the policies of this government focus upon strengthening the social democracy.
If we look at the Jan Dhan Yojana we will see that it has provided the right of connecting with the banking system to millions of poor people of the country.
They have been elevated to that class of people that have bank accounts and debit cards.
The government has helped to open bank accounts of more than 30 crore poor people under the scheme.
RuPay debit cards have been provided to more than 23 crore people.
Now even the poor have achieved some kind of equality as they can also queue up at the ATMs to withdraw money with their RuPay debit cards.
Earlier he used to be scared of this queue and could never imagine of queuing up outside the ATMs.
How many of you get the opportunity to visit your village after every 4 or 5 months?
I request those who have not been to their villages for a long time to now visit their village and see.
Go and ask someone from your village about the Ujjwala scheme.
This is a major example of how the government has eliminated the social discrimination.
Now even the poor households cook their food on gas ovens.
Now the poor woman does not have to spend her life in the smoke of the firewood.
This is one difference which can be easily understood by the people who are more connected to their villages.
When you go to your village you will also feel the influence of another scheme.
The Swachh Bharat Mission has created equality among the women in the villages.
The presence of toilets in some houses and the absence of the same in the others used to create a division.
This used to create a threat to the health as well as safety of the women in the villages.
The level of sanitation has increased to more than 70% in the villages whereas it used to be 40% before.
The government has also come up with insurance plans to strengthen social democracy.
So far 18 crore poor people of the country have joined the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana and Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
You will be surprised to know that under the schemes, a sum of rupees 1800 crores approximately has been given to the poor.
Just imagine today the poor in the rural areas are living a tension-free life.
He always hoped that the governments in India would follow the Constitution without discriminating against different castes.
Today, in every scheme of this government you will see a glimpse of the efforts to give equal rights to all without discrimination.
Just recently the government has launched another scheme – ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Har Ghar Bijli Yojana or Saubhagya scheme’.
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is another such scheme that aims at removing the inequality.
Even today there are millions of people in the country who do not have their own house.
It is important to have a house first, be it a small or a big one.
Therefore the government aims at providing every poor of the village and the city with his own house by the year 2022.
For this, the government is providing financial assistance.
The lower income class and the middle income class are getting interest subsidy on loans.
Brothers and sisters, these programmes are moving at their determined speed and will be completed before their scheduled time.
Today this Dr Ambedkar International Centre is a living example of the fact that this government’s schemes do not get stuck midway.
This government has utilised its full strength in order to fulfil the set goals.
This is our work culture.
We not only just synchronise our goals with the plans but also finish them on time.
This is not just from now but the direction was fixed within the first few months of our governance.
You might remember, I had said from the ramparts of the Red Fort in 2014 that within one year all the government schools in the country will have a separate toilet for the daughters.
We have built more than 4 Lakh toilets in schools within a year.
The girls used to dropout of schools due to lack of toilets in the schools.
Under the scheme, the government has planned to connect more than 580 Mandis in the country online.
So far more than 470 agricultural markets have been added online.
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which I mentioned earlier, was launched on 1st May last year.
The government has set a target of providing gas connections to 5 crore poor women by 2019.
In just 19 months, the government has given free gas connections to more than 3 crore 12 lakh women.
Brothers and sisters, this is our way of working.
The government is working on the same vision of Babasaheb of providing equal rights to the poor.
The government considers delays in the schemes as a criminal negligence.
Now if we consider this Centre, the decision of making it was taken in the year 1992.
But nothing happened for 23 years.
After coming to power this government had laid the foundation-stone of this centre and the same government has inaugurated it.
The political parties who ask for votes in the name of Babasaheb will probably not even be aware of this.
Since all the schemes have come on track and the plans have gained momentum we are thinking of reducing the deadline so that the work gets completed as early as possible.
Recently we have reduced the deadline for ‘Indradhanush Mission’ by 2 years.
Under the Indradhanush Mission the government is holding vaccination campaigns in those areas which were not covered under the on-going vaccination campaigns.
Lakhs of children and pregnant women were left out of vaccination.
But under this campaign, more than 2.5 crore children and more than 70 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated.
Earlier, the goal of the government was to achieve full immunization by the year 2020 but now it has been reduced to the year 2018.
The ‘Intensified Mission Indradhanush’ has been launched along with ‘Mission Indradhanush’ in order to achieve this goal.
Now the government is working at a very fast pace to connect hundred per cent villages to road network.
The government’s emphasize is on encouraging Dalit and backward brothers and sisters living in far-flung areas of the country for self-employment.
So, when we started the Stand-up India programme, we decided that every Bank branch should provide loans to at least one Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe through this scheme.
Under the scheme loans of nearly 9.75 crore rupees have been sanctioned so far and loans of over 4 lakh crore rupees without a bank guarantee has been provided to the people.
The new India that I am talking about is also the dream of Babasaheb – the India with equal opportunity and equal rights for all, the India free from the bondage of caste system, the India progressing with the power of Technology and the India following the concept of inclusive development- Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas.
Come; let us take a pledge to fulfil Babasaheb’s dreams.
May Baba Saheb give us the strength to fulfil these resolutions by the year 2022.
I would like to end my speech with this desire.
The Prime Minister also wished the President and Russian people on the occasion of Christmas, which is being celebrated in Russia today.
Recalling successful wide-ranging discussions, inter alia, in Sochi in May and during President Putin’s visit to New Delhi in October for the Annual Summit, the leaders agreed to maintain the momentum in the bilateral relations.
Both leaders agreed that India-Russia cooperation plays an important role in the global multilateral order.
Speaking on the occasion, he said that Swami Dayananda, continues to inspire even today.
The Prime Minister said that the Naya Sankalp – new resolve – should be to raise India’s stature globally.
He said the attempt should always be to create a modern and scientific India of the 21st century.
The Prime Minister also spoke of various Government initiatives for the benefit of the youth, such as Mudra Yojana, Start-Up India and Skill Development.
The warmth and affection that I received from the people of Jaffna is still fresh in my mind.
It was a historic day because it was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Jaffna.
Today is another landmark day.
When, once again, we celebrate our partnership with the people of Sri Lanka and with residents of Jaffna.
Today, along with President Sirisena, we dedicate the renovated Durraiappah Stadium to the people of Sri Lanka.
And, we are not alone.
The modern tools of communication have enabled 1.25 billion people of India and the friendly people of Sri Lanka to join us in this celebration.
After a wait of nearly 20 years, your applause and cheer will once again rekindle the soul of Durraiappah Stadium.
Even while we are sitting thousands of kilometres away in Delhi, we can feel the pulse of vibrancy and atmosphere of change in Jaffna.
The Durraiappah Stadium is not just brick and mortar.
It is a symbol of optimism and economic development.
An arena for a prosperous and healthy future for Jaffna’s youth.
It demonstrates your determination to shed the legacy of violence and pursue the path of economic progress.
Its foundations are supported by your courage and great sacrifices.
Its successful completion is a signal that you have left the past behind and are looking to the promise of a prosperous future.
I also salute your visionary leadership and of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe the Governor and the Chief Minister of the Northern Province in ensuring the success of this project.
Our relations are not limited to the confines of our two governments.
They reside in the rich contacts of our history, culture, language, art, and geography.
India strongly believes that its economic growth must drive and bring benefit to its neighbours.
Durraiappah Stadium embodies the spirit of our cooperation.
Indeed, India’s support for Sri Lanka’s development is a promise of our friendship.
And, that it will be based on your priorities and your needs is an assurance that you can rely on.
This is what makes our enduring ties relevant to our present, as also to our future.
Excellency Sirisena and Friends,
Sri Lanka was among the first supporters of the UN resolution on this subject in 2014.
And, today, we have celebrated the start of the International day of Yoga with a curtain raiser from Jaffna, from this Durraiappah Stadium.
The ‘Surya Namaskar’, performed just a short while ago, has sent the message of holistic healthcare, harmonious and sustainable living with nature to the world.
We could not have asked for a more fitting start and tribute to the International Day of Yoga.
I once again thank you; the entire leadership present on your side, and the lovely people of Jaffna for this opportunity.
Durraiappah Stadium will stand as yet another symbol of our lasting friendship.
India will walk side by side with Sri Lanka as it charts its own path to progress and prosperity for all of its citizens.
I once again convey greetings to the people of Sri Lanka from 1.25 billion people of India.
Bohoma Stuti, Mikka Nandri, Thank you very much
He spoke of the special ties between India and Indonesia, and recalled the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi earlier this year, where leaders from 10 ASEAN nations, including Indonesia, were present.
The Prime Minister said that in the last four years, India has witnessed unparalleled transformation.
In this context, he spoke of FDI, openness of the Indian economy, ease of doing business, and competitiveness of the Indian economy.
He said both countries are proud of their democratic ethos and diversity.
He gave examples such as the Bali-Jatra, and similarities in cuisine and language to highlight the close cultural links between the two countries.
He noted that earlier today, he and President Widodo had jointly inaugurated the Kite Exhibition, which included themes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
Talking about developments in India, he said that the Union Government is creating systems that are development-friendly and corruption-free.
He said that going ahead from “Ease of Doing Business,” the focus is now on “Ease of Living.”
Our processes are transparent and sensitive, he added.
He gave an account of the dramatic developments that have taken place in a number of areas of infrastructure development.
He spoke of India’s vibrant start-up ecosystem, and the International Solar Alliance.
Both India and Indonesia have a sensitive outlook when it comes to helping those in need, the Prime Minister asserted.
He said that India does not see the colour of anyone’s passport, and helps all fellow humans who require any assistance.
He said India and Indonesia do not just rhyme in their names, but share a common rhythm in their culture, traditions, and democratic values.
What, however, does offer hope is that most of these deaths can be prevented through simple yet effective and proven interventions.
This forms the key peg for this Summit.
Keeping aside the work that still needs to be done, there have been significant achievements on the global front in the area of maternal and child health.
What this translates into is this: India is likely to reach close to achieving the MDG target if the current trend of annual decline is sustained.
In addition to this remarkable achievement, another truly historic accomplishment has been the victory over Polio.
India was declared as “Polio-Free” on 27 March 2014.
This will help us achieve more than 90% coverage by 2020, which otherwise would take more than 25 years at the current pace.
The first phase has been successfully implemented.
India also responded by acting on the first “Call to Action” through its commitment and launch of RMNCH+A.
These remarkable successes in the field of maternal and child health have been possible through our National Health Mission (NHM).
The Mission, with its urban and rural health components – perhaps one of the largest public health programmes in the world – has resulted in improved health outcomes.
52% of India’s under-5 mortality is contributed to by deaths of newborns in the first month of life.
Under the NHM, our approach emphasises a continuum of newborn care both at the community and facility level.
Our focus has been to get pregnant women to have safe delivery in our institutions.
Special efforts are being made to put in more resources and focussed programmes in these areas.
I have witnessed people getting poorer because of unfortunate health episodes.
As we assemble here, we need to send a very very strong message not only to ourselves, not only to the 24 countries present here, but to the entire world.
The message is of our commitment, that we will ensure that every woman, every child who can be saved will be saved.
We also need to make a clarion call to the world to join hands in taking such steps that would ensure this.
India has done well in many ways and would be extremely happy to share its experience with other countries.
Last year, I had made a commitment of assisting the SAARC countries in keeping it Polio free.
We have also made a commitment to provide Pentavalent vaccines to such SAARC countries as would need it.
We will offer whatever experience we have to the world community.
India would be happy to assist any country with technology, system strengthening and programme implementation capsules.
We could train personnel and skill them for better management of child sickness in our Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs) as well as share our experience at home based new born care.
India’s rich experience in Universal immunization and particularly its experience this year with the Mission Indradhanush could be shared with all the countries.
This will be apart from our offer of support for Polio eradication.
I again warmly welcome you all to this important international Summit.
The creation of the new cadre and change in structure will not only strengthen the organization but will also help to achieve the vision of “Startup India”, “Stand-up India” and “Make in India”.
The measure will enhance the capacity and efficiency of the organization and also help in achieving growth in MSME sector through a focussed and dedicated cadre of technical officers.

Over 44,000 villages have been connected in the period from 2014 to 2018, as compared to about 35,000 in the preceding four year period.
Green technologies, and non-conventional materials such as waste plastic and fly ash, are being used in rural road construction.
In the railways sector, there has been significant addition in capacity and rolling stock.
This has boosted employment in the housing sector and related construction industries.
According to an independent study, the average construction completion time has dropped sharply, from 314 days in 2015-16, to 114 days in 2017-18.
Stress is also being given to disaster resilience, and low cost housing design typologies.
In urban housing, emphasis is being laid on new construction technologies.
54 lakh houses have been sanctioned under Pradhan MantriAwaas Yojana (Urban), since the inception of the scheme.
It has been decided to grant a Mission status to the Authority with corresponding powers under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to take cognizance of the provision of the said Act and follow up thereon.

The dedication ceremony shall also be punctuated by flypast of IAF aircraft, and performances of cultural troupes.
I urge all parties to reject the motion that has been moved in the House
Today the nation has seen the negativity expressed by some members.
India saw how some people are so deeply opposed to development:
If you were not prepared for the debate why did you bring the motion?
Why were you trying to delay the motion
The only thing they have to say- remove Modi
What we saw among members of the Opposition was sheer arrogance.
Let me tell this member it is the people who elected us.
That is how we have come here:
What is his hurry to come to power?
To remove one Modi, see who all they are trying to bring together:
We are not here for selfish interests:
We are here because we have the blessings of 125 crore Indians.
Toilets have been constructed across India at a record pace:
Women are leading a smoke-free life due to Ujjwala Yojana.
Our Government has opened bank accounts for the poor.
Earlier, the doors of the banks never opened for the poor.
It is this Government that is bringing a programme like Ayushman Bharat that will give top quality healthcare to the poor: PM
The decision of neem-coated urea has helped the farmers of India:
The Indian economy is being strengthened and India is also strengthening the global economy
The fight against Black Money is going to continue.
They have confidence in nothing
What have we come to?
Everything does not merit a childish conduct:
One of the leaders spoke about Doklam.
The same leader, who believed the Chinese Ambassador over our forces.
Due to one careless allegation in the House on Rafale, both nations had to release statements:
My appeal to the Congress is please do not bring politics in national security:
I will not tolerate this insult to our armed forces
You can abuse me as much as you want.
Stop insulting the Jawans of India.

I want to tell the people of Andhra Pradesh that we will keep working for them.
We will do everything possible for the development of AP:
A phone call would get loans for their cronies and the nation suffered
I want to tell you about the NPA problem.
This Government stands with the Muslim women in their quest for justice
Any instance of violence brings shame to the nation.
I will once again urge the state governments to punish those who indulge in violence

Benefits & Coverage:
More than 10 crore people will be benefitted by this programme.
Financial Outlay:
An amount of Rs. 9046.17 crore will be expended for three years commencing from 2017-18.

NNM targets to reduce stunting, under-nutrition, anemia (among young children, women and adolescent girls) and reduce low birth weight by 2%, 2%, 3% and 2% per annum respectively.
Inspite of these, level of malnutrition and related problems in the country is high.
There is no dearth of schemes but lack of creating synergy and linking the schemes with each other to achieve common goal.
NNM through robust convergence mechanism and other components would strive to create the synergy.
The Prime Minister will later visit Mumbai.
He will pay respects to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar at Chaitya Bhoomi, and unveil a plaque to mark the laying of the Foundation Stone of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial at the Indu Mills Compound.

Rameshwaram is the land which has shown the way to the spiritual life of the country as a light house for thousands of years.
And in this century Rameshwaram will also be known for one more reason – for providing this country a diligent scientist, a motivational teacher, an intelligent thinker and a great President in the form of Abdul Kalam ji.
It is a great honour for me to touch this sacred soil of Rameswaram.
As home to one of 12 Jyotirlings of our country Rameswaram is not only a religious center.
Rameswaram is also a center of deep spiritual knowledge a ज्ञान पुंज .
A place that was also visited by Swami Vivekanand on his return from the United States in 1897.
In his actions and thoughts Dr Kalam always reflected the simplicity, depth and calmness of Rameswaram.
Last year, we had made a resolution and had promised you that in the memory of Dr. Kalam, a memorial will be built in Rameshwaram.
This memorial will inspire the present and the future generations of the country.
Today I saw the monument and I feel proud that even within a span of such a short time, a grand memorial with the innovative ideas and imagination, perfectly in line with Dr. Abdul kalam’s thoughts, work, life, ideal, resolution has been created.
I congratulate Venkaiah ji and his entire team, the Tamil Nadu Government, all the Departments of the Government of India and DRDO for building such a monument.
You would be surprised if any work in our country is completed on time as per our imagination.
Then the citizens are surprised that can the government do such a thing?
But this is possible because today we have a government in Delhi which is committed to accomplish the tasks assigned by the people of our country.
This government has transformed the entire work culture and has successfully encouraged a time-bound work culture.
I would like to share another secret behind the success of this monument which will make 125 Crore people of this country feel proud of.
The labourers who were engaged in this work had been working as per the government norms from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
This memorial for Abdul Kalam ji in Rameshwaram is an example of the fact that whenever a labourer’s heart fills with the spirit of patriotism, great accomplishments are achieved.
I am missing Amma here, and can feel the void.
If Amma was here today, in our midst, she would have been very happy to see the work done by the labourers and would have extended her good wishes.
She is a leader we all remember.
I believe her soul will continue to shower blessings for Tamil Nadu’s bright future.
Today, I want to request the people of the country from this holy land of Rameshwaram.
People from every corner of India come to visit Rameshwaram.
I request the tour operators, the visitors of Rameshwaram, and the young generation of the country that whenever you visit Rameshwaram, please visit this memorial for Abdul Kalam ji and inspire the new generation.
You must definitely come for this inspirational pilgrimage.

The Central Government under the Prime Minister’s Blue Revolution Scheme will help the fishermen.
And they have received big trawlers so that they can go for fishing in the deep sea.
It has begun today and some fishermen have received cheques from me.
Rameshwar’s land is also associated with Lord Ramchandra ji.
And today this is the land of Rameswaram, where in 1897, Swami Vivekanand ji landed after winning accolades abroad by enlightening them about India.
My congratulations to all the organizations working for Rameswaram’s future, especially the the Vivekananda Kendra.
The Indian Ocean and seven thousand five hundred kilometers long coastal line of India is full of investment potential.

You would be happy to note that DRDO has constructed this monument as a tribute to Abdul Kalam Ji.
The organization also undertakes welfare works for the people like this train which starts the journey from here today.
It is remarkable that in this train Shraddha Setu, from Rameshwaram to Ayodhya, all the toilets of this train are Bio Toilets.
This train, Shraddha Setu, will give a boost to our mission of clean India.
Friends, if Dr. Kalam has inspired someone the most, it is the youth of our country.
Today’s youth want to build up on his or her own strength.
Government of India has started programs like Startup India, Standup India so that the youth can realize their dreams.
Training centres and skill development centres have been opened in every district of the country for the skill development of youth.
Centre has started Mudra Scheme so that the youth do not have to face the problem of capital for staring their own enterprise.
And, I’m happy that among the beneficiaries more than one crore people are from Tamil Nadu alone.
Chennai, Koimbatoor, Madurai, Tanjavur, all these big cities are among the ten cities in the state which have been selected for the Smart City Mission.
Central government has released over Rs. 900 crore rupees for these cities; nearly one thousand crore rupees.
In addition the centre has approved Rs.4700 crores for Tamil Nadu.
This scheme will immensely benefit Rameshwaram and as well as the 33 other cities including Madurai, Tutikorin, Tirunveli and Nagar Coil.
Central government has also approved the expansion of the first phase of Chennai Metro at a cost of nearly 4,000 crore rupees.
Besides the centre has released nearly 18,000 crore rupees in the last three years for the rural roads in Tamil Nadu, for the expansion of self-help-groups, for the skill development of rural youth.
I’d like to make an appeal to the people and the Tamilnadu government.
I’d appeal to the state government to send the proposal, fast track the process of construction of the approved houses.
This inspiration is going to help us realize the dream of New India by 2022 when India will complete 75 years of its independence.
Our country will celebrate 75 years of its independence in 2022.
I can see this thing very clearly.
Once again I bow down to this massive crowd.
I respectfully offer tributes to Abdul Kalam Ji and also to late Amma.
Thank you very much to all of you.

Our commitment to peace is just as strong as our commitment to protect our people and our territory.
And for this, we are ready to take all steps required to equip our Armed Forces, including through the establishment of a strategically independent defence industrial complex.
We are also aware/ that the defence manufacturing sector is unique in terms of government involvement.
You need the government to grant a license to manufacture.
Since the government is almost the only buyer in India, you also need the government to grant an order.
And, you need the government even to grant permission to export.
Therefore, over the last few years, we have made a humble beginning.
Offset guidelines have been made flexible by allowing changes of Indian Offset Partners and offset components, even in contracts already signed.
Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers are now not required to indicate the details of Indian Offset Partners and products at the time of signing of contracts.
We have also re-instated Services as an avenue of discharging offsets.
The Standard Operating Procedure for issue of export authorizations has been simplified and put in public domain.
The requirement of Government-signed End User Certificate for export of parts and components and other non-sensitive military stores, sub-assemblies, and sub-systems has been done away with.
The Defence Procurement Procedure has also been revised, with many specific provisions for stimulating the growth of domestic defence industry.
We have also de-notified some items earlier made exclusively by Ordnance Factories, so that the private sector, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises can enter this space.
For encouraging the development of Micro and Small enterprises in the defence sector, the Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises– which was notified in 2012 – has been made mandatory from April 2015.
And we have seen some encouraging initial results.
In May 2014, the total number of defence licenses issued stood at 215.
In less than four years, we have issued 144 more licenses through a much more transparent and predictable process.
In May 2014, the total number of defence export permissions granted stood at 118, for a total value of 577 million dollars.
In less than four years, we have issued 794 more export permissions, for a total value of over 1.3 billion dollars.
From 2007 to 2013, the targeted offsets obligations were 1.24 billion dollars, of which only 0.79 billion dollars worth of offsets were actually discharged.
That is, an achievement rate of only about 63 percent.
From 2014 to 2017, the targeted offsets obligations were 1.79 billion dollars, of which 1.42 billion dollars’ worth of offsets were realized.
This is an achievement rate of close to 80 percent.
Procurement from Micro and Small Enterprises by the Defence Public Sector Undertakings and Ordnance Factories has gone up from about Rs. 3300 crores in 2014-15 to over Rs. 4250 crores in 2016-17.
This is an increase of close to 30 percent.
It is heartening to note that the contribution of small and medium scale sector to defence production has grown by 200 percent in the last 4 years.
And, they are increasingly also becoming part/ of the global supply chains.
I am also pleased that the share of Indian vendors in the procurement orders placed through defence capital expenditure has gone up from about 50 percent during 2011-14 to over 60 percent during the last three years.
We are committed to building a defence industrial complex that has room for everyone – public sector, private sector, as well as foreign firms.
We are committed to establishing two Defence Industrial Corridors – one right here in Tamil Nadu, and one in Uttar Pradesh.
These defence industrial corridors will utilize the existing defence manufacturing ecosystems in these regions, and further build upon it.
These corridors will become the engines of economic development and growth of defence industrial base in the country.
A Technology Perspective and Capability Road-map has been released to help the industry in planning and initiating technology development, partnerships and production arrangements.
In recent years, we have also taken various initiatives like Make In India, Startup India, and Atal Innovation Mission, to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in the Indian commercial eco-system.
Today, we have launched the ‘Innovation for Defence Excellence’ scheme.
It will set up Defence Innovation Hubs throughout the country to provide necessary incubation and infrastructure support to the start-ups in defence area.
Private venture capital into the defence sector, especially for start-ups will also be encouraged.
New and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Robotics are perhaps the most important determinants/ of defensive and offensive capabilities for any defence force in the future.
Dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in action”.
Our dream is to Develop the Ecosystem to Foster an Environment of New and Creative Entrepreneurship in the defence manufacturing sector.
And for this, in the weeks ahead, we will undertake extensive consultations with all stakeholders, including both Indian and Foreign companies, about our Defence Production and Defence Procurement policy space.
I call upon all of you to actively participate in this exercise.
But, we do not want to take short cuts.
There was a time when, like many other aspects of governance, the critical issue of defence preparedness was also hampered by policy paralysis.
We have seen the damage such laziness, incompetence or perhaps some hidden motives, can cause to the nation.
Not anymore.
Issues that should have been long addressed by previous governments, are being resolved now.
You would have seen how the issue of providing bullet proof jackets to Indian Army soldiers was kept hanging for years.
And, you would have also seen that we have brought the process to a successful conclusion with a contract that will provide a boost to defence manufacturing in India.
You would also recall the long-drawn process of procurement of fighter aircraft that never reached any conclusion.
We have not only taken bold action to meet our immediate critical requirements, but have also initiated a new process to procure 110 fighter aircraft.
Meaning, “In sandy soil, when deep you delve, you reach the springs below; The more you learn, the freer streams of wisdom flow.”
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated Phase 1 of the RO RO (Roll on, Roll off) ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej.
This ferry service shall reduce the travel time between Ghogha in Saurashtra, and Dahej in South Gujarat, from about seven or eight hours, to just over an hour.
Phase 1, inaugurated today, enables passenger movement.

Noting that this ferry service is a first of sorts, the Prime Minister said it is a dream come true for people of Gujarat.
He said that the history of human civilisation illustrates the vitality of rivers and maritime trade.
Gujarat is the land of Lothal; how can we forget these aspects of our history, he added.
This programme is to bring back to life our glorious past; and connect Saurashtra with South Gujarat, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that people from these two regions frequently travel to and fro; and this ferry service will save a lot of time, as well as fuel.
He said that other places too would be linked through ferries.
He said the goal of the Union Government is to make the transport sector integrated, and state-of-the-art.
The Prime Minister travelled on the maiden voyage of this service, from Ghogha to Dahej.
During this voyage, he was given a briefing about the ship, and the ferry service.
He also interacted with divyangjan children on board the ship.
Addressing a gathering in Dahej, the Prime Minister said that the Government’s vision is ports for prosperity.
India needs better ports and more ports, he added.
Without proper connectivity, the economic development of a nation slows down, he asserted, adding that the Government has focused on port infrastructure.
The Prime Minister mentioned the Government’s stress on the blue economy, which he said is integral to the vision of a new India.
In a Facebook post the Prime Minister said:
“India is delighted to host the 8th BRICS Summit in Goa on 15-16 October 2016, followed by a first-ever BRICS-BIMSTEC Outreach Summit.
I look forward to extending a warm welcome to the ten leaders of the BRICS and BIMSTEC families.
In Goa, I will also have the honour to receive President Vladimir Putin of Russia for the India-Russia Annual Summit and President Michel Temer of Brazil for a bilateral visit.
President Putin’s visit will give us an opportunity to consolidate and reaffirm a unique time-tested friendship and partnership with Russia.
I also look forward to useful conversations with my fellow leaders from China, South Africa, Brazil and Russia on addressing pressing international and regional challenges that stand in the way of our goals.
As Chair of the BRICS this year, India has embraced a stronger emphasis on promoting people-to-people linkages in diverse fields including trade, sports, education, films, scholarship, and tourism.
We will launch new initiatives in Goa even as we mark the successful operationalization of initiatives like the BRICS New Development Bank and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement.
I am optimistic that the BRICS Summit will strengthen intra-BRICS cooperation and advance our common agenda for development, peace, stability and reform.
In a first, I am happy that India is facilitating an outreach Summit with the BIMSTEC leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sir Lanka and Thailand.
Representing nearly two thirds of humanity together, we hope to tap the potential for cooperation and the dividends this will bring.
India looks forward to building bridges to new partnerships and finding common resolve and solutions to our entrenched problems.”
The Prime Minister shared his sentiments on Twitter saying, “My deepest gratitude to the Government of Afghanistan for conferring the Amir Amanullah Khan Award.”
It is the Highest Civilian honour bestowed by Afghan government to Afghan national as well as foreigners in appreciation of their services.
The citation on the reverse of the medal reads: “nishan-e dawlati Ghazi Amir Amanullah Khan”, or “State Order of Ghazi Amir Amanullah Khan.”
The award is named after the Afghan national hero, Amanullah Khan (Ghazi), who championed the cause of Afghanistan’s freedom.
He was the ruler of the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1919-1929 who led Afghanistan to independence.
King Amanullah advanced Afghanistan’s modernist constitution, incorporated equal rights and individual freedom.
The vision of King Amanullah for an independent and modern Afghanistan remains as relevant today as ever.
King Amanullah had strong ties with India, and moved here briefly in 1929.
His affectionate ties for the country continue to be reflected in the strong partnership between the two nations.
PM Modi received the Amir Amanullah Khan award following the inauguration of the Afghan-India Friendship Dam in Heart on 4 June.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today described former President Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam as one who was a “Rashtra-Ratna” before a “Rashtrapati.”
He was speaking at the birth anniversary celebrations of Dr. Kalam, at DRDO Bhavan in New Delhi.
The Prime Minister said that a memorial for Dr. Kalam would be built at Rameswaram, to inspire future generations.
The Prime Minister said that while most people look for opportunities in life, Dr. Kalam always sought fresh challenges to overcome.
He recalled how he worked closely with Dr. Kalam during the post-earthquake reconstruction work in Kutch.
Recalling that Dr. Kalam wished to be remembered as a teacher, the Prime Minister said that the former President was well-aware of the importance of nurturing future generations.
He said that on the birth anniversary for Dr. Kalam, we must explore how we can encourage innovation in India.
The Prime Minister mentioned several vital sectors where innovation was essential, including cyber-security, housing for all, river-linking, enhancing agricultural productivity, blue economy, and zero-defect, zero-effect manufacturing.
The Prime Minister said that Dr. Kalam had not only risen himself, from humble beginnings to the highest office in India, but had also built great institutions, virtually from scratch.
He said all of us should draw inspiration from his example.
Earlier, the Prime Minister unveiled a statue of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam at DRDO Bhavan.
He opened and witnessed a photo exhibition titled – “A Celebration of Dr. Kalam’s Life.”
It’s almost like day and night.
The weather here, as I can see, is very pleasant.

He will unveil a statue of Deenbandhu Sir Chhotu Ram.
Sir Chhotu Ram was a prominent leader, who worked ceaselessly for the welfare of farmers, and the emancipation of the backward and downtrodden.
He said that in the last two and a half decades, NHRC has contributed to nation building, by becoming the voice of the deprived and the oppressed.
He said that the protection of human rights has been an important part of our culture.
He said that after independence, elements such as an independent and impartial judiciary; an active media; an active civil society, and organizations such as NHRC are in place to protect human rights.
The Prime Minister said that human rights should not be merely a slogan, but also a part of our ethos.
He said that in the last four years or so, a lot of serious efforts have been made to improve the quality of life of the poor.
He said that the Government’s focus has been to ensure that all Indians have access to the basic needs of human beings.
In this context, he mentioned the achievements of schemes such as BetiBachao, BetiPadhao, Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan, Pradhan MantriAwaasYojana, UjjwalaYojana, and SaubhagyaYojana; and the transformation that has been brought about in the lives of the people as a result of these schemes.

These include restructuring the deferred payment liabilities of spectrum auction of telecom service providers and revising the limit of the cap for spectrum holding for telecom service providers.
1. Restructuring of Deferred Payment Liabilities of telecom Service providers for spectrum
The total amount received will be higher by Rs. 74446.01 crore till 2034-35.
The overall spectrum cap is revised from the current limit of 25% to 35%.
The current intra-band cap is removed.
Instead, there is a cap of 50% on the combined spectrum holding in the sub-1 GHz bands (700 MHz, 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands).
There will be no cap for individual or combined spectrum holding in above 1 GHz band.
The revised spectrum caps limits may be revisited after Final Acts of World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC) 2019.
TRAI had recommended revision in the existing limits of cap for spectrum holding taking into consideration the technological advancement, efficient use of spectrum, measures to facilitate consolidation etc.
With the restructuring of the deferred payment liability, the cash flow for the telecom service providers will increase in the immediate timeframe providing them some relief.
Revising the limit for the spectrum cap holding will facilitate consolidation of telecom licensees and may encourage the participation in the future auction.
Cabinet approves redevelopment of seven GPRA colonies in Delhi

How do we rejuvenate our traditional heritage which was lying inactive for 20, 25 or 30 years?
And when I say “Sankalp Se Siddhi”, we can see for ourselves as to how a Cleanliness Campagin is advancing towards Sankalp Siddhi, that is Attainment through Reslove.
One thing was common and that was to live for the country, do something for the nation; they led the people not by mere sermons but by their actions.
Gandhiji, Jai Prakashji, Deen Dayalji were such great personalities who remained far away from the corridors of power but lived every moment for the people, kept fighting all odds following the principle “Sarv Jan Hitay – Sarv Jan Sukhay”, they kept endeavouring tirelessly.
I would like to re-iterate to my countrymen, and specially to my young friends that we are alive & aware beings.
People of North India may not be knowing what all is there in the South!
How many varieties of cuisines there are !
Internalize India within yourselves.
And, who can be a better teacher than experience!
A thought comes to my mind, that in order to promote tourism in India what could be the seven best tourist destinations in your state – every Indian must know about these seven tourist spots of his state.
In other words, how can tourist destination be developed keeping public aspirations in mind?

PM to visit Uttar Pradesh on May 01, 2016
PM to launch Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana from Ballia
PM to attend various functions in Varanasi
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will visit Uttar Pradesh tomorrow.
He will launch the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana from Ballia.
The Prime Minister will also visit his constituency, Varanasi.
He will distribute e-rickshaws to beneficiaries.
He will visit Gyan Pravah – Centre for Cultural Studies and Research – at Varanasi.
He will hold a meeting with prominent citizens in Varanasi.
You will leave this place with so much curiosity that you will feel like that as a citizen of India the more you know the country, the more you know about every corner of the country, the more you know India’s diversity the more you feel one with the country.
The seed of this value systemis naturally sown within us in every NCC camp.
It seems to us that we are participating in the parade, it seems like that we have come here wearing the uniform, it seems like that we are preparing for Raj Path but we don’t even realise when we start cherishing this massive India within us; how do we become so full of the country.
We don’t even know that how do we develop a strong feeling to do something for India?
Such an eco system, such an environment that makes us think about the country, think about its future and our role, our duties in this thing every single moment.
We are going to go back after getting inspiration for all these things.
NCC cadets participating in the parade at Raj Path and those who did not get the opportunity to participate in the parade or being seen on the Raj Path, those who work in the background, those who labored extremely hard for a month, for every such person, the guests from 10 countries, the entire country and Indian Diaspora spread across the world takes pride in every step taken by you people.
They were proud of the every step taken by you and they felt that our country was marching ahead when you people were taking your steps.
When you showed your extreme courage then every countrymen felt that the courage of the country was going to the top.
This environment, this atmosphere should not be confined to this place only.
The real test begins after that.
NCC is known for its discipline and unity.
NCC is not a mechanism.
NCC is a mission.
Why all these things?
Why the money of the poorest of the poor person of the country is being spent on all these things?
This is being invested so that this kind of nucleus, this kind of individuals continue to be created within the country with a mission mode thatcontinue to inspire others, so that the determination of the country continues to increase and that is why in a way it’s an effort to develop the lives and develop the country through those developed lives.
If we leave all these things here and these memories are going to be used just for sharing them with friends for the rest of life then something is missing.
We should take pride in the fact that after the independence of the country the NCC act was enacted before the enactment of rules and regulation for the armed forces.
Nation building was linked with the young generation of the country and given priority over security of the nation.
Today, NCC has completed 70 years.
The journey of seven decades, and millions and millions of NCC cadets like me moved on the path of life by receiving the values of patriotism.
Friends, we get a sense of mission from NCC.
On the completion of 70 years of NCC the time demands that we should take a look at these things like: where we came from, where we have come and where we want to take the country.
What should be the form of this NCC and what are the new things that should be added in the NCC?
What should be its expanse?
I don’t believe that any youth of my country is willing to tolerate corruption.
The society has a feeling of hatred against corruption.
But why should we restrict ourselves to just have the feeling of hatred against corruption, why should we just express our anguish and anger against corruption?
Will this thing be enough?
Then we will have to continue to wage this battle for a prolonged period, it is not going to stop.
This fight against corruption, this fight against black money is aimed at making the future of the youth of my country.
And if the future of the youth of my country is secured then it is going to make the future of our country.
But, I, Prime Minister of this country want to ask something from the Indian youth, I want to ask something from NCC cadets.
I know that you will never disappoint me.
The youth of my country will not disappoint me.
I am neither going to ask for votes nor am I going to ask your help so that we can progress on political front.
If I want your help, the help of youth of my country, then I want your help for setting this country free from this corruption which is like a termite.
You might feel that what you could do.
At best, you might decide that: we will not bribe anyone or at best we will not accept any bribe.
You will do that in any case but this will not be sufficient.
There is one thing, one task and if you make a pledge, if you make a rule that every year you would associate at least 100 new families with this thing, then what is that thing.
If accountability is there, if transparency is there, then there is an automatic change in the situation.
Can you make a pledge that wherever we go for purchasing things, wherever there is an exchange of money, then we will not do it in cash, all of us have become mobile users.
Whether we will download the BHIM App and make every purchase through BHIM App?
And whether you will insist on using the BHIM App at the shop from where you purchase things, whichever store or mall you may be visiting, whether you will insist on using it or not?
You must do it.
Please develop a habit of this thing.
You will see this kind of transparency will be there, fixing accountability will become so easy and we will be able to take strong steps in the direction of making a corruption free India.
And it can’t be done without the help of my youth.
If my NCC cadets take up this task on a mission mode then no one will have courage to drag the country towards corruption.
Even if an extremely corrupt person succeeds in occupying a high office even then he will be forced to follow the path of honesty.
Sometimes there was a lot of despair in the country that lofty things are discussed against the corruption but nothing could be done against powerful people.
Today, you people have been passing through such a period, you are passing through such a time that at least three chief ministers are behind bars due to corruption.
Who can say that there is no God, who can say that there is no justice in the house of God?
Now there is no one to protect them.
If we eradicate these evils then it benefits the most to the poor people of the country.
When the money is spent in the proper manner then a poor household gets the affordable medicine.
When the money is spent in the proper manner then it creates the facilities for providing good schools, good teachers to the children of a poor person.
When the money is spent in the proper way then the roads are being laid up to villages, when the money is properly utilized then an opportunity for doing something for the oppressed, exploited and excluded people of the country is created.
That day is not far away when the country which will have data will be considered powerful.
The girl that never born used to grow up into an adult, marry and become widow in the records of a government office and widow pension was paid to her from the government exchequer.
This kind of business was going on but now the legitimate claimants could be identified due to Aadhaar and they have started getting their rights due to direct transfer of benefits.
All this is possible.
And therefore my youth should move forward in the direction of a cashless society with the mantra of less cash and by optimally using the BHIM App for all the selling and purchasing and even if we need to pay the fee then we will pay it through BHIM App.
Then you will see how the changes will come about in the country.
My young friends, you people have got a good experience in the life.
You people have got the opportunity to experience the country by living with the people from all corners of the country in a very short span of time.
You people got that feeling; you got a new touch of India.
With this new spirit, with this new resolve, with this new aspiration, all of us should collectively move forward with a solemn pledge to make a New India.
We should take the country forward, we should make a New India with the strength to fulfill the dreams of our freedom fightersby 2022 when India will celebrate 75 years of its independence.
My best wishes to all of you.

“Remembering the noble ideals and pure thoughts of Maharshi Valmiki on Valmiki Jayanti.
His impact on our society is phenomenal”, the Prime Minister said.
Fewer things give greater joy than getting together with good friends to celebrate successful completion of joint initiatives.
You and I have been fortunate to have done so on important occasions in the past months.
In December last year, you and the Afghan people stood with me to inaugurate the Afghan Parliament.
The inauguration signaled and showed our joint commitment to strengthening the foundations of modern Afghanistan.
The India-Afghanistan-Iran transit corridor Agreement that we signed in May this year was another land mark in our partnership.
Today’s video inauguration of Stor palace is an entirely different, yet in many ways more fundamental, dimension of our engagement.
I say this because it brings back to life a valuable landmark of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage.
The Stor palace has been the setting for many momentous historical events.
To those who cannot see beyond shadows of violence in Afghanistan, the restored Stor palace is a reminder of the glory of Afghanistan’s rich traditions.
Afghanistan is a close friend.
Our societies and people have had age old ties and links.
It, therefore, saddens us to see that your proud nation continues to be challenged by externally sponsored instruments and entities of violence and terror.
Today’s event is a testimony to the resolve and range of our cooperative endeavours .
We want each Afghan to flourish and your society to be benefited from fruits of economic growth.
Whatever may be the odds, India will work with you for a bright future for all Afghans.
In the end, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and your Government for protecting Indian Embassy and Consulates and ensuring the safety and security of Indian experts working in Afghanistan.
The sacrifices made by our Afghan brothers will not be forgotten.
I once again thank you for your presence today.
I look forward to seeing you in person soon.
I also hope to have an opportunity to visit the renovated Stor palace someday.
Thank you, Thank you very much.
The total financial implication for implementation of various components is around Rs. 1005.99 crores.
This includes Rs. 898.50 crores as the fixed cost of strengthening and creation of infrastructure in Cooch Behar district and Bangladesh enclaves in India.
Besides, a variable cost of Rs. 107.49 crores is likely to be incurred for the rehabilitation.
The actual variable cost would depend upon the actual number of families returning to India.
The rehabilitation package and upgradation of infrastructure of the Bangladeshi enclaves and Cooch Behar district after transfer of enclaves between India and Bangladesh follows the two proposals received from the Government of West Bengal.
The rehabilitation measures such as infrastructure development and rehabilitation assistance will help seamless integration of areas and people.
His brilliant acting will be remembered for generations to come.

However, the mindset has been changed and it is visible now.
He said “at one point of time there was a mindset among people that nothing can change.
Talking about India’s strength, PM said ,“Terrorists attacked Mumbai, what happened after it?
In our government, Uri happened, what happened after it?
This is the change”.

May his soul rest in peace”, the Prime Minister said.
The Cadre review of IDAS has come in the wake of the functional requirements, cadre structure and career progression of the officials belonging to the service.
I am delighted to address the International Workshop on Rule of Law and Sustainable Development.
This workshop is being organized soon after two important international agreements which happened during 2015.
One is the Paris Agreement on climate change.
The other is the Agreement on Sustainable Development Goals.
Therefore, this conference provides a timely and useful opportunity to discuss the way forward.
This is important not only in the national context but also in the global context.
I hope you will keep in mind the welfare of mankind and the concerns of the international community in your deliberations.
The role of rules and laws in achieving sustainable development goals is going to be very important in the days to come.
However, rules should be such that they facilitate the achievement of these goals.
Unfortunately, some times, the concern for environment is defined narrowly.
We all have to realize that if there is conflict, no one’s purpose will be served.
I hope that you will show us the way to build and ensure climate justice across the globe based on legal as well as social frameworks.
These goals reflect our evolving understanding of the social, economic and environmental linkages that define our lives.
This was followed by the COP-21 where we contributed significantly in shaping the narrative.
Our commitments at COP-21 underline the Indian ethos which aims at changing human lifestyle along with changes in the manner in which we engage in economic activity.
The problems of environment are largely the effect of our consumptive lifestyles.
If we want to make a meaningful impact, we all need to look within; before we read the books of law.
I have always felt that anything which is not sustainable cannot be called development.
This cannot happen unless the development process is inclusive and sustainable.
Anything which compromises on the ability of future generations to meet their requirements cannot be called development.
We in India have always believed in sustainability.
For us, the law of nature holds great value.
If we all observe it, then many man-made laws will not be required.
In modern terminology, there is a word called stakeholder.
A path becomes sustainable, if all stakeholders are benefitted.
However, I must add a word of caution here.
It cannot be stretched to include those who may be working with ulterior motives.
Nature is pure.
Hence, only pure intentions can keep it intact.
We, in India, have a strong tradition of living in harmony with nature.
These elements of Nature have been given the stature of Gods in our culture.
Moreover, in Indian mythology, most of the Gods and Goddesses are associated with an animal and a tree.
Thus, respect for Nature is an integral part of our culture, and has been passed across generations.
Protection of environment comes naturally to us.
This strong tradition has been a guiding principle for all of us.
This is our commitment; not of today but since time immemorial.
If we remember this, follow this and act accordingly, India could provide leadership in sustainable development.
When I talk of yoga, it is not just its physical dimension.
Yoga is very comprehensive.
The ideas of YAM, NIYAM, PRATYAHAR teach us discipline, austerity and control.
Therefore, eradication of poverty is one of the fundamental goals of my government.
Guided by our core values, we are working towards achieving this goal with sincerity.
We aim to do all this in a sustainable manner.
We realize that fulfilling the demand for energy is vital to the achievement of our development goals.
This is why, one of the first challenges that we took up was generation of 175 Giga watts of renewable energy.
We are well on our way to achieving this objective.
We have also taken up the Swacch Bharat and Clean Ganga Initiatives.
I am happy to note that millions of people across the country have joined the cleanliness drive.
I take this opportunity to invite the participants to explore as to how we can strengthen this collective endeavour.
The problems we face in India today are not unique.
Other civilizations have also faced similar problems and were able to overcome them.
I believe that through our collective efforts we will succeed as well.
While doing so, we must ensure that we avoid contradictions between our need to develop and develop sustainably.
Our culture teaches us Union between the व्यक्ति and समस्ती.
If we become one with the universal order, there are no conflicts of interest.
Therefore, my Government is treating the challenge of adapting to climate change as an opportunity rather than a problem.
We must do things in a way that causes minimum damage to the environment.
This is what I mean when I talk of zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
I have written some of my thoughts on this theme in my book, Convenient Action: continuity for change.
The rule of law dictates that no one can be punished for another’s misdeed.
We need to recognize that there are many people who are least responsible for the problem of climate change.
They are also the people who still wait for access to modern amenities.
They face the adverse impact of climate change more than anyone else.
This includes cyclones, droughts, floods, heat waves, and rising sea levels.
The poor, vulnerable and marginalized groups have fewer resources to cope with climate disasters.
Unfortunately, their present and future generations are also burdened by laws and agreements on environment.
That is why I talk about Climate Justice.
Moreover, the rules, laws, practices and principles of one country cannot be applied to another uniformly.
Every country has its own challenges and its own ways of dealing with them.
If we apply the same set of rules for all countries and for all people; it will not work.
Sustainable development is our responsibility.
I am confident that we can achieve it, collectively.
I am also confident that we can find ways for development which are in harmony with nature.
We can find them along the road travelled by our forefathers.
I hope the deliberations during this workshop will help in developing a shared understanding of these imperatives.
“Earth Day is a day of gratitude to Mother Earth and a day to reiterate our firm resolve to keep our planet clean and green.
It is our duty to live in harmony with the plants, animals and birds we share the Earth with.
We owe this to our future generations.
I hope this year’s theme of ‘Environmental and Climate Literacy’ helps create awareness on protecting nature and natural resources.”
It will empower the poor and live up to the expectations of all.
It will provide an impetus to infrastructure, strength to the financial system and a big boost to the development.
The budget has provisions to fulfill the expectations of everyone- from construction of highways to expansion of I-ways, from the cost of pulses to the data speed, from the modernization of railways to simple economic constructions, from education to health, from entrepreneurs to industry, from textile manufacturers to tax deduction.
The Finance Minister and his entire team deserve praise for this historic budget.
This Budget is a reflection of the development measures undertaken by the Government over the past two and a half years and the vision to carry forward the momentum in this direction.
The merger of the Railway budget with the Union Budget is a major step.
It will help in integrated planning of the transport sector.
The allocation for the schemes in these categories has been hiked substantially.
The budgetary outlay for Railways and Road transport sector have also been substantially increased.
Government’s aim is to double the farmers’ income by 2022 and the policies and schemes have been designed keeping this in mind.
Maximum emphasis in this budget has been on the farmers, villages, poor, dalit and the underprivileged sections of the society.
Agriculture, animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, watershed development, Swachcha Bharat Mission are the areas which hold lots of potential to uplift the economic situation in rural India and also bring a sea change in the quality of life there.
The Budget has laid emphasis on increasing the employment opportunities.
Special allocation has been made for the sectors like Electronic manufacturing, Textiles which create new job opportunities.
Provisions have been made to bring in the people working in the unorganized sector to the organized sector.
Budget allocation for Skill development has been enhanced considerably keeping in mind the youth of our country and the need to gain the advantage from the demographic dividend.
Record allocation –the highest ever has been made for Mahatma Gandhi National Guarantee Scheme.
Women’s welfare is a priority for our Government.
Budgetary outlay for the schemes related to women’s and children welfare has been enhanced.
There has been a considerable hike in the allocation of budget for health and higher education.
Housing and Construction Sector plays a major role in the growth of economy and creating new employment opportunities.
This budget will provide an impetus to the housing sector in rural as well as urban areas.
In the Railway budget, special emphasis has been on railway safety.
We have undertaken the exercise to launch Digital economy in a mission mode which will go a long way in achieving the target of 2500 crore digital transactions in 2017-18.
The Finance Minister has brought in tax reforms and amendments which will provide relief to the Middle Class, result in setting up of industries, create job opportunities , will put an end to discrimination and will provide incentives for private investments.
The move to reduce the personal income tax is significant as it touches the middle class most.
The small and medium industries across the country have been a major source of employment generation.
These industries have been demanding that they are facing difficulties in competing at the global level and if the taxes are lowered, then around 90 percent of our small scale industries would be benefitted.
Therefore, the Government has amended the definition of Small scale industries, widened their scope and reduced the tax rate from 30 to 25 percent.
This implies that over 90 percent of our Small scale industries will be benefitted.
I am hopeful that this decision will help a lot in making our SSIs globally competitive.
This budget is an important step towards overall development of the nation.
It will create new employment opportunities, help in overall economic growth and will be complementary in raising the income of the farmers.
In order to ensure quality of life for the citizens, the best possible facilities of education, health and housing can be organized.
It is an effort to raise the purchasing power of the middle class without increasing the fiscal deficit.
In a way, it is a reflection of our ongoing efforts to see to it that the speed with which our country is changing, gather momentum.
I congratulate the Finance Minister once again to present this FUTURE in the budget.
It is my belief that the budget will carry forward the development agenda of the Government, generate a new climate of confidence and help the nation to scale new heights.
Besides other changes, the Protocol updates the existing provisions for exchange of information to the latest international standards.
Senior officials from the Government of India, and the State of Maharahtra, were also present.

It was presented to him by the Prime Minister of the Mongolian People’s Republic, as a unique bibliographic rarity.
This Kanjur was revised, edited and xylographed from 1908 to 1920 under the patronage of the last Jibcundampa of Mongolia.
It was collated with the Derge and two Chinese editions (Rgya-par-mag Uis).
It retains the order of the Tshal-pa Kanjur, which is based on the old catalogue Hphan-than-ma.
Its size (35x25cm) is smaller than that of the known xylographed editions.
The Prime Minister said the life of the tribal communities was marked by intense struggle.
Yet, he added, the tribal communities had imbibed the ideals of community living, and of living cheerfully despite troubles.
He recalled that it is difficult to hear a complaint escape their lips.
In this respect, he added, the people living in urban areas can draw inspiration from them.
The Prime Minister gave several illustrations of innovations that had made a positive difference in the lives of the tribal communities.
In this context, he mentioned the Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana.
The Prime Minister complimented the tribal communities for their role in the conservation of forests.
The Prime Minister said most of our natural resources and forests were found in the same parts of the country, as tribal communities.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Chhatrapati Shivaji on his birth anniversary.
“My tributes to the great Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on his birth anniversary.
The valour of Chhatrapati Shivaji is legendary.
Words can’t do justice to indomitable courage & fighting spirit.
Chhatrapati Shivaji is remembered as a torchbearer of good governance and as an accomplished administrator.
He remains an inspiration for all of us.” the Prime Minister said.
Apart from Yoga, I walk on a track inspired by the Panchtatvas or 5 elements of nature – Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Vayu, Aakash.
This is extremely refreshing and rejuvenating.
I also practice breathing exercises. #HumFitTohIndiaFit.
I appeal to every Indian to devote some part of the day towards fitness.
Practice any set of exercises you are comfortable with and you will see the positive difference it will make in your life! #FitnessChallenge #HumFitTohIndiaFit.”
I begin ‘Mann Ki Baat’ today with a heavy heart.
All around, there is a deluge of strong feelings of sympathy for the martyrs & their family members.
This martyrdom will keep inspiring us relentlessly to uproot the very base of terrorism; it will fortify our resolve.
He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy; if need be, he himself would go and fight.
The mettle of this innocent lad is a representative sample of the feelings of each &every child of the Nation today.
To understand the virtues of patriotism, sacrifice and perseverance, one doesn’t need to revert to historical events.
This new memorial has been instituted in the heart of Delhi, in close vicinity of India Gate and Amar JawanJyoti.
It is a gallery whose walls are inscribed with soldiers’ tales of valour.
If you take a holistic view, the National Soldiers’ Memorial is sure to turn out to be a sacred site, where people will throng, to get information on our great martyrs, to express their gratitude, to conduct further research on them.
This place stands testimony to a series of sacrifices of men who laid down their lives for the sake of their country, so that we could live, so that the country could be safe & secure, paving the way for development.
Once while I was going through your comments, I came across an interesting point by AtishMukhopadhyayji.
Today, if an inspiring personality is required for ably guiding our youth, it certainly is that of BhagwanBirsaMunda.
BhagwanBirsaMunda took on the might of the guns & cannons of the British, using traditional bows and arrows, to shake them apart.
BhagwanBirsaMunda not only waged a struggle against the British for political freedom; he also actively fought for the social & economic rights of the tribal folk.
But it’s a misfortune that these tales of valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generations.
In reality they are true ‘Karmyogis,’ who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and, above all, in the service to the nation.
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who at first tried to empower the downtrodden and the exploited through the Kalanjiyam movement in Tamil Nadu and initiated community based microfinancing.
At present, whenever I’m touring, it is my sincere effort to meet people beneficiaries of ‘PMJAY’ scheme under Ayushman Bharat’s umbrella.
It is just not possible that a day passes without any significance associated with it, or does not herald a festival!
In maintainingrespect for healthy democratic traditions, the next episode of ‘Mann KiBaat’ will be broadcast on the last Sunday of the month of May.
This means I shall take up our thoughts and ideas accumulated over the three months of March, April & entire May after the Elections, with confidence anew.
A group of over 100 Anganwadi workers from across the country, called on the Prime Minister today to express their happiness, and thank the Prime Minister for the recent announcement of increase in honorarium and other incentives.
The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of nutrition in a child’s physical and cognitive development.
He said the Anganwadi workers have a key role to play in this regard.
He said nutrition requires constant focus and development of good habits, which can be provided by Anganwadi workers.
He exhorted them to ensure that the nutritional assistance being made available to beneficiaries is used judiciously.
Children will listen more to Anganwadi workers.
They have a key role in generating awareness.
He encouraged healthy competition among Anganwadis, as a motivation for better nutritional care and efforts among various Anganwadi workers.
PM gives away the “Times Now” Amazing Indians Awards 2016
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave away the “Times Now” Amazing Indians Awards 2016.
The awards were given in recognition of great achievements in the face of adversity.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said the awardees were people whose life journey had been like a diamond, that passes through great travails before being recognized and acknowledged by the world at large.
The Prime Minister regretted that in India, most of the narrative has been built around the lives of those in power, or the ruling class.
Those who have struggled and achieved noble objectives, or served society, despite severe obstacles and adversity, are rarely recognized and celebrated, he added.
The Prime Minister complimented Times Now for discovering and presenting to the world at large, the awardees for the day, and said their work would inspire many others.
He complimented the awardees for their achievements.
After that the tenure of the NCSK has been extended as a non-statutory body from time to time.
The tenure of the present Commission is upto 31.3.2019.
The NCSK has been giving its recommendations to the Government regarding specific programmes for welfare of SafaiKaramcharis, study and evaluate the existing welfare programmes for SafaiKaramcharis, investigate cases of specific grievances etc.
Though the Government has taken many steps for the upliftment of the SafaiKaramcharis, the deprivation suffered by them in socio-economic and educational terms is still far from being eliminated.
Further the practice of manual scavenging is still prevalent in the country and its eradication continues to be an area of the highest priority for the Government.
Hence, the Government feels that there is a continued need to monitor the various interventions and initiatives of the Government for welfare of SafaiKaramcharis and to achieve the goal of complete eradication of the practice of manual scavenging in the country.
Therefore, the Cabinet has approved the present proposal for grant of extension of the tenure of National Commission for SafaiKaramcharis (NCSK) for three more years beyond 31.3.2019.
The amendment will reduce the redundancy.
The clauses being amended include those pertaining to certain modifications in the provisions of the Dentists Act, 1948 with regard to:
However, it has lost relevance.
With a view to reducing the redundancy of the provisions of their representation, the Central Government has decided to delete these provisions so that their representation does not remain mandatory any more.
My thoughts are with his family and supporters in this hour of grief”, the Prime Minister said.

Deputy Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Nitin Patel
Business Leaders from both countries;
Ladies and Gentlemen!
It is a real pleasure to be with the business community of Japan and India.
Today, that dream has come true.
I am happy to see so many friends from Japan happily living and doing business in Gujarat.
It also gives me great pleasure to see so many familiar faces here.
I am also happy to see that dedicated townships, clusters and institutions have come up to make the Japanese life and work experience better.
Gujarat’s Industry and Government still cherish the fact that Japan became the first partner country in the Vibrant Gujarat event.
Not only did this partnership continue, but our engagement has kept growing.
This closeness and understanding has helped us bridge a number of gaps in our bilateral relations.
Last year has seen the highest ever disbursement of Official Development Assistance from Japan in a financial year.
Similarly, the number of Japanese companies working in India has gone up steadily in the last few years.
• I hope that the construction of the 500-km long bullet train will begin soon and it would become operational by 2022–23.
• It will prepare the Makers of a New India – the highly skilled manpower required to build, operate and maintain the high speed railway.
• Second is the Development of Japanese Industrial Townships: Country-wide, four locations have been finalized.
Apart from Gujarat, they are located in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
• Third is our cooperation in auto-mobiles:
The Suzuki plant at Maandal is exporting cars world-wide, and foundation has been laid for production of Lithium-ion batteries to power the next generation hybrid and electric vehicles.
In addition to Gujarat, they will be developed in Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.
• You know that the ancient and holy city of Varanasi is my second home.
I have named it Rudraksh – the symbol of love, and a Prasad of Lord Shiva to Humanity.
It will also be a tribute to our shared Buddhist heritage present at Sarnath too.
We have concluded a number of agreements on very important matters.
All this shows the depth of our understanding and the comfort and confidence which we have with each other.
These reforms and initiatives are all aimed at preparing India for the 21st century.
We are also developing India into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven society.
The Start-Up India initiative also aims to build a strong eco-system of innovation.
In fact, all of India’s development agenda is relevant for Japanese companies.
To allow entry of capital and technology, we have worked hard on opening our economy.
Every day we are making it easier to invest and do business in India.
We have already resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies.
We have got very good results of these efforts.
With this, we are also moving towards a modern tax regime, which is transparent, stable and predictable.
Today, India has one of the most liberal FDI regimes in the world.
This liberalization has seen India’s FDI reach 60 billion dollars in the last financial year.
India needs affordable solutions and processes which can ease the delivery of government services to its citizens.
Japan needs opportunities where it can deploy its hard earned knowledge and technology.
Their life stories illustrate the power of dedication and a never-say-die attitude that made them overcome countless hurdles to attain the heights of success they did at the CWG.
On our part, we in the Government are doing everything possible to strengthen the FitIndia movement”, the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets.
These include: (a) 500 MW additional power supply from India to Bangladesh, through the existing Bheramara (Bangladesh) – Baharampur (India) interconnection. (b) Akhaura – Agartala Rail Link (c) Rehabilitation of the Kulaura-Shahbazpur section of Bangladesh Railways.

Prime Minister Modi recalled Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina’s vision of restoring connectivity to the way it was before 1965.
He said this is being done using the transmission link between West Bengal and Bangladesh, and thanked the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Ms. Mamata Banerjee for her facilitation in completion of this work.
He said that with the completion of this project, 1.16 Gigawatts of power is now being supplied from India to Bangladesh.

“Greetings on Valmiki Jayanti.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following schemes of M/o DONER for continuation till March, 2020:
Apart from this, some funds are provided – both Revenue and Capital – as 100% Central funding basis, implemented through State and Central agencies.
The Scheme of NEC – Special Development Project will be changed to be a Central Sector Scheme with 100% grant, instead of the earlier block grant on 90:10 basis.
The remaining component will continue to be funded on 100% Central funding basis as at present.
Transferred from DONER to NEC for implementation, the scheme is 100% Centrally funded.
A sum of Rs. 1000 crore has been allocated under the scheme.
Another Scheme namely “Non Lapsable Central Pool of Resources-Central [NLCPR (Central)]”, presently funded by M/o DoNER, provides resources to the concerned line Ministries/their agencies for projects like Agartala-Akhaura Rail Link, checking erosion in Majuli Island.
This Scheme will also be transferred to NEC for implementation.
Previously, there was no fixed arrangement for distributing the funds into State or Central component.
Now, the total funds available to NEC are proposed to be bifurcated in two components (State component – 60% and Central component – 40%).
The State component would be utilised for the projects in each State as per their share on normative allocation basis.
For the Central component, the projects having regional character, requiring Inter-Ministerial intervention are to be taken up.
By the above, a clear apportionment or division of sectors is ensured between DoNER and NEC to avoid duplication.
In order to give a boost to the Tourism in NE Region, amongst other things, the outstanding liabilities in tourism sector under Product Infrastructure Development for Destinations & Circuits (PIDDC) may also be addressed.
Further, a mechanism on the pattern of Standing Finance Committee (SFC) with representatives from the concerned line Ministries and from Ministry of DoNER would be constituted under the Chairmanship of Secretary, NEC for approval of the projects costing between Rs. 5-15 crore.
This is aimed at bringing synergy with programmes of other Union Ministries and avoiding of duplication through process of SFC.
It will clear the way for faster revival of Barauni unit of HFCL.

(b) Incorporation of a new Government company as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the implementation and development of the project with 100% equity from Government through Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion.
Phase-1 of the project comprising trunk infrastructure along with Exhibition cum Convention Centre will be implemented and commissioned by December 2019.
Project is estimated to generate over five lakh direct and indirect employment opportunities.
The Prime Minister stressed upon the need to speed up the redevelopment of Railway Stations, and urged the Railways to substantially raise its level of ambition in this regard.
He emphasized the need for the Railways to upgrade and diversify the uses of its infrastructure.
He reiterated that railway infrastructure in rural areas could be used for activities such as skill development, and this could also result in an increase in non-fare revenue for the railways.
In the roads sector, the Prime Minister was informed that over 6000 kilometres of highways were completed in 2015-16, while contracts for another 10,098 kilometres were awarded in the same period.

Welcome to India!
Welcome Home!
I am happy to be part of this new beginning for Smart Governance in the North East.
The launch of Integrated Command and Control Centres in Gangtok, Namchi, Pasighat, Itanagar and Agartala is a welcome step.
The urban centres of the North East, with their pool of skilled human resource, have the potential to emerge as growth hubs for the entire region.
The Smart City Mission enables cities to identify their potential and challenges.
It catalyses smart solutions for the challenges, through public consultation.
Smart City Command and Control Centres use digital technology to integrate different service networks.
They enable real-time collaboration among departments such as Police, Transport, Power, Water, Sanitation, and Public Safety utilities.
I believe that with the system in place, administrators will be able to monitor city operations better and respond in real time.
The implementation of Integrated Command and Control Centres is gathering pace across India.
As on the First of March 2019, these Centres have already become functional in fifteen Smart Cities.
Work is in progress at fifty other Centres.
I am told that the North-East will have its first completed Smart Command and Control Centre as early as October 2019.
One of the key components of the system is the CCTV Surveillance system for Citizen Safety.
This system is designed to help tackle crime.
The Intelligent Traffic Management System will help ease traffic flow.
The Solid Waste Management component in the Command and Control Centre will boost cleanliness in these cities.
Smart Street Lighting will make our streets safer and citizen friendly.
It will also improve energy efficiency through the conversion to LED systems.
Smart cities are also installing Public-Address Systems and Variable Message Signs to communicate important civic information.
Digital access is an important component of Digital India Mission.
Public Wi-Fi system will provide free internet access to Citizens.
The North-East is an environmentally sensitive region.
The Environmental Monitoring System and Disaster Management modules will give real time information to Citizens and Government.
It will help improve the overall quality of life of Citizens.
As cities start implementing and expanding the different elements of this system, they will be able to improve Ease of Living for their citizens.
I am told that there are over 500 projects with a total worth of nearly 15,000 crore rupees in the ten Smart Cities in the North East.
Work orders have already been issued for 59 of these projects.
I am happy to see Namchi in Sikkim, begin work on its Integrated Water Supply projects, LED Street lights and footpaths.
Water is becoming a huge challenge in our hill cities.
Gangtok has started work on rain water harvesting.
It has also undertaken projects to construct multi-level car parks with Smart Parking features to ease traffic congestion.
Agartala has its own unique challenges due to its saucer-shaped geography that makes it vulnerable to floods.
The city administration has taken up projects to manage the same under the Smart Cities Mission.
Itanagar has plans to improve its city road network through its Smart Roads and Intelligent Traffic and Transport Management system.
Pasighat is addressing the challenges of housing, energy management and business development through key Smart City projects.
So, each city has identified its key problems and is moving towards finding solutions to these problems.
I am happy to note that the other five North Eastern cities of Guwahati, Aizawl Kohima, Imphal and Shillong are also moving in this direction.
Project implementation under the Smart Cities Mission is now gathering pace.
I am confident that we are fast progressing towards urban transformation of our North Eastern cities.
This will improve quality of life and boost economic development of the region.

Today is July 4, exactly 41 years since Operation Entebbe.
The day when your Prime Minister, and my friend, Bibi, lost his older brother Yoni, while saving the lives of so many Israeli hostages.
Your heroes are an inspiration for the younger generations.
India is a very old civilization but a young nation.
800 million people in India fall below 35 years of age.
The talented and skilled youth of India are also its driving force.
They propel my vision to transform India, its industry, its economy, its way of doing business, and its interface with the world.
In our path of sustained high growth and all around development, India counts Israel among its important partners.
The need to rely on science, technology, innovation, and higher technical education to overcome our developmental challenges is common to both of us.
These domains also bring together the creative energy and ideas of the highly skilled youth and entrepreneurs of the two countries.
Alongside building a partnership for shared economic prosperity, we are also cooperating to secure our societies against common threats such as terrorism.
A progressive partnership in all these areas would shape the scope of my conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today inaugurated a hospital in Dickoya in Central Province of Sri Lanka, built with Indian assistance.
During the address, the Prime Minister spoke of the contributions of the Indian Origin Tamil community to Sri Lanka, and the long shared heritage between India and Sri Lanka.
People the world over are familiar with famous Ceylon Tea that originates in this fertile land.
What is less known is that it is your sweat and toil that makes the Ceylon Tea the brew of choice for millions around the globe.
If Sri Lanka today is the third largest exporter of tea, it is because of your hard work.
You are that indispensable backbone of the thriving Sri Lankan tea industry that justly prides itself on its success and global reach today.
I for one truly appreciate your hard work.
You and I have something in common.
As some of you may have heard, I have a special association with tea.
Chai pe Charcha, or discussions over tea, is not just a slogan.
Rather, a mark of deep respect for the dignity and integrity of honest labour.
Today, we remember your forefathers.
Those men and women of strong will and courage, who undertook the journey of their life from India to then Ceylon.
Their journey may have been uphill and their struggles hard, but they never gave up.
You encountered the stiff challenge of making your own mark and identity in a newly independent nation.
But, you faced them boldly; you fought for your rights, but you did so peacefully.
We will never forget leaders like Saumiyamurthy Thondaman, who worked hard for your rights, for your upliftment and economic prosperity.
Kaniyan Pungunranar, a Tamil Scholar had declared more than two millennia ago, Yaathum Oore; Yavarum Kelir, meaning “Every town is hometown and all people are our kin”.
And, you have captured the true spirit of that saying.
You have made Sri Lanka your home.
You are an intrinsic part of the warp and the weft of the social fabric of this beautiful nation.
You are the children of Tamil Thai.
It is a matter of pride that many of you also speak Sinhala.
And, language is much more than a tool for communication.
It defines a culture, forges relationships, joins communities and acts as a strong unifying force.
There is no better sight than a multilingual society living in peace and harmony.
Hindu and Buddhist shrines were both respected and revered.
We need to strengthen, not separate, these threads of unity and harmony.
And, you are perhaps best placed to lead such efforts and make your contribution.
I come from the State of Gujarat in India, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi.
Almost 90 years ago, he visited this beautiful part of Sri Lanka, including Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Badulla, Bandarawela and Hatton.
Gandhiji’s first and only visit to Sri Lanka was about spreading the message of socio-economic development.
In commemoration of that historic visit, the Mahatma Gandhi International Centre was set up with Government of India assistance at Matale in 2015.
Another national icon of India from later years, Puratchi Thalaivar MGR was born on this very soil, establishing a life-long connection.
You form an important link between Indian and Sri Lankan people and government.
We see you as part of seamless continuum of our ties with this beautiful country.
It is my Government’s priority to nurture these links.
You have kept your bonds with India alive.
You have friends and relatives in India.
India beats in your hearts.
And, I am here to tell you that India fully reciprocates the warmth of your sentiment.
We are also upgrading a number of plantation schools.
Just a while ago, President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and I dedicated to the people a new 150-bed hospital complex in Dickoya, which has been constructed with Indian assistance.
I am also pleased to announce that we have decided to extend the 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service, currently in operation in Western and Southern Provinces, to all the other Provinces as well.
As we celebrate the International Day of Yoga next month, we look forward to your active participation in popularising its multiple benefits.
As part of the innovative Indian Housing Project in Sri Lanka, 4000 houses are being constructed in upcountry areas.
I am confident that it will be a bright future that matches the dreams and potential of your children and your heritage.

Implementation of the present MoU can be extended for further 5 year periods if neither of the Parties informs by written agreement of its intention to terminate it at least 6 months before the expiration of a given 5-year period.
This would be done by amending the decision of the Union Cabinet taken in its meeting held on 15.06.2016 for removal of difficulties experienced in effective implementation of this decision.
This will result in capacity building and leadership development of more Central Government doctors besides availability of more experienced doctors for medical education, clinical / patient care services and for implementation of national health programmes.

In order to tackle the problem of shortage of doctors, low joining and high attrition rate in Central Health Service, Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 15.06.2016, approved increase in age of superannuation of doctors of the Central Health Service to 65 years.
Subsequently, in its meeting held on 27.09.2017, the Union Cabinet increased age of superannuation of doctors working in various other Ministries/Departments including those of Indian Railways, AYUSH, Central Universities and NTs, etc. to 65 years.
It is, however, felt that there is a need to make available the services of senior doctors above the age of 62 years for core medical profession, such as, clinical / patient care/ teaching in medical colleges / implementation of health programmes, Public Health programmes & functions, etc.

Yesterday my Telugu sisters and brothers celebrated the festival of Bhogi.
Friends in the northern part of India, especially Punjab marked Lohri.
Today is Makar Sankranti.
In Gujarat, the sky is fully of kites on this day, which is also known as Uttarayan.
The people of Assam are celebrating Magh Bihu.
And in Tamil Nadu, where you are, it is Pongal.
Pongal is the festival of thankfulness – thanking the sun god, thanking the animals that help in agriculture and thanking nature for providing the natural resources that sustain us.
Harmony with nature is the strength of our culture, our traditions.
From north to south, east to west, we can see how there is a festive spirit across the nation.
Festivals are celebrations of life.
With festivals comes a spirit of togetherness.
They weave a beautiful thread of unity.
My greetings to people across India on all these festivals.
Makar Sankranti marks the transition of the Sun into the zodiac sign of Makara Rashi on its celestial path.
For most people, Makar Sankranti means a break from the harrowing winter and warmer, brighter days.
Some of the festivals we celebrate today are harvest festivals.
We pray that these festivals bring prosperity and joy in the lives of our farmers, who work hard to keep our nation fed.
I knew him personally for over four decades.
It is a personal loss for me.
He was one of the most multi-faceted personalities I have ever come across.
He was an actor, a director, a journalist, an editor, a writer, a playwright, a politician, a political commentator, a cultural critic, a highly talented writer, a religious and social critic, a lawyer and so much more.
Of all his roles, his role as the editor of the Thuglak magazine was the jewel in the crown.
For 47 years the Thuglak magazine played a stellar role in the cause of safeguarding democratic values and national interest.
Thuglak and Cho – it is difficult to imagine one without the other.
For nearly five decades, he was in charge of Thuglak.
If someone has to write the political history of India, he cannot write it without including Cho Ramaswamy and his political commentary.
It is easy to admire Cho, but it is not very easy to understand Cho.
To understand him, one needs to understand his courage, conviction, his sense of nationalism which went beyond parochial, regional, linguistic and other divisions.
His greatest achievement is that he made Thuglak a weapon against all divisive forces.
He was fighting for a clean and non-corrupt political system.
In that struggle, he never spared anyone.
He was critical of those people with whom he had acted for decades, critical of those people who were friends with him for decades, critical of those people who considered him as his mentor.
No one was spared.
He did not look at the personalities but looked at the issues.
The Nation was his central message.
This is reflected in his writings, in the movies, plays and television serials he directed, in the movies for which he wrote the screenplay.
His satire made his criticism loveable even to those he criticized.
That is a not a cultivated or cultivable virtue.
That was a gift from the divine to him, which he used only to promote public interest.
It was his gift also to communicate ideas in one cartoon or in one sentence which a book or volumes of books could not.
This reminds me of a cartoon by Cho wherein people are targeting me with their guns and the common people are standing in front of me; Cho asks who is the real target?
Me or the common people?
How apt is the cartoon in today’s context!
I am reminded of one incident related to Cho.
The pelters started laughing.
He had this incredible ability to mould conditions in his favour.
Thuglak was a platform for all.
Cho would carry views contrary, even hostile to him, and even abusive of him in his own magazine.
This made no one excluded in Thuglak.
Even those he criticized would find their views carried with the same prominence as Cho’s in Thuglak.
This is the truest democratic spirit in media and in public life.
In my opinion, his thought and contributions were not merely limited to Tamil milieu and Tamil people.
He inspired many generations of aspiring journalists and politicians spanning many societies in India.
And all of us know that Thuglak magazine was not a mere political commentary.
It was the ears and eyes of millions of Tamil people.
Cho, through Thuglak, was the connecting bridge between masses and rulers.
I am glad that Thuglak will continue its journey in objective journalism as envisaged by Cho.
Those who have inherited the legacy of Thuglak have great responsibility on their shoulders.
To be guided by Cho’s vision and commitment will be a big challenge.
Adherence to this vision will be a great service to the people of Tamil Nadu.
I wish Mr. Gurumurthy and his team all the very best in this endeavour.
Knowing Gurumurthy ji, I am confident that he will be successful.
That Cho had mastered the art of satire, humour and irony need not be overstated.
I think we need more satire and humour.
Humour brings happiness in our lives.
Humour is the best healer.
The power of a smile or the power of laughter is more than the power of abuse or any other weapon.
Humour builds bridges instead of breaking them.
And this is exactly what we require today- building bridges.
Bridges between people.
Bridges between communities.
Bridges between societies.
Humour brings out human creativity.
(The eternal does not move from place to place, but moves from one abode to another.)
Let us, together thank him for his contribution to the multiple fields he touched.
Above all let us thank him for being the great Cho Ramaswamy – the one and only Cho.
The Government equity would be Rs.1,000 crore.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Rajasva Gyan Sangam at New Delhi, and addressed the tax administrators of both the Union and State Governments.
The Prime Minister exhorted the officers to improve their work-culture, to incorporate both a “sense of urgency”, and “measurability”, in their performance.
Mentioning the benefits of the GST, the Prime Minister said that besides economic integration of the country, and transparency in the system; more than 17 lakh new traders have been brought into the indirect tax system within two months.
The Prime Minister said that in order to enable all traders to take maximum benefit of GST, we should work towards ensuring that all traders, including even relatively smaller traders with a turnover below Rs. 20 lakhs, should register with the GST system.
He asked the officers to make efforts in this regard by designing a system for this category.
He said that the Union Government is working towards creation of an environment which shatters the confidence of the corrupt, and instills confidence and trust among the honest taxpayer.
In this regard, he mentioned steps taken by the Union Government, such as demonetization, and implementation of stringent laws against black money and benami property.
The Prime Minister said human interface must be kept to a minimum in the tax administration’s dealings.
The Prime Minister asked officers to use data analytical tools to proactively track and determine undeclared income and wealth.
He said that though efforts to increase tax revenue are made by officers each year, the estimated amounts of tax that should accrue to the system, are often not realised.
In this regard he also suggested complete reworking of human resource management in the tax departments to strengthen the data analytics and investigation wing.
The Prime Minister hoped that the two-day Gyan Sangam would come up with concrete ideas to improve the tax administration.
Over Rs. 1200 crore will be given by the Union Government for the infrastructure sector alone.
Rs. 400 crore will be provided for improving the water holding capacity of the Brahmaputra River, which will assist in flood control.
In the current financial year, the Union Government has approved Rs. 600 crore as central share of SDRF.
The Union Government will also provide Rs. 100 crore for carrying out a study to synergize efforts towards finding time-bound long term solutions to recurrent floods in the region.
The North-Eastern region, with eight percent of India’s land area, contains one-third of the country’s water resources.
The Union Government will constitute a High Level Committee, with representation from Ministries of the Government of India and the States, for proper management of the region’s vast water resources.
An ex-gratia assistance of Rs. 2 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased, and Rs. 50,000/- to each of those seriously injured due to the floods, has been sanctioned under the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF).
He said that over decades, Shri Vajpayee’s voice remained the voice of the people.
As a speaker, he was unparalleled.
Shri Narendra Modi said that a long part of Shri Vajpayee’s career was spent in the opposition benches, but he always spoke about national interest.
He expressed confidence that Shri Vajpayee will continue to be an inspiration for all of us.
May this special day enhance the spirit of peace and prosperity in our society”.

“16-year old Saurabh Chaudhary illustrates the potential and prowess our youth is blessed with.
This exceptional youngster brings home a Gold in the Men’s 10m Air Pistol event at the Asian Games 2018.
Congratulations to him! “, the Prime Minister said.
Dr. Mookerjee is remembered as a fine educationist, a wonderful administrator and a stalwart who fought for India’s freedom as well as unity”, the Prime Minister said.
I am deeply honoured by the invitation to address this Joint Meeting of the U.S. Congress.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker for opening the doors of this magnificent Capitol.
This temple of democracy has encouraged and empowered other democracies the world over.
It manifests the spirit of this great nation, which in Abraham Lincoln’s words, “was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”
In granting me this opportunity, you have honoured the world’s largest democracy and its 1.25 billion people.
As a representative of world’s largest democracy, it is indeed a privilege to speak to the leaders of its oldest.
Mr. Speaker,
Two days ago, I began my visit by going to the Arlington National Cemetery -the final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land.
I honoured their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy.
It was also the seventy-second Anniversary of the D-Day.
On that day, thousands from this great country fought to protect the torch of liberty on the remote shores of a land that they did not know.
They sacrificed their lives so that the world lives in freedom.
I applaud …India applauds, the great sacrifices of the men and women from ‘The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave’ in service of mankind.
That is why the threads of freedom and liberty form a strong bond between our two democracies.
Mr. Speaker,
Our nations may have been shaped by differing histories, cultures, and faiths.
Yet, our belief in democracy for our nations and liberty for our countrymen is common.
The idea that all citizens are created equal is a central pillar of the American constitution.
Our founding fathers too shared the same belief and sought individual liberty for every citizen of India.
There were many who doubted India when, as a newly independent nation, we reposed our faith in democracy.
Indeed, wagers were made on our failure.
But, the people of India did not waver.
Our founders created a modern nation with freedom, democracy, and equality as the essence of its soul.
And, in doing so, they ensured that we continued to celebrate our age old diversity.
Today, across its streets and institutions, in its villages and cities, anchored in equal respect for all faiths; and in the melody of hundreds of its languages and dialects.
India lives as one; India grows as one; India celebrates as one.
Modern India is in its 70th year.
For my government, the Constitution is its real holy book.
And, in that holy book, freedom of faith, speech and franchise, and equality of all citizens, regardless of background, are enshrined as fundamental rights.
800 million of my countrymen may exercise the freedom of franchise once every five years.
Engagement between our democracies has been visible in the manner in which our thinkers impacted one another, and shaped the course of our societies.
Thoreau’s idea of civil disobedience influenced our political thoughts.
And, similarly the call by the great sage of India Swami Vivekananda to embrace humanity was most famously delivered in Chicago.
Gandhi’s non-violence inspired the heroism of Martin Luther King.
Today, a mere distance of 3 miles separates the Martin Luther King memorial at Tidal Basin from the statue of Gandhi at Massachusetts Avenue.
This proximity of their memorials in Washington mirrors the closeness of ideals and values they believed in.
Our independence was ignited by the same idealism that fuelled your struggle for freedom.
No wonder that the shared ideals and common philosophy of freedom shaped the bedrock of our ties.
No wonder then, that President Obama has called our ties the defining partnership of the 21st century.
The pages of our friendship since then tell a remarkable story.
Today, our relationship has overcome the hesitations of history.
Comfort, candour and convergence define our conversations.
Through the cycle of elections and transitions of Administrations the intensity of our engagements has only grown.
And, in this exciting journey, the U.S. Congress has acted as its compass.
And for this, we are grateful.
Time and again, I have also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament, especially in our Upper House.
So, as you can see, we have many shared practices.
As this country knows well, every journey has its pioneers.
Very early on, they shaped a development partnership even when the meeting ground was more limited.
The genius of Norman Borlaug brought the Green Revolution and food security to India.
The excellence of the American Universities nurtured Institutes of Technology and Management in India.
Our S&T collaboration continues to helps us in cracking the age-old problems in the fields of public health, education, food, and agriculture.
Ties of commerce and investment are flourishing.
We trade more with the U.S. than with any other nation.
And, the flow of goods, services and capital between us generates jobs in both our societies.
As in trade, so in defence.
India exercises with the United States more than we do with any other partner.
Defence purchases have moved from almost zero to ten billion dollars in less than a decade.
Our cooperation also secures our cities and citizens from terrorists, and protects our critical infrastructure from cyber threats.
They are your strength.
They are also the pride of India.
They symbolize the best of both our societies.
My understanding of your great country began long before I entered public office.
Long before assuming office, I travelled coast to coast, covering more than 25 States of America.
I realized then that the real strength of the U.S. was in the dreams of its people and the boldness of their ambitions.
Today, Mr. Speaker, a similar spirit animates India.
Our 800 million youth, especially, are particularly impatient.
India is undergoing a profound social and economic change.
A billion of its citizens are already politically empowered.
My dream is to economically empower them through many social and economic transformations.
And, do so by 2022, the seventy-fifth anniversary of India’s independence.
These are not just aspirations; they are goals to be reached in a finite time-frame.
And, to be achieved with a light carbon foot print, with greater emphasis on renewables.
In every sector of India’s forward march, I see the U.S. as an indispensable partner.
Many of you also believe that a stronger and prosperous India is in America’s strategic interest.
Let us work together to convert shared ideals into practical cooperation.
As the U.S. businesses search for new areas of economic growth, markets for their goods, a pool of skilled resources, and global locations to produce and manufacture, India could be their ideal partner.
India’s strong economy, and growth rate of 7.6% per annum, is creating new opportunities for our mutual prosperity.
Transformative American technologies in India and growing investment by Indian companies in the United States both have a positive impact on the lives of our citizens.
The 21st century has brought with it great opportunities.
But, it also comes with its own set of challenges.
Inter-dependence is increasing.
But, while some parts of the world are islands of growing economic prosperity; other are mired in conflicts.
In Asia, the absence of an agreed security architecture creates uncertainty.
And, global institutions conceived in 20th century, seem unable to cope with new challenges or take on new responsibilities.
India is already assuming her responsibilities in securing the Indian Ocean region.
It can also help ensure security of the sea lanes of commerce and freedom of navigation on seas.
But, the effectiveness of our cooperation would increase if international institutions framed with the mindset of the 20th century were to reflect the realities of today.
Before arriving in Washington D.C., I had visited Herat in Western Afghanistan to inaugurate Afghan-India Friendship Dam, a 42 MW hydro-electric project built with Indian assistance.
I was also there on the Christmas day last year to dedicate to that proud nation its Parliament, a testimony to our democratic ties.
Afghans naturally recognize that the sacrifices of American have helped create a better life.
But, your contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated even beyond.
India too has made an enormous contribution and sacrifices to support our friendship with Afghan people.
A commitment to rebuild a peaceful, and stable and prosperous Afghanistan our shared objective.
Yet, Distinguished Members, not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere in South Asia, and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat.
Although it’s shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India’s neighbourhood.
Refusing to reward them is the first step towards holding them accountable for their actions.
The fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels.
And, the traditional tools of military, intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight.
Terrorism must be delegitimized.
The benefits of our partnership extend not just to the nations and regions that need it most.
On our own, and by combining our capacities, we are also responding to other global challenges including when disaster strikes and where humanitarian relief is needed.
Far from our shores, we evacuated thousands from Yemen, Indians, Americans and others.
Often, India and the U.S. have combined their strengths in science, technology and innovation to help fight hunger, poverty, diseases and illiteracy in different parts of the world.
The success of our partnership is also opening up new opportunities for learning, security and development from Asia to Africa.
And, the protection of environment and caring for the planet is central to our shared vision of a just world.
For us in India, to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient belief.
And, to take from nature only what is most essential is part of our civilizational ethos.
Our partnership, therefore, aims to balance responsibilities with capabilities.
And, it also focuses on new ways to increase the availability and use of renewable energy.
A strong U.S. support for our initiative to form an International Solar Alliance is one such effort.
We are working together not just for a better future for ourselves, but for the whole world.
This has also been the goal of our efforts in G-20, East Asia Summit and Climate Change summits.
Mr. Speaker and Distinguished Members
As we deepen our partnership, there would be times when we would have differing perspectives.
But, since our interests and concerns converge, the autonomy in decision making and diversity in our perspectives can only add value to our partnership.
So, as we embark on a new journey, and seek new goals, let us focus not just on matters routine but transformational ideas.
Ideas which can focus:
And, important for the success of this journey would be a need to view it with new eyes and new sensitivities.
When we do this, we will realise the full promise of this extraordinary relationship.
My final thoughts and words would reiterate that our relationship is primed for a momentous future.
The constraints of the past are behind us and foundations of the future are firmly in place.
In the lines of Walt Whitman,
“The Orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments, the baton has given the signal.”
And to that, if I might add, there is a new symphony in play.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and Distinguished members for this honour.
He sought support from Apple in furthering these objectives.
Issues regarding cyber-security and data encryption also came up for discussion.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi congratulated Bharat Ratna Awardees.
PM praised Nanaji Deshmukh for his contribution to the society and said “Nanaji Deshmukh’s stellar contribution towards rural development showed the way for a new paradigm of empowering those living in our villages.
He personifies humility, compassion and service to the downtrodden.
He is a Bharat Ratna in the truest sense.”
From them radiates the message of Justice, harmony and brotherhood.
He has served the nation selflessly and tirelessly for decades, leaving a strong imprint on the nation’s growth trajectory.
His wisdom and intellect have few parallels.
Delighted that he has been conferred Bharat Ratna.”
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will join the programme to mark the conclusion of the Narmada Seva Yatra in Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh, tomorrow.
Tomorrow in Madhya Pradesh, I will be launching the Narmada Seva Mission, which will surely have a major impact on MP’s ecology.
You can watch tomorrow’s Narmada Seva Yatra programme live on your mobiles on https://t.co/TYuxNNJfIf”, the Prime Minister said.
In a series of tweets, the Prime Minister also said that it is heartening to see such warmth, enthusiasm and patience of the citizens to bear this limited inconvenience for a greater good.
He assured that the Government is unwavering in its effort to create an India which is corruption free and in ensuring that the fruits of development touch every citizen.
“So happy to learn that citizens are expressing their gratitude to bankers & getting notes exchanged in a very patient and orderly manner.
It is also heartening to learn that people are actively volunteering to help senior citizens withdraw money and exchange their currency.
Such warmth, enthusiasm and the patience to bear limited inconvenience for a greater good is indeed very heartening.
I assure you the Govt is unwavering in its effort to create an India that is corruption free & fruits of development touch every citizen “, the Prime Minister said.
“On his birth anniversary, my tributes to Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee.
We remember with pride his rich contribution towards India’s history”, the Prime Minister said.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Savitribai Phule on her Jayanti.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I welcome you all to New Delhi for this landmark conference, the first after the adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
I commend the national disaster risk management agencies, their governments in the Asia-Pacific region, the United Nations, and other stakeholders for coming together for this important cause.
Apart from the Sendai Framework, the international community adopted two other major frameworks to shape the future of humanity:
– the Sustainable Development Goals,
– and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
The spirit of inter-connectedness, highlighted in the film, is the hallmark of these global frameworks.
It is in this context that this conference becomes timely and relevant.
Over the last two decades, the world, and especially our region has undergone many changes – most of them positive.
Many countries in our region have transformed their economies and become engines of global economic growth.
Hundreds of millions of our people have been lifted out of poverty.
The Asia-Pacific region has been a global leader in more ways than one.
But we must not take this progress for granted.
There are challenges as well.
I have seen for myself the human suffering caused by disasters.
We in Asia have learnt from disasters.
A quarter century ago, only a handful of Asian nations had national disaster management institutions.
Today, over thirty Asian countries have dedicated institutions leading disaster risk management efforts.
It led to a significant reduction in loss of lives from cyclones.
The Asia-Pacific is rapidly urbanizing.
Perhaps within a decade more people in the region will live in cities than in villages.
Urbanization will pose greater challenges for disaster risk management, by concentrating people, property and economic activity in smaller areas, many of them in disaster prone locations.
This will ensure that all development projects – airports, roads, canals, hospitals, schools, bridges – are built to appropriate standards and contribute to the resilience of communities they seek to serve.
This is a smart strategy, which pays off in the long term.
All our public expenditure must take into account risk considerations.
In India, the ‘housing for all’ programme and ‘smart cities’ initiative represent such opportunities.
This will help generate new knowledge for hazard risk assessment, disaster resilient technologies and mechanisms for integrating risk reduction in infrastructure financing.
Second, work towards risk coverage for all – starting from poor households to small and medium enterprises to multi-national corporations to nation states.
States have an important role in not just regulating but also encouraging coverage for those who need it the most.
In India, we have taken bold steps to ensure financial inclusion and risk insurance for the poorest.
We have launched the Fasal Bima Yojana, which will provide risk cover to millions of farmers.
These are the basic building blocks of resilience at the household level.
Third, encourage greater involvement and leadership of women in disaster risk management.
Women are disproportionately affected by disasters.
We must train a large number of women volunteers to support special needs of women affected by disasters.
We need women engineers, masons and building artisans supporting reconstruction, and women self help groups assisting livelihood recovery.
For disaster risk related to other hazards such as chemical hazards, forest fires, cyclones, different types of floods, we need to evolve similar globally accepted risk categories.
This will help us ensure that we have a common understanding of the nature and severity of disaster risks in different parts of the world.
Fifth, leverage technology to enhance the efficiency of our disaster risk management efforts.
An e-platform that brings together organizations and individuals and helps them map and exchange expertise, technology and resources would go a long way in maximizing our collective impact.
Sixth, develop a network of universities to work on disaster issues.
After all, universities have social responsibilities too.
Over the first five years of the Sendai Framework, we should develop a global network of universities working together on problems of disaster risk management.
Universities located in coastal areas could specialize in managing risks from coastal hazards, and the ones located in the hill cities could focus on mountain hazards.
Seventh, utilize the opportunities provided by social media and mobile technologies.
We must recognize the potential of social media and develop applications for all aspects of disaster risk management.
Eighth, build on local capacity and initiative.
The task of disaster risk management, particularly in rapidly growing economies, is so huge that formal institutions of the state can at best be instrumental in creating the enabling conditions.
Over the last two decades, most community based efforts have been confined to disaster preparedness and contingency planning for the short term.
We need to expand the scope of community based efforts and support communities to identify local risk reduction measures and implement them.
Such efforts reduce risk and create opportunities for local development and sustainable livelihoods.
Localization of disaster risk reduction will also ensure that we make the most of traditional best practices and indigenous knowledge.
Response agencies need to interact with their communities, and make them familiar with the essential drill of disaster response.
Ninth, ensure that the opportunity to learn from a disaster is not wasted.
After every disaster there are papers and reports on lessons learnt that are rarely applied.
Often the same mistakes are repeated.
We need a more vibrant and visual system of learning.
The United Nations could start an international competition of documentary films that record disaster events, their scale, and relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery afterwards.
This collective strength and solidarity could be enhanced further if we work under a common umbrella.
The United Nations could think of a common logo and branding under which all those who are helping with relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction operate.
Armed Forces protect nation states against external security threats.
But to deal with disasters, we need to equip society with the right education.
I am sure, this conference will energize our efforts and the outcomes of the conference will provide a solid blueprint for collective action.
i. Both the countries to facilitate training/study tour of personnel in the field of mass media and public relations.
ii. Encouraging the exchange of experts in the field of Mass Media
iii. Encourage cooperation between educational, training and research institutions in the field of Mass Media & Communication.
Also facilitating exchange of publications generated by these institutions.

Mr Scheer shared his perspective on further developing friendly relations between the two countries.
I have directed that Rs. 1000 crores be released immediately by Government of India to Tamil Nadu for immediate relief.
He praised the event saying “Usually, we get to see such big business Summit only abroad.
Now vibrant Gujarat as well as the start of Ahmedabad shopping Festival, is a commendable initiative”.
We are moving towards the system when the banks can give credit to small entrepreneurs on the basis of GST and other returns.
Earlier today, the PM inaugurated the Vibrant Gujarat Global Trade Showat the Mahatma Mandir Exhibition cum Convention Center in Gandhinagar.
With this, the stage is set for 9th edition of Vibrant Gujarat Summit,scheduled to be held during January 18-20in Gandhinagar.
Glad to see such widespread support for the Bill.
The House also witnessed a vibrant debate, where several members expressed their insightful opinions.
By passing The Constitution (One Hundred And Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019, we pay tributes to the makers of our Constitution and the great freedom fighters, who envisioned an India that is strong and inclusive”, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister welcomed the intensive exchange of high level visits between India and China over the last two years, and said that such visits contribute to building strategic understanding between the two countries.
Last session was a witness to a major decision on GST and the parliament made a major contribution towards realizing the dream of One nation, one tax.
We will talk about the issues pertaining to the needs and the aspirations of the people.
From the Government side, we will strive our level best to accomplish the transaction of business carrying all the political parties together.
In order to carry forward the work on GST, we have held discussions with the state Government and the political parties.
The consultation process has been going on ahead of this session as well.
Captains of Business and Industry,
Ladies & Gentlemen,
I welcome you all to World Food India 2017.
This event will provide you a glimpse of the opportunities that await you, in India.
It will showcase our potential in the food processing value chain.
It will provide a platform to connect with various stakeholders, and collaborate for mutual prosperity.
And, it will present to you, some of our most delightful cuisine, which has stimulated taste buds across the world.
Ladies and gentlemen.
India’s strengths in agriculture, are many and diverse.
Our horticulture sector has shown an average growth rate of 5.5 per cent annually over the last ten years.
For centuries, India has welcomed traders from distant lands, who came in search of our distinctive spices.
Their travels to India, often shaped the course of history.
It has been practiced for ages, even in the humblest of households.
Simple, home-based techniques, such as fermentation, have resulted in the creation of our famous pickles, papads, chutneys and murabbas that now excite both the elite and the masses, across the world.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Let us turn, for a while, to the big picture.
India is today one of the fastest growing economies of the world.
The Goods and Services Tax, or GST, has eliminated the multiplicity of taxes.
India has jumped thirty ranks this year, in the World Bank Doing Business rankings.
This is the highest ever improvement for India, and the highest jump for any country this year.
From a rank of 142 in 2014, we have now reached the top 100.
India was ranked number one in the world in 2016 in greenfield investment.
Archaic laws have been repealed, and the burden of compliances has been reduced.
It is a priority sector in our “Make in India” programme.
100% FDI, is now permitted, for trading, including through e-commerce, of food products manufactured or produced in India.
Private sector participation has been increasing in many segments of the value chain.
However, more investment is required in contract farming, raw material sourcing and creating agri linkages.
Many international companies in India have taken a lead in contract farming initiatives.
This is a clear opportunity for global super-market chains considering India as a major outsourcing hub.
On one hand, there are opportunities in post-harvest management, like primary processing and storage, preservation infrastructure, cold chain, and refrigerated transportation.
On the other hand, there is immense potential for food processing and value addition, especially in niche areas such as organic and fortified foods.
Increasing urbanization, and a growing middle class, are resulting in an ever-growing demand for wholesome, processed food.
Each one of them, is a potential customer for the food processing industry.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Lifestyle disease is raising consciousness globally, about the nature and quality of food consumption.
There is a growing aversion to the use of artificial colours, chemicals and preservatives.
India can provide solutions, and offer a win-win partnership.
The combination of traditional Indian food, with modern technology, processing and packaging, can help the world rediscover the health benefits, and refreshing taste of Indian food ingredients such as turmeric, ginger, and tulsi, to name just a few.
The perfect blend of hygienic, nutritious and tasty processed food, with the added benefits of preventive healthcare, can be produced economically, here in India.
The harmonization of the food additives standards with Codex, and the building of robust testing and laboratory infrastructure, will go a long way in creating an enabling environment for food businesses.
The farmers, whom we respectfully call our “Annadaata” or the providers of food are central to our efforts in food processing.
The creation of Mega Food Parks is a key component of this scheme.
This will offer immense value proposition in crops such as potato, pineapple, oranges and apples.
Farmer groups are being encouraged to set up units in these parks, thereby reducing wastage and transportation costs, and creating new jobs.
We plan to link our villages through broadband connectivity, within a clear timeframe.
We are digitising land records, and providing various services to the people on mobile platforms.
These steps are building momentum towards real-time transfer of information, knowledge and skills to farmers.
Many States have come up with attractive food processing policies to attract investment.
I urge each State of India to identify at least one food product for specialisation.
Similarly, each district can also select some food items for production, and one item for specialisation.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Today, our strong agricultural base provides us a solid launch pad to create a vibrant food processing sector.
Our vast consumer base, rising incomes, favourable investment climate and a Government dedicated to ease of doing business, all make India ‘the place to be’ for the global food processing fraternity.
Each sub sector of the food industry in India offers immense opportunity.
Let me give you some illustrations.
The dairy sector has emerged as a vital area for the rural economy.
We now aim to take this to the next level by increasing production levels of multiple products based on milk.
It offers several valuable by-products, such as bee wax.
It has the potential to increase farm incomes.
Our focus is on development of untapped areas, such as ornamental fisheries and trout farming.
We also wish to explore new areas, like pearl farming.
Our commitment to sustainable development, is at the heart of our thrust for organic farming.
Sikkim, in north-eastern India, has become India’s first fully organic state.
The entire north-east offers opportunities to create functional infrastructure for organic produce.
In order to be successful in Indian markets, understanding Indian food habits and tastes is a key requirement.
To give you just one example, milk based products and fruit-juice based drinks are an intrinsic part of Indian food habits.
That is why, I have been suggesting to manufacturers of aerated drinks, the potential of blending five per cent fruit juice in their products.
Food processing also holds solutions to nutrition security.
For example, our coarse grains and millets have high nutritional value.
Can we take up a venture based on these?
This will raise incomes of some of the poorest of our farmers, and also enhance our nutrition levels.
Such products, shall, of course, find resonance across the world.
Can we link our potential, to the world’s requirements?
Can we link Indian traditions with the future of mankind?
Can we connect India’s farmers with markets around the world?
It will also provide valuable insights into our rich culinary landscape, and highlight our ancient wisdom of food processing.
I am also happy to note that the Department of Post has released a set of twenty four commemorative postage stamps on this occasion, to illustrate the diversity of Indian cuisine.
I invite each one of you to become a part of the exciting growth journey of India’s food processing sector.
I assure you of my whole-hearted support, whenever required.
The place with unlimited opportunity from farm to fork.
The place to produce, process, and prosper.
For India, and for the world.
Based on inputs from all corners of the country, irrespective of the ruling party there, we found that we had to give a thought to finding not only permanent solutions but also devising practical ways and means to deal with this long-standing problem.
In a way, It was a kind of a learning experience too for me.
We not only pick it up but also pray five times for God’s forgiveness.
Our farmer brothers in Telangana, through ‘Mission Bhagirathi’ have made a commendable effort to optimally use the waters of Godavari and Krishna rivers.
‘Jal Yukt Shivir’ is one such people’s movement which is really going to be of great help in saving Maharashtra from water crisis in the future- this is what I feel.
Chhattisgarh has started the ‘Lok-Suraj, Jal-Suraj’ campaign.
In Uttar Pradesh there is ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Bachao Abhiyaan’.
In Karnataka water conservation efforts are in the form of ‘Kalyani Yojana’, under which they are trying to revive wells once again.
In Rajasthan and Gujarat there are many ancient baodis – deep tanks or masonry wells with steps going down to the water.
These states are making a very big effort to revive these as ‘water temples’.
Rajasthan has started the Chief Minister’s Jal Swawalamban Abhiyan – Water Self Sufficiency Campaign.
They have launched a very big campaign for building ‘Check Dams’.
If you wanted vegetables you could give wheat in return.
On the other hand, they have also got their Aadhar numbers.
And the mobile phone has reached the hands of almost every Indian.
So Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – Jam – J. A. M. Synchronising these three, we can move ahead towards a cashless society.
One of the initiatives in this regard taken by the Government of India is about how to make payments through ‘Pos’, how to receive money.
The ‘Universal Payment Interface’ banking transaction- UPI will change the way things work.
And I’m happy to tell you that the N.P.C.I. and banks are working together to launch this platform through a mobile app.
Across the country, nearly 1.25 lakh young people have been recruited as banking correspondents.
Shri Sarbanandji himself was leading the campaign.
Gaurav Patel says that Sir, afte securing 89.33% marks when I reached home, I was thinking that I would be congratulated by my family and friends, I would be applauded.
So it seems that my family, my friends, my teachers, nobody was pleased with my 89.33% marks.
Now I’m perplexed and don’t know how to handle the situation.
Was what I did not good enough?
Did I not prove myself?
It would have been better if your family members, your class mates and your friends had appreciated your 89.33%.
Possibilities of newer successes will arise out of success achieved earlier.
Why can’t we lead life in such a way that we don’t ever fall sick and no financial burden falls upon the family.
Prevention is better than cure.
You will remember it, won’t you?

Deepak Lather became the youngest Indian weightlifter to claim a Commonwealth Games medal, clinching a bronze in the men’s 69kg category at Gold Coast.
The move will be helpful in bringing uniformity in Judicial Service.
It will also help overcome the difficulties being faced by the litigants in travelling to Mumbai for filing appeals due to existing limited pecuniary jurisdiction.
Enhanced pecuniary jurisdiction will accelerate the justice delivery system, besides making access easier for litigants without having to travel outside the Union Territory.
Amir Khusro has written:
At the outset, I express my gratitude to lakhs of citizens of our country for sending in a multitude of suggestions when I ask for them before ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
On the NarendraModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, by post – I thank all of you for that.
If we try to take a bird’s eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress, we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination.
All Sciences develop and are built up through experience”.
Revered Bapu had also remarked, “I have nothing but praise for the zeal, industry and sacrifice that have animated the modern scientists in the pursuit after truth”.
Recently, during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, Niti Aayog and India’s Foreign Ministry had organized a unique competition.
It is a simple mobile App.
But it is so powerful that when a fisherman goes to sea for fishing, this App is able to provide guidance for direction to locate the most productive fishing zones and also provide multifarious types of information such as the direction and speed of the wind, the height of waves and so on.
This whole array of information is available on this mobile App which can be utilised by our fishermen brethren for moving to those areas with maximum fish presence in a very short time and thus earning their livelihood.
It is a delight to learn that till now, under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, ten lakh people have been rewarded, over fifty thousand traders have won prizes and an amount of almost over a hundred & fifty crores rupees has been earned as prize money by people who have promoted and carried forward this great campaign.
You know that this scheme will complete its 100 days on 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, a truly memorable day.

The securities market and insurance sector are growing rapidly.
With increase in the volume of trading in securities market, and clients in the insurance sector, it is likely that the grievances will also increase.

Distinguished Guests from India and abroad Delegates Ladies and Gentlemen
I am very happy to address you at this charity dinner at the International Diamond Conference.
This conference is part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council of India.
The conference on the theme of “Mines to Market 2017”, brings together miners, diamond companies, experts, retailers, bankers and analysts from across the globe.
As you all know, India is now the world’s largest manufacturer of cut and polished diamonds.
The gems and jewellery sector is one of the leading sectors in India in terms of value of exports as well as employment generation.
In the last four decades, India has emerged as the leader in diamond manufacturing and export.
Exports of gems and jewellery from India account for fifteen percent of India’s total merchandise exports.
This is one of India’s success stories.
From just twenty eight million dollars in 1966-67, exports reached one billion dollars in 1982-83 and two billion dollars in 1987-88.
It crossed ten billion dollars in 2003-04, twenty billion dollars in 2007-08 and is now nearly forty billion dollars.
This reduced the efficiency of the supply chain.
Many of you wanted us to enable viewing and trading to happen in India.
In December, 2014 at the World Diamond Conference held in Delhi, I had announced in the presence of the Russian President that we would set up a Special Notified Zone to achieve this.
This promise has been kept.
Amendments have been made to our laws to enable rough diamonds to enter and exit, duty free for the purpose of viewing.
Ladies and Gentlemen, our goal is to transform India in one generation.
Since taking office, this government has placed emphasis on many transformative initiatives.
‘Make in India’ is one of them.
Our aim is to make India a preferred destination for manufacturing.
In the last fifty years, the gems and jewellery sector has accounted for four hundred and seventy five billion dollars of exports.
This is despite the fact that India has little diamond or gold production.
Another important initiative is Skill India.
India cherishes its excellent relations with Africa.
Our shared post-colonial heritage and the similarity of the challenges we face, make us natural partners.
I take this opportunity to assure my friends from Africa that India will be happy to support them in developing their gems and jewellery sector, and in training their technicians.
I began by saying that this sector has come a long way from where it was.
However it is still far behind where it should be.
Our strongest area is diamond cutting and polishing.
In terms of the global value in the gems and jewellery market, our share is lower than it should be.
This means that India is a follower of global fashion rather than a leader of global taste.
Let me give an example.
Can’t our jewellers, with their skills, strengths and heritage, create and change global tastes and fashions?
The industry collectively needs to study and understand the end-users and what they want: for example, some areas and some groups may prefer gold, others silver and yet others platinum.
The basic point is that we cannot be world leaders without first connecting strongly with the client.
E-commerce makes it much easier to establish direct contact with the end-user.
This is a golden opportunity for the Indian industry.
Today, India has acquired a global brand for high skills and excellence in software.
We are yet to do that in jewellery.
If we do that, the potential is huge.
This is a task which the Council should take up in right earnest.
But the states also have a role to play.
Since taking office, we have encouraged state governments to take an active role in export promotion.
Apart from exports, India as the fastest growing economy in the world will also see increased domestic demand.
It is important for the industry to plan its growth.
But that is not enough.
It is also necessary for you to think of the weakest among you.
The accident insurance cost is about a rupee a month and the life insurance costs about a rupee a day.
A bank deposit of approximately five thousand rupees would earn enough interest to pay these premia permanently.
What can you do for the country by then?
Where do you think the industry should be by then?
How will you get there?
How many new jobs can you create?
I call upon you to give this a serious thought and come up with a plan.
If changes are needed in regulations, I ask you to come up, with specific and practical suggestions.
I conclude by thanking you for this opportunity to share my thoughts.
I wish the conference all success.
Last year on 3rd October I had an opportunity to conduct my first ever “Mann Ki Baat”.
“Mann Ki Baat” – one year, many thoughts.
These lakhs of letters did teach me something more.
I became aware of very minute problems associated with governance.
I would like to congratulate Akashwani for not treating these suggestions as mere bits of paper but considered them as expectations of the people.
They tried to get certain problems resolved.
Who would have thought that the “Mann Ki Baat” will become a source of information?
In the same way “Mann Ki Baat” became a platform to express the power of society.
Lakhs of people, perhaps from all the countries of the world posted a selfie with their daughters.
What dignity did it lend to our daughters?
Anyone who clicked this selfie not only boosted their daughter’s confidence but also made a commitment to them.
Isn’t it the need of the hour that there be Khadi for fashion?
Once I had mentioned in “Mann Ki Baat” about the problem of poor families, how their children cry due to the pollution when the wooden stove are lit.
Shouldn’t they be getting gas cylinders?
Isn’t it a demonstration of the people’s power?
Can there be a bigger satisfaction than this?
Please hear what he wants to say-
I want to give the message to Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi ji to request all the people of India through his programme “Mann Ki Baat” to use as much earthen lamps (diya) as they can this Diwali.
So the earthen lamps will be valuable too.
It is important from environmental point of view and it is made in a poor man’s home.
Poor people earn their living this way.
I request the citizens to follow Pawan’s advice in the coming festivals.
If we do so then the lamp may well be lit not only in our homes but it will illuminate the house of the poor.
To commemorate this event an exhibition named “Shouryanjali” had been organized near India Gate.
The entire history has been brought to life.
This exhibition on valour and gallantry helps us to experience our past.
It gives us knowledge about our history.
And this is an opportunity to inspire people to sow seeds for creating a new history.
“Prime Minister, Modi ji, I want to tell you that, for the Swachhta Abhiyan (Cleaniness Drive) that you started, you should get dustbins installed in every street and every corner”.
I got great satisfaction from this child’s message.
I even have to listen to a lot of things; people say things like “Modi ji used to talk big about cleanliness, but what really happened?”
I don’t get offended by all this.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say?
He once said, “if I have to choose between freedom and cleanliness, I will choose cleanliness first and freedom later”.
You pick any date; you will certainly find a name of one or the other great personality from the kaleidoscope of history.
I just have this small request, I do not insist that you only wear Khadi.
But have a few collection…. this is my only request.
I got the opportunity to spend quality time with Subhash Babu’s family members.
That day I decided to invite his great family to the Prime Minister’s residence.
Mr. Chandra Bose and his family members were in the process of organising this and last week I received the confirmation that around 50 members of the Bose family are coming to the Prime Minister’s residence for a meeting.
Netaji’s family members, probably, must have been invited together to the Prime Minister’s residence for the first time.
“My name is Bhargavi Kande.
He was an amazing kid.
They said, “We do not have any idea.”
Her father then told me that if she picks up mathematics once, she has everything memorized by the evening.
I noticed that a few people get a lot of work for me in ‘Mann Ki Baat.’
We shall meet next month again for ‘Mann Ki Baat.’
The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has, in principle, approved the inclusion of the communities, namely, ‘Parivara and Talawara’ as synonym of “Nayaka’ at SI.

Any subsequent inclusion in or exclusion from and other modifications in the list of Scheduled Tribes can be made only through an amending Act of Parliament.
Subjects such as education, skill development, art and culture and women’s safety also came up for discussion.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Myanmar on upgradation of the Women’s Police Training Centre at Yamethin, Myanmar.
The MoU was signed on 6th September, 2017.
The MoU covers upgradation of the Yamethin Women’s Police Training Centre to further augment the capabilities of the Myanmar Government to build capacities of its police force with technical and financial assistance from Government of India.
Pranaam Amma
Respected Dignitaries on the Dais
On this pious and sacred occasion, I offer my deep regards to Amma.
Not only that, she has become the synonym of life for many devotees.
Like a real Maa, she nurtures her devotees through direct and indirect acts; visible and invisible hands.
I am very fortunate to be among those who have been receiving Amma’s blessings and unconditional love.
Three years ago, I had the opportunity to be present at Amritapuri, to pay my respects on the occasion of Amma’s 60th birthday celebrations.
India is the land of such saints who have seen God in everything that can be seen.
Mankind is prominent among those things.
That is why service to mankind has become their main motto.
I am aware that even in her childhood Amma was fond of giving her own food to others.
Serving the old and the aged, and helping the needy have been her childhood passions.
Also, she used to worship Lord Krishna in her childhood.
These two qualities have been her strength.
Millions of devotees from all over the world also believe in the same.
I am aware of the social and charitable works done by various institutions and programmes run by Amma.
I would like to particularly mention the works done and donations made in the field of sanitation, water, housing, education and health.
I understand that some of those beneficiaries will get their certificates today.
Particularly, Amma’s initiative on building toilets has been a great help in our Swachh Bharat Programme.
Amma has pledged to contribute one hundred crore rupees towards sanitation efforts in Kerala.
This pledge includes the construction of fifteen thousand toilets for the poor.
Today, I am informed that throughout the State, Amma’s ashram has already completed construction of two thousand toilets.
I know that this is just one example of various works being done in the fields of environmental conservation and sustainability.
One year ago, Amma generously donated one hundred crore rupees to the Namami Gange programme.
I am also aware of Amma’s helping hands to mitigate the sufferings in the aftermath of natural disasters.
It is also heartening to note that the Researchers at Amrita University are innovating new approaches to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems.
At the end, I would like to convey my sincere thanks for giving me the opportunity of joining the celebrations.
Once again I express my deep regards to Amma.
The Agreement will be beneficial for the citizens of both the countries.
Ties of India and African countries are from pre-independence era.
India and Morocco have enjoyed cordial and friendly relations and over the years bilateral relations have witnessed significant depth and growth.
Both nations are part of the Non-Aligned Movement.
In the United Nations, India supported the decolonization of Morocco and the Moroccan freedom movement.

The objective of FCTC is to provide a framework for supply and demand reduction measures for tobacco control at the national, regional and global levels.
One of the key tobacco supply reduction strategies contained in Article 15 of WHO FCTC envisages elimination of all forms of illicit trade and tobacco products, including smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting.
Accordingly, the said Protocol was developed and adopted by the Conference of Parties (COP) which is the governing body of FCTC.
The protocol is divided into 10 parts and contains 47 Articles.

At the outset, I apologise for the delay due to logistical reasons.
I am delighted to welcome you all to PETROTECH-2019, the thirteenth edition of India’s flagship hydrocarbon Conference.
I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Dr. Sultan Al Jaber for his contribution to the energy sector and vision for the future.
Over the last quarter century, PETROTECH has served as a platform to discuss solutions to challenges that we face in the energy sector.
In each of our respective countries, we seek to deliver affordable, efficient, clean and assured energy supplies to our citizens.
The presence of over sixty countries and seven thousand delegates here, is a reflection of that common quest.
Several decades of public life have convinced me that energy is a key driver of socio-economic growth.
Suitably priced, stable and sustainable energy supply, is essential for rapid growth of the economy.
It also helps the poor and deprived sections of society, to partake of economic benefits.
At the macro level, the energy sector is a pivot and key enabler of growth.
As we gather here to discuss the present and future of global energy, winds of change are evident in the global energy arena.
There is a shift in energy consumption from West to East.
The United States has become the world’s largest oil and gas producer after the shale revolution.
Solar energy and other renewable sources of energy have become more competitive.
They are emerging as sustainable substitutes for traditional energy forms.
Natural Gas is fast becoming one of the largest fuels in the global energy mix.
There are signs of convergence, between cheaper renewable energy, technologies, and digital applications.
This may expedite the achievement of many sustainable development goals.
Nations are coming together to tackle climate change.
This is visible in global partnerships, such as the International Solar Alliance, promoted by India and France.
We are entering an era of greater energy availability.
Many more do not have access to clean cooking fuel.
India has taken a lead in addressing these issues of energy access.
In our success, I see hope for the world that problems of energy availability can be suitably addressed.
People must have universal access to clean, affordable, sustainable and equitable supply of energy.
India’s contribution in the onset of an era based on energy justice is significant.
Currently, India is the fastest growing large economy in the world.
Leading agencies such as IMF and World Bank, project the same trend to continue in the coming years.
In an uncertain global economic environment, India has shown tremendous resilience as an anchor of the world economy.
India recently became the sixth largest economy in the world.
According to a recent report, by 2030, India could be the second largest world economy.
We are also the third largest energy consumer in the world, with demand growing at more than five percent annually.
India remains an attractive market for energy companies with energy demand expected to more than double by 2040.
We have adopted an integrated approach towards energy planning.
During the last PETROTECH Conference in December 2016, I mentioned four pillars for India’s energy future.
These are energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security.
Energy justice is also a key objective for me, and a top priority for India.
Towards this end, we have developed and implemented many policies.
Electricity has reached all our rural areas.
This year we aim to achieve hundred per cent electrification of households in India, through a targeted programme called SAUBHAGYA.
As we raise production, we also aim to reduce losses in transmission and distribution.
Under our UDAY scheme, we are working towards this objective.
India’s World Bank Ease of Getting Electricity Ranking, improved from one hundred and eleven in 2014 to twenty-nine in 2018.
LED bulbs distributed across the country under the UJALA scheme, have resulted in an annual saving of seventeen thousand crore rupees, or nearly 2.5 billion dollars.
Access to clean cooking fuel provides major benefits, especially to women and children at risk of exposure to smoke pollution.
LPG connections have been given to over sixty four million or 6.4 crore households in just under three years under the Ujjwala Scheme.
A ‘Blue Flame Revolution’ is underway.
LPG coverage has reached more than ninety percent, from fifty-five percent five years ago.
Clean Transportation is getting a boost.
This is the equivalent of EURO six standards.
Achievements such as hundred percent electrification, and increased LPG coverage, are possible only through people’s involvement.
Energy justice can be done only when people believe in their collective power.
Government is only an enabler in converting that belief into a reality.
The last five years have seen major reforms in India’s oil and gas sector.
We have revamped our upstream policies and regulations.
We have launched the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy to bring transparency and competitiveness in the sector.
The bidding criterion has been changed to revenue sharing.
This has helped reduce government intervention.
An Open Acreage Licensing Policy and a National Data Repository is helping to increase exploration interest in Indian fields.
Gas pricing reforms have also been introduced.
The Enhanced Oil Recovery Policy aims to promote the use of latest technology in improving productivity of upstream fields.
Our downstream sector has been completely liberalized.
Market driven petrol and diesel prices reflect changes in the international price of crude oil.
India has the fourth largest refining capacity in the world.
This will further grow by about 200 million metric tons by 2030.
A National Biofuel Policy was enacted last year.
Research on second and third generation biofuels is being promoted.
Twelve second generation bio-refineries are being set up in eleven states.
The ethanol blending and biodiesel programme is reducing carbon emissions, and raising farmers’ incomes.
Bio Aviation Turbine Fuel has already been tried out in our civil aviation sector.
Our government has encouraged private participation across the entire oil and gas value chain.
India is becoming an attractive FDI destination.
Companies like Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, TOTAL, Exxon-Mobil, BP and Shell are looking to increase their investments across the value chain.
India is making rapid strides towards a gas based economy.
Execution of three thousand, two hundred kilometers of gas pipeline in Eastern India has begun.
This will connect North East India with the National Gas Grid.
The tenth bid round for City Gas Distribution will be complete in a month’s time.
This will cover over four hundred districts.
It will extend coverage of City Gas Distribution to seventy percent of our population.
We are gearing up for Industry 4.0.
This will change the way industry operates, with new technology and processes.
Our companies are adopting latest technologies to improve efficiency, increase safety and reduce costs.
This is being done in downstream retail, as well as in upstream oil and gas production, asset maintenance and remote monitoring.
In recent years, we have deepened our international engagement with organizations such as the International Energy Agency, and OPEC.
We chaired the International Energy Forum from 2016 to 2018.
We have been able to convert our traditional buyer-seller engagements into strategic partnerships through bilateral investments.
We have also promoted our ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy by strengthening energy engagement with Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Myanmar.
I have regularly engaged with global CEOs from the oil and gas sector.
In my interactions with world leaders and CEOs, I have always maintained that Oil and Gas are not only a commodity of trade but also of necessity.
Whether it is for the kitchen of a common man or for an aircraft, energy is essential.
For too long, the world has seen crude prices on a roller-coaster.
We need to move to responsible pricing, which balances the interests of both the producer and consumer.
Only then can we serve the energy needs of humanity in an optimal manner.
Another key issue that needs the world to come together is climate change.
Together, we can achieve the targets we set for ourselves at COP-21 in Paris.
India has made rapid strides in meeting its commitment.
We are on our way to reaching the target.
PETROTECH provides the perfect setting to ponder over the future of the energy sector.
It is a good platform to reflect on how global shifts, transitions, policies and new technologies will influence market stability and future investments in the sector.
I wish you all a successful and fruitful Conference.
This event is being held in India for the first time.
It has been organized in partnership with NASSCOM, WITSA and the Government of Telangana.
I am happy, however, that the power of IT enables me to address you remotely.
On the side-lines of this conference, I hope you shall have some time to explore the vibrant history, and delectable cuisine of Hyderabad.
I am sure, it shall encourage you to visit other parts of India as well.
Indeed, India is home to ancient, rich and diverse cultures, through which runs an under-lying theme of unity.
It reflects our inclusive traditions.
IN the twenty-first century, technology is becoming an enabler or this concept.
It helps us create a seam-less, integrated world.
A world where geographical distance no longer remains a barrier in collaborating for a better future.
Today, India is the hot-spot of digital innovation, across all sectors.
We not only have a growing number of innovative entrepreneurs, but also a growing market for tech innovation.
We were and we remain one of the most tech friendly populations in the world.
With over one lakh villages linked with optical fiber, 121 crore Mobile phones, 120 crore Adjara and 50 crore internet users,
India is best placed to leverage the power of technology and leap-frog into the future while ensuring empowerment of every citizen.
Digital India is a journey bringing about digital inclusion for digital empowerment aided by digital infrastructure for digital delivery of services.
Leveraging technology in such a holistic manner was unthinkable some years ago.
We have successfully completed this life-cycle in the last 3 and a half years.
This has been possible through a change in public behavior and processes.
Digital India has not remained merely a Government initiative, but has become a way of life.
Technology has transcended power-point presentations and has become an inseparable part of people’s lives.
While most Government initiatives depend on a Government push, Digital India is succeeding because of the people’s pull.
Around 22 million digital hospital transactions across 172 hospitals in India are bringing comfort in the lives of patients.
The National Scholarship Portal for easy Scholarships today has 14 million students registered on it.
Digital payments through BHIM-UPI has registered transactions of Rupees fifteen thousand Crore in January 2018.
The unique Umang app launched only three months back is already offering 185 Government services.
Today 2.8 lakh Common Services Centers are there in different parts of the country giving many digital services to people.
About 10 lakh people work in these centers, including thousands of women entrepreneurs.
Under this10 million people have already been trained.
Government e-Market-place has been developed as the National Procurement Portal of India.
It enables small and medium enterprises to compete in meeting the procurement requirements of the Government.
This simple IT framework has improved transparency in Government procurement.
It has also speeded up procurement processes, and empowered thousands of small and medium enterprises.
Yesterday, at Mumbai University, I had the opportunity to dedicate to the nation, the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
This is an independent, non-profit research institute, with a mission of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good.
A few days ago, in Dubai, at the World Government Summit, I had the opportunity to visit an exhibition on the “Museum of the Future.”
This has been planned as an incubator for ideas, and a driver for innovation.
I appreciate the pioneers of technology, some of whom are in the audience today, for the work they are doing.
They are helping to secure a better, more comfortable future for humanity.
We stand today, at the cusp of the fourth Industrial Revolution.
Technology, if used well for public good, can deliver lasting prosperity to mankind and a sustainable future for our planet.
It is in this context, that I place the World Conference on Information Technology, in India today.
The key themes at this Conference, reflect the opportunities that await us.
Disruptive technologies such as Block-chain and the Internet of Things, will have a deep impact in the way we live and work.
They will require rapid adaptation in our workplaces.
Skilling citizens for the workplace of the future is Important.
In India, we have launched the National Skill Development Mission to prepare our children and youth for a bright future.
We also need to ensure that our existing work-forces able to re-skill, as new technologies emerge.
One of the invited speakers at this event, the robot Sophia shows the potential of new technologies.
We need to reflect on the changing nature of jobs, in the emerging age of intelligent automation .I compliment NASSCOM for developing the “Skills of the Future” platform.
I am told, NASSCOM has identified eight important technologies.
NASSCOM has also identified fifty-five job roles that are going to be in high demand globally.
I am sure, the “skills of future” platform will greatly help India maintain its competitive edge.
Digital technology is now at the heart of every business.
New technologies must be embedded in various operations and processes of a business entity.
How can we prepare our millions of small and medium businesses for this transformation, in a short time?
Keeping in mind the importance of innovation, in the future of economy and business, the Government of India has launched the Start-up India initiative.
We believe our startups are the key to finding viable and economical solutions across sectors and verticals.
Under the Atal Innovation Mission, we are building Atal Tinkering Labs in schools across India.
The objective of this scheme is to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am sure, that as you deliberate on various themes of Information Technology, you shall keep the interests of the common man at the back of your mind.
I once again welcome the distinguished delegates from across the world, to India.
May your deliberations be productive?
May the outcomes benefit the poor and the under-privileged across the world?
However, the past two weeks have been the harbinger of the welcome news of rainfall from different places, bringing in its wake a feeling of freshness.
You too must have felt it.
This news in itself charges us with a lot of enthusiasm.
I extend my greetings to all our farmer brethren hoping for a bountiful rainfall.
In our country, like the toiling farmers, our scientists are also achieving success on many fronts to take our country to new heights.
I also want to share another bright news with you.
Over there I met those students of the Pune College of Engineering, who on their own have made a satellite, which was launched on 22nd June.
In a way, this academic satellite is a living example of the soaring flight of courage and ambition of the young India.
That has led these our students to make this satellite.
On similar lines as achieved by these Pune students, the students of Satyabhama University of Chennai in Tamil Nadu also created their satellite; and their SathyabamaSAT has also been launched.
We have been hearing these things since childhood, and every child wishes deep inside his heart to touch the sky and grab a few stars.
Keeping this in mind, in my opinion, these two satellites made by the students and launched by ISRO, are extremely important and most valuable.
All these students deserve hearty congratulations.
And this is also a matter of joy that of the twenty satellites which were launched in India, 17 satellites were from other countries.
And for this very reason, many countries of the world are today looking towards India for the launching of their satellites.
My dear Countrymen, “Save the Girl Child, Educate the Girl Child” (Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao), has already become the Mann Ki Baat, the heartfelt wish of all the people of India.
Still, some incidents infuse a new life into this slogan.
This time in the results of 10th and 12th classes, our daughters have been doing wonderfully well, which is a matter of pride.
What these three daughters have accomplished is truly special.
Flying Officer Avni is from Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, Flying Officer Bhawana is from Begusarai in Bihar and Flying Officer Mohana is from Vadodara in Gujarat.
Despite hailing from small cities and towns, they nurtured dreams as high as the sky, and they also made them come true.
I extend my heartiest wishes to these three daughters Avni, Bhawana and Mohana as well as their parents.
My dear Countrymen, a few days ago on 21st June, the whole world organised grand shows in observance of the anniversary of the International Day for Yoga.
We are forging a unique bond with the rest of the world.
In India too, the International Yoga Day was celebrated at over 1 lakh places, with a lot of fervour and enthusiasm in myriad forms and hues, and in an atmosphere of gaiety.
I also got an opportunity to perform Yoga in Chandigarh amidst thousands of Yoga lovers.
It was worth watching the zeal of the young and old alike.
You must have seen that last week the Indian government issued a postage stamp on ‘Surya Namaskar’ on the occasion of International Yoga Day.
This time, people all over the world, on Yoga Day, were witness to two special events.
One was at New York City where the United Nations Organisation -UNO Head Quarters building is located.
A special projection depicting different postures of the various yoga asanas was organized on top of that building.
And passersby kept taking pictures of these, and these pictures soon were being shared all over the world.
Tell me, which Indian would not feel proud at such happenings?
Social media has created an identity of its own.
And this time Twitter carried out a light hearted pleasant experiment in Yoga with its ‘Yoga imaging’.
As soon as we typed ‘hash tag yoga day’, we would immediately get a picture of a yoga image on our mobile.
And this image too went viral all over the world.
Yoga by itself means adding – getting connected.
Yoga has the power to connect the entire world.
But for that to happen, first all of us need to get connected to Yoga.
And I have seen that there are some countries in the world which have T.V. channels exclusively dedicated to Yoga 24 hours a day.
And you probably know that, during the month of June, in view of the International Yoga Day, I used to share a video everyday of one particular asana of Yoga through Twitter and Face Book.
Can we control Diabetes through Yoga?
Some people have been successful in that.
Everyone has searched for a wayin this regard.
All the rights of the citizens were suspended.
The country was turned into a prison.
Lakhs of people along with Jai Prakash Narain, thousands of leaders, many organisations were put behind bars.
Many books have been written on that dark period.
Many discussions have been held on it.
Our strength lies in each and every citizen of our country.
And we must keep reminding our country of its democratic strength from time to time.
I always stress that Democracy doesn’t merely mean that people vote for you and give you the contract to run this country for five years.
Certainly Not!
My endeavour has always been to ensure that the nation moves forward on the strength of people’s participation.
In a way it had a tone of challenge as well as advice.
But that stirred my mind.
I raised this topic with some of my senior colleagues.
One generation still feels that it is best to keep away from the government.
Today I want to impress upon you that we end up losing our peace of mind by trying to escape from rules and regulations.
As a result, anybody can trouble and harass us.
Why should we let this happen?
Why don’t we, on our own, give the correct details of our income and property to the government, so that we can rid ourselves from the burden of hitherto undeclared assets?
The government has presented before the country a special facility to disclose undisclosed income by the 30th of September.
We can be free ourselves of various burdens just by paying a fine.
I want to say this to the people of the country that we do not wish that after the 30th September anything should happen that will cause difficulties for you.
And so I say that please avail of this facility before this date and save yourselves from any possible trouble after the 30th of September.
And I have told them in clear words that we should not perceive citizens as crooks.
We should have trust and faith in the citizens.
We should hold hands with them.
It is important to build an atmosphere of trust.
We shall have to reassure the taxpayer.
We have to change this situation.
And this has to change before 30th September.
Before taking any extreme steps, the government must give a chance to the people.
And so my dear brothers and sisters, this is a golden chance for you to disclose your undisclosed income.
And in another way, this is the way out to save yourself from any trouble that could arise after 30th September.
My dear countrymen, the common man of this country is always looking for a chance to do something for the country.
And now I want to cite an example especially for those people who have undisclosed income.
I had called them especially to meet me.
Do you know what the reason is?
Shri Chandrakant Kulkarni is an ordinary man who belongs to an average middle class family.
He used to work for the government.
Then he retired.
No one could be a greater source of inspiration than Chandrakant Kulkarni.
He has given a message regarding water conservation.
Friends, his experience can be of use to you as well: –
We should make every effort to conserve every single drop of water.
How can we retain the rainwater of the villages there itself and similarly preserve rainwater of cities therein.
To recharge Mother Earth once again, how can we replenish water back to the earth?
If there is water today, only then can there be a tomorrow.
Water is the basis of all life.
An atmosphere has certainly been created in the country.
Lately, in all the states a lot of measures have been taken for water conservation.
We need to restructure the international legal framework to deal with the unique challenges of terrorism.
We have to help each other secure our cyber space, and minimize use of internet and social media for terrorist activities.

Excellencies, and Friends,
Our region is blessed to have given to the world the invaluable gift of Buddha and his teachings.
Bodh Gaya in India, where Prince Siddhartha became the Buddha, is the sacred nucleus of the Buddhist universe.
Buddhism and its various strandsare deep seated in our governance, cultureand philosophy.
Mahindra and Sanghamitra, the worthy children of King Ashokamade their journey from India to Sri Lankaas धम्मा दूत to spread the biggest gift of धम्मा.
And, as Buddha had himself said:सब्ब्दानामधम्मादानं जनाती, meaning, the gift of धम्मा is the biggest gift of all.
Today, Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important nerve centres of Buddhist teachings and learning.
The friendship between India and Sri Lanka was etched in time by the “Great Master”.
Buddhism imparts an ever present radiance to our relationship.
Ours is a friendship that lives in the hearts of our peopleand in the fabric of our societies.
To honour and deepen our links of Buddhist heritage, I have the great pleasure to announce that from August this year,Air India will operate direct flights between Colombo and Varanasi.
This will ease travel to the land of Buddha for my brothers and sisters from Sri Lanka, and help you directly visit Sravasti, Kusinagar, Sankasa, Kaushambi and Sarnath.
Venerable Monks, Excellencies and Friends,
India’s rapid growthcan bring dividends for the entire region, especially in Sri Lanka.
In infrastructure and connectivity,transport and energy,we are poised to scale up our cooperation.
Today,India’s development cooperation with Sri Lankaamounts toUS Dollars 2.6 billion.
Because, the economic and social well being of the people of Sri Lankais linked with that of 1.25 billion Indians.
The मध्यम प्रतिपदा , the Middle Path shown by Buddha, speaks to all of us.
Its universality and evergreen nature is striking.
The themes of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace,chosen for the Vesak day,resonate deeply with Buddha’s teachings.
The themes may appear independent.
But, they are both deeply interdependentand interconnected.
The issue of Social justiceis linked to conflictwithin and among communities.
It is from the mindsets,thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence.
The menace of terrorism in our region is a concrete manifestation of this destructive emotion.
And, not just a negative notion of peace defined by the absence of conflict.
But, a positive peace where we all work to promote dialogue, harmony and justice, based on compassion and wisdom.
As Buddha said,”नत्तीसंतिपरणसुखं”, “there is no higher bliss than peace”.
On Vesak, my hope is that India and Sri Lanka will work together to uphold the ideals of Lord Buddha and promote values of peace, accommodation, inclusiveness, and compassion in the policies and conduct of our governments.
This is the true path to free individuals, families, societies, nations and the world at large from the three poisons of greed, hatred and ignorance.
Venerable Monks, Excellencies and friends,
I look forward to paying homage at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, in Kandy today afternoon.
May the Triple Gem of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha bless us all.
Thank you, Thank you very much

FDI policy on Pharmaceuticals sector inter-alia provides that definition of medical device as contained in the FDI Policy would be subject to amendment in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2018 which was last reviewed and issued in 2011, with periodic amendments to some clauses.
It will not only result in significant employment generation but also to better life and add value to the economy of India.
The new notification is expected to rejuvenate the coastal areas while reducing their vulnerabilities.
(ii) Densely populated rural areas to be afforded greater opportunity for development: For CRZ-III (Rural) areas, two separate categories have now been stipulated as below:
(a) CRZ-III A – These are densely populated rural areas with a population density of 2161 per square kilometre as per 2011 Census.

Such areas shall continue to have an NDZ of 200 meters from the HTL.
(iii)Tourism infrastructure for basic amenities to be promoted: Temporary tourism facilities such as shacks, toilet blocks, change rooms, drinking water facilities etc. have now been permitted in Beaches.
Such temporary tourism facilities are also now permissible in the “No Development Zone” (NDZ) of the CRZ-III areas as per the Notification.
However, a minimum distance of 10 m from HTL should be maintained for setting up of such facilities.
(iv)CRZ Clearances streamlined: The procedure for CRZ clearances has been streamlined.
Only such projects/activities, which are located in the CRZ-I (Ecologically Sensitive Areas) and CRZ IV (area covered between Low Tide Line and 12 Nautical Miles seaward) shall be dealt with for CRZ clearance by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

The Shailesh Nayank Committee held wide ranging consultations with State Governments and other stakeholders and submitted its recommendations in 2015.
The recommendations were further examined in consultation with Members of Parliament of Coastal States and Union Territories besides other concerned Ministries of Government of India.
A draft notification was issued in April, 2018 for inviting comments from public at large.
Tourism has been one of the greatest creators of livelihood and jobs.
The new Notification will boost tourism in terms of more activities, more infrastructure and more opportunities and will certainly go a long way in creating employment opportunities in various aspects of tourism.

We are delighted that His Highness has come back to India on his second State visit.
And, with his participation as our honoured Chief Guest in the Republic Day Celebrations tomorrow this visit is particularly special.
Our discussions were wide ranging covering the entire spectrum of our bilateral engagement.
Personally, I benefitted immensely from your perspective of our partnership, your appreciation of our region and your world view.
Your Highness, under your leadership, we have been successful in creating new synergies in our ties.
I have just concluded very fruitful and productive discussions with His Highness.
We regard UAE as an important partner in India’s growth story.
I particularly welcome UAE’s interest in investing in India’s infrastructure sector.
We are working to connect the institutional investors in UAE with our National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
I also shared with His Highness the interest of Indian companies to be a partner in infrastructure projects for the World EXPO 2020 in Dubai.

In this regard, long-term supply contracts and establishment of joint ventures in the energy sector can be beneficial avenues.

Yunmo Sung, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy,
This is my third interaction with the Korean business leaders in the span of just 12 months.
This intensity is intentional.
I wish to see more and more Korean businesses turning their attention to India.
Even when I was the Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat, I traveled to Korea.
India has emerged as a land of opportunities.
While we work for realizing the ‘Indian Dream’, we seek like-minded partners.
And, among them, we see South Korea is truly natural partner.
India-Korea Business relations have come a long way in the past decade, and especially closer in the last few years.
Our trade volume has reached 21.5 billion Dollars for the calendar year 2018.
The negotiations to upgrade Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement have been fast-tracked to achieve the bilateral trade target of 50 billion Dollars by 2030.
Not just trade, in investment terms also we are seeing a positive turn.
And, Korean investments into India have reached a cumulative figure of almost 6 billion Dollars.
After my visit to Korea in 2015, we launched a Korea specific facilitation cell “Korea Plus” under ‘Invest India’ to guide, assist and handhold investors during the entire life-cycle of the business.
Hyundai, Samsung, LG electronics have become trustworthy brands in India.
And, Kia is soon to join this club.
Over 600 Korean companies have invested in India.
And, we aspire to welcome many more.
And, to ease your path, Visa on Arrival for Korean nationals has been put in place since October last year.
We encourage the presence of Korean Trade Offices in India.
And, I am glad that we recently had the sixth office of KOTRA opened in Ahmedabad.
Let me tell you a little more about what is happening in India now.
The fundamentals of our economy are sound.
We are well set to become a 5 trillion dollar economy in the near future.
No other large economy in the world is growing at over 7% year after year.
Hard policy decisions such as the introduction of Goods and Services Tax have been taken.
In the last four years, we have jumped 65 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking, to 77th.
And, we are determined to move into the top 50 next year.
We are one of the most open countries for Foreign Direct Investment today.
More than 90 percent of our sectors are now on automatic route for approval.
As a result of this and the confidence in India, we have received FDI worth over 250 billion Dollars over the past four years.
In India, we are also focused on making our growth inclusive.
It is for this reason that we have taken strong initiatives for financial inclusion.
In the course of the past three years, we have opened over 300 million bank accounts for those who never had a bank account.
They now have access to affordable pensions and insurance.
Under the Mudra scheme, we have extended micro credit worth more than 90 billion dollars to 128 million persons over the past three years.
74 percent of these loans have gone to women.
We have leveraged the power of a biometric identity system, bank accounts and mobile phones, to deliver subsidies and services to the previously unbanked.
Government benefits worth more than 50 billion Dollars are now transferred directly to the beneficiaries, thus eliminating leakages.
We have taken huge strides in rural electrification.
India is now recognised by the International Energy Agency as one of the greatest success stories in bringing about rural access to energy in 2018.
In renewable energy, we have become the sixth largest producer in the world.
This, and our initiative of the International Solar Alliance, will enable India to be a pioneer in moving towards a green Global economy.
That is our commitment to a green and sustainable future.
Through these steps, the way of life of our people in all corners of the country is being transformed.
This, in turn, is transforming governance and public service.
Economic progress is closely tied to world-class infrastructure.
Recognizing the importance of supporting India’s infrastructure development, India and South Korea have identified 10 billion Dollars under Korea’s Economic Development Cooperation Fund and Export Credit, to finance such projects.
While aiming for fast economic growth, India is also rooted in the principles of ensuring sustainable economic growth.
For example in Automobile sector, The National electric mobility mission aims for affordable and efficient Electric Vehicles.
South Korea being a leading manufacturer of Electric Vehicles has a huge opportunity in this sector in India.
Research and innovation would be the driving force in 4th industrial revolution era.
And, we do understand that the role of government is to provide the support system.
In this regard, we have introduced flagship program Start-up India with 1.4 billion Dollars fund for four years to create a startup ecosystem in India.
Under the able leadership of President Moon, South Korea has also unveiled a program to spend 9.4 billion Dollars by 2020 in a bid to increase capital supply for startups and venture-friendly environment.
This synergy in policy regimes is a reflection of areas of common interest for both India and Korea.
Our vision of an India-Korea Startup Centre – will provide a hub for Korean startups and Indian talent to freely communicate.
South Korean National IT Industry promotion Agency has already opened their Indian office in Bengaluru to facilitate Korean startups to India.
It is our earnest desire to work with Republic of Korea more closely to realize the dream of our citizens.
Efforts by the Governments will not be realized unless business leaders like you share the same dreams.
I would like to conclude here with Korean expression:
I entirely agree with its meaning, that, “you would go fast if you go alone, but you would go far if you go together”.
Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, India
Secretary General, International Energy Forum
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Welcome to India.
Welcome to the 16thInternational Energy Forum Ministerial Meeting.
As you come together today to discuss the future of global energy,the world is seeing a great transition in energy supply and consumption.
• Consumption growth has shifted to non OECD countries: Middle East, Africa and developing Asia;
• Abundant availability of natural gas globally with increased percentage of LNG and natural gas is contributing to the primary energy basket;
• Coal may gradually go out of favour as a major contributor to primary energy in the OECD World and later in developing countries;
We are entering an era of energy abundance.
Let us use this platformto build a global consensus on ‘responsible pricing.’This will serve the mutual interestsof both producers and consumers.
Given global un-certainties,India also needs energy security.My vision for India’s energy future has 4 pillars– energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security.
Energy in general and hydrocarbons in particularare an important part of my vision for India’s future.
India needs energy which is accessibleand affordable to the poor.
Our Down-stream sectorhas been completely liberalizedwith market driven petrol and diesel pricesreflecting the changes in price of crude oil.
Our government has encouraged private participationacross the entire oil and gas value chainfrom up-stream production to down-stream retail.
Our Government believesin an integrated approach to energy planning.
And,our energy agenda in Indiais inclusive,market based,and climate-sensitive.
Universal access to modern energy by 2030;
Urgent action to tackle climate change – in line with the Paris agreement;
Measures to improve air quality;
We believe access to clean cooking fuelis very important to improve standards of living.
Women benefit the most from it.
We have also launched a vehicle scrapping policywhich will help replace old vehicles with cleaner and energy efficient vehicles.
As we are all aware, we are now looking towards Industry 4.0, proposing to change the way industry operates in the future with new technologies and processes like Internet of Things, Artificial intelligence, robotics process automation, machine learning, predictive analytics, 3-D printing, etc.
In this backdrop,India provides the perfect setting for hosting this event, to ponder over the future of the energy sector.To reflect on how global shifts, transition policies and new technologieswill influence market stability and future investment in the sector.
These are all pertinentsubjects for the future of our collective energy security.

10 outstanding Start-up innovators shared their thoughts and experiences before the Prime Minister delivered his address.
He said that when he had launched the Start-up India Initiative on 15th August, the announcement had virtually gone unnoticed, but today it had registered with people.
He said successful start-ups are usually created by those who are driven by an idea, or an urge to solve a problem that people face.
He said making money is not the primary objective, but is often a by-product.
He said Start-up innovators are often driven by a sense of compassion for others.
The Prime Minister said he wishes to turn the youth of India from job-seekers to job-creators.
He said if a Start-up can offer employment to even five people, it would be doing a great service to the nation.
He mentioned some areas where youth innovators should focus, including crop wastage, and cyber security.
The Prime Minister unveiled the highlights of the Start-up Action Plan.
He said a dedicated Start-up fund worth Rs. 10,000 crore will be created for funding of Start-ups.

The Bill had been examined by the Standing Committee of Parliament which had made a number of recommendations for changing the provisions of the Bill.
India is one of the largest manufacturers of pharmaceutical products in the world.
The annual production of such products is in excess of Rs. 2 lakh crore.
Out of this, over 55% is exported to over 200 countries/economies of the world including the developed countries.
As such, the pharmaceutical sector in India plays a vital role in managing the public health in large number countries at a substantially lower cost.
The regulatory framework for ensuring the quality, safety and efficacy of medical products including the medicines, medical devices, in-vitro medical devices, stem cells, regenerative medicines, clinical trial/investigation, etc. is provided for in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.
The Cabinet has, keeping in view the role of the sector in managing public health, decided that it will not be appropriate to carry out further amendments in the present Act especially as newer areas of biological, stem cells and regenerative medicines, medical devices and clinical trial/investigation, etc. cannot be effectively regulated under the existing law.
Keeping in view the objective of make in India, it has been decided to comprehensively review the existing law with two fold objectives viz. to facilitate the ease of doing business and substantially enhancing the quality and efficacy of our products.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has, accordingly, undertaken an exercise at two levels namely (i) to frame separate rules under the existing Act for regulating medical devices; and (ii) to bring out separate legislations for regulating medical devices and Drugs and Cosmetics.
While, after extensive discussions with all stakeholders, the draft rules for regulating medical devices have been prepared and will be draft notified shortly, work on drafting the new legislation has also commenced.

In a historical move that will add record strength in the fight against corruption, black money, money laundering, terrorism and financing of terrorists as well as counterfeit notes, the Government of India has decided that the five hundred and one thousand rupee notes will no longer be legal tender from midnight, 8th November 2016.
Notes of one hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, two and one rupee will remain legal tender and will remain unaffected by the decision today.
He said that these decisions will fully protect the interests of honest and hard-working citizens of India and that those five hundred and one thousand rupee notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become worthless pieces of paper.
The Prime Minister said the steps taken by the Government would strengthen the hands of the common citizens in the fight against corruption, black money and counterfeit notes.
The efforts have borne fruit.
India is a preferred destination for investment and India is also an easier place to do business in.
Combined with this, Indian enterprise and innovation has received a fillip due to the ‘Make in India’, ‘Start up India’ and ‘Stand up India’ initiatives that seek to celebrate enterprise, innovation and research in India.

I am happy to join you today, through Video Conferencing, at the Annual International Yoga Festival.
Yesterday, they added another feather in their cap by successfully testing a low altitude interceptor missile.
This is a capability that only four other nations currently possess.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We in India believe in researching both the frontiers of science and technology, as also, researching deep within our souls, that is, both Science, and Yoga.
Perhaps, there can be no better place than Rishikesh, to host the International Yoga Festival.
This, indeed, is a place that has drawn sages, pilgrims, commoners and celebrities alike, over millennia, in quest for peace, and for the true essence of Yoga.
And in most cases, that quest, has led them, to Yoga.
It expands our limited sense of self, to see our families, societies and mankind, as extensions of our own self.
Oneness with our families, with the society we live in, with fellow humans, with all the birds, animals and trees with whom we share our beautiful planet…this is Yoga.
Yoga is the journey from ‘me’ to ‘we.’
Yoga offers a timeless, simple, and healthy alternative.
There is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps combat stress and chronic lifestyle-related conditions.
When we talk of global peace, there should be peace among nations.
That is possible only when there is peace within the society.
Only peaceful families can constitute peaceful society.
Only peaceful individuals can make peaceful families.
Yoga is the way to create such a harmony and peace within individuals, family, society, nation and ultimately all over the world.
When we talk of combating climate change, we seek to move away from a lifestyle of consumption, or “Bhoga”, to one of Yoga.
At a time, when emphasis is on personal gain, and what one may get out of any endeavour, Yoga offers a refreshingly different approach.
Yoga is not about what one can get out of it.
It is rather about what one can give up, what one can get rid of.
Therefore, instead of attainment, Yoga shows us the path to liberation, or Mukti, as we call it in this part of the world.
Swami Chidanand Saraswati ji, through his work at Parmarth Niketan has shown a way to live these noble ideals.
I appreciate the work being done by Parmarth Niketan in bringing Yoga to people across the world.
I recall the active role played by Swami ji, in compiling the 11 volume Encyclopaedia of Hinduism.
Remarkably, Swamiji and his team have accomplished this mission in less than a quarter of a century.
And the depth of their work is amazing.
This increased under-standing, in turn, reduces hatred, misunderstanding and increases cooperation, peace and amity among communities.
Let me also take this opportunity, to compliment Parmarth Niketan, for the active role played by them in the Swachh Bharat Mission – a mass movement towards Clean India.
Indian traditions lay a strong emphasis on personal hygiene.
Not only is keeping one’s body clean and pure emphasized, but also cleanliness in one’s house, place of work and place of worship is given a lot of priority.
There is, however, a tendency to dump dirt in open spaces.
This is not true for western and other developed countries, where the link between community hygiene and public health is more clearly understood.
Awareness and observance of hygiene of public goods like water bodies, land and air is crucial.
Through the Swachh Bharat Mission, we are attempting to establish the link between community hygiene and personal health.
However, with passage of time, they were surrounded by markets, and residential colonies.
And hence, they face unclean surroundings as a major challenge.
In the first phase, we have taken Kamakhya Temple, Jagannath Puri, Meenakshi Temple, Tirupati, Golden Temple, and Vaishno Devi temple for making them and their surroundings clean.
We were all witness to the great global upsurge for Yoga when, in September 2014, I proposed an International Day of Yoga, at the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
And now, every year, on the occasion of Summer Solstice – June 21 – the world comes together, for Yoga.
Yoga has the potential to herald in a new Yuga (a new era) – a Yuga of peace, compassion, brotherhood and all-round progress of the human race.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
May you find fulfilment and bliss, in this great festival of Yoga, on the banks of the River Ganga, where our sages and rishis have meditated for millennia.
I am delighted to inaugurate the Indian Pavilion.
This is the first day of a historic summit in Paris.
We stand here in solidarity with Paris and France and in admiration for their resolve and courage.
The entire world, 196 Nations, have come together to shape the future of this world and the health of our planet.
This summit is of great significance to India’s future, too.
This pavilion is a window to our heritage and our progress; our traditions and our technology; our aspirations and our achievements.
India’s new economic momentum is a subject of international attention and a source of global opportunity.
Our progress will not just change the lives of one-sixth of humanity.
It will also mean a more successful and prosperous world.
Equally, the choices the world makes here will have an impact on our development.
Climate change is a major global challenge.
But, climate change is not of our making.
But, we in India face its consequences today.
We see it in the risks of our farmers, the changes in weather patterns, and the intensity of natural disasters.
We are concerned about the rising oceans that will threaten our 7500 km of coastline and over 1300 islands.
We worry about the retreat of glaciers that feed our rivers and nurture our civilisation.
That is why the outcome in Paris so important.
That is why we are here.
We want the world to act with urgency.
The extent of their commitment and the strength of their action must be consistent with the carbon space they occupy.
And, they must leave enough of what is left of our carbon space to let developing countries grow.
They should share resources and technology with those who live between want and hope, so that we can meet the universal aspiration for clean energy.
We want the conviction of the world to be matched by efforts to create conditions in which we can succeed.
India’s progress is our destiny and the right of our people.
But, we are a Nation that must also lead in combating climate change.
It stems from our obligation to give our people clean air; clean rivers; resilient farms; healthy habitats; and, forests rich with life.
It comes from our conviction that we must aim not just for higher incomes, but better quality of life.
It comes from our commitment to the world.
Above all, it arises, from our timeless traditions and beliefs.
The choices a people make are shaped by their culture and beliefs.
In India, Nature has always been treated as Mother.
Since ancient times, we have seen humanity as part of Nature, not superior to it.
The divine has manifested in Nature’s diverse forms.
O Lord of Field, with the Sweet Waves of Mother Nature’s blessings, may you milk our Fields like the Milk of a Cow.
With the Sweetness of Mother Nature’s bounty, which falls like Clarified Butter, may You shed your Grace on us.
This is what we have tried to capture in the publication PARAMPARA that we have released today.
This is why recycling and conservation comes naturally to us.
And, why we have sacred groves across our Nation.
And, it is this spirit that leads us to set an ambitious and comprehensive strategy to combat climate change.
We have a target for renewable generation of 175 Gigawatt by 2022.
Like cellular phones before, we can use renewable energy to bring power to our 18000 unconnected villages quickly and cleanly.
By 2030, 40% of our installed capacity will be based on non-fossil fuel.
We will convert waste to energy.
And, we have introduced tax free bonds for renewable energy.
We have a massive programme to expand our forest cover and protect our biodiversity.
Our mission of “more crop per drop” will not only improve the lives of farmers, but will also reduce the pressure on a scarce resource.
And, research and innovation in clean energy is a high priority.
We want to make conventional energy, like coal, cleaner.
We will make renewable energy cheaper and convenient to install even in our homes.
We want to make it more reliable and easier to feed into our transmission lines.
From governments to communities, there are countless examples of innovation and enterprise that are restoring the health of our environment.
I have tried to capture some of these initiatives in my book, Convenient Action, which we shall present today.
India’s leadership on environment has been the vision of Indian leaders and successive governments – from Stockholm in 1975 to Copenhagen in 2009.
We are raising our National effort to an entirely new level.
And, we are intensifying our international partnerships.
President Hollande and I will also co-chair the launch of my long cherished dream of an international solar alliance to promote greater use of solar energy in the 121 solar-rich Nations.
To call the world to look deep into the ancient wisdom of all our civilisations, cultures and religions, I had requested President Hollande to bring out a book of quotations from around the world.
I am happy that we will release it today.
For, the enduring success of our efforts will depend on the way we live and think.
In conclusion, therefore, let me return to the theme that defines us in India – the spirit of partnership, the belief in oneness with the whole that is Nature.
To the people of India and our friends in the world, I call you to live with the commitment of ‘Lokah Samastah Sukhinau Bhavantu’.
The desire for well being should include our planet, our Nature, all countries and the entire humanity.
If our thinking is right, we will form a true global partnership of capabilities and needs that leads us to a low carbon age.
The nation stands shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of grief”, the Prime Minister said.
iii) Communicable Diseases;
A Working Group will be set up to further elaborate the details of cooperation and to oversee the implementation of this MoU.
Thus, now, the Estate Officer can make such inquiry as he deems expedient in the circumstances of the case and thus do not have to follow the elaborate procedures prescribed as per sections 4, 5 and 7 of the Act.
Estate Officers can even make an order for the eviction of such persons forthwith following the procedure proposed in the new section.
If such persons refuse or fail to comply with the said order of eviction, Estate Officer may evict them from premises and take possession thereof and may, for that purpose, use such force as may be necessary.
The amendment will thus facilitate smooth and speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from government residences.
The amendments will facilitate smooth and speedy eviction of unauthorised occupants from government residence, as non-vacation in time leads to unavailability of houses to new incumbents and will increase the availability of the residential accommodation benefitting the waitlisted persons.
The Government of India has to evict unauthorized occupants from Government accommodations under the provisions of PPE Act, 1971.
However, the eviction proceedings take unusually long time, thereby reducing the availability of govt. accommodations to new incumbents.
He said that these awards offer an opportunity for recognition of talented children, and serve as inspiration for others like them.
The Prime Minister urged the extra-ordinarily gifted children to stay connected with nature.
He shared some light and informal moments with the children who also requested him for autographs.
The Rashtriya Bal Puraskar awards have been given in two categories: Bal Shakti Puraskar to individuals; and Bal Kalyan Puraskar to institutions/individuals working for children.
A total of 783 applications were received for the Bal Shakti Puraskar this year.
The Ministry for Women and Child Development selected 26 awardees for Bal Shakti Puraskar, under the category of innovation, scholastic, sports, arts & culture, social service and bravery.
In order to carry out these changes, an official amendment to the National Waterways Bill, 2015 will have to be moved in the Lok Sabha in the current Session of Parliament.
Declaration of the above additional 106 waterways as National Waterways would not have any immediate financial implications.
The right over the use of water, river bed and the appurtenant land will remain with the State Government.
The budget has plans for ambitious schemes to bring in a qualitative change in their lives.
This budget presents a comprehensive , time bound action plan for poverty alleviation.
Several measures have been outlined to double the income of the farmers.
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana is one of them where a substantial allocation has been made to ensure water to every farm.
All of us know the importance of power and road infrastructure .
There is a vision in this budget to connect every village to road by 2019.
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana has been allocated substantial funds to connect the rural India by roads.
Besides there is a clear plan to provide electricity to every village by 2018.
Owning a house is his biggest dream.
Everyone from a middle class or neo middle class wants to own a house.
How are we going to help them realize this dream?
This is not possible without the help of the government.
That’s why provisions have been made this time to give impetus to the housing sector and ensure a house to general household.
People who are living in rented house have also got increased rebate in Income Tax over House Rent.
Those who are earning up to 5 lakhs will have to pay lesser tax.
There has been a lot of politics over the poor.
You will be amazed to know that if a poor lady who cooks food for her children using a Chulha faces adverse impact on her and her children’s health.
Experts say that the smoke of that chulha , is equivalent to the smoke of 400 cigarettes per day.
We have to help people below the poverty line and that’s why we have decided to provide free gas connection to such people.
5 crore families who use chulha for cooking will get freedom from smoke.
Poor will get health benefits and environment will protected as well.
Our government is also taking important decisions in health sector.
At times, an ailment can destroy life of a poor family or a middle class family or a neo middle class family.
We have presented schemes for senior citizens who are in dire need of help.
You might have seen that in infrastructure a provision of more than 2 lakh crore Rupees has been made.
This will benefit our forces who are guarding our borders.
The youth of the country is moving ahead.
In order to provide him employment opportunities we are going to come out with two new initiatives, ‘formalizing the informal’ and ‘employing the unemployed.’
My Mantra is Start Up India, Stand Up India.
To provide a favorable ecosystem for startups, the budget has provided plans in the taxes.
Our Dalit and Tribal youth now wants to become an entrepreneur.
He doesn’t want to be Job Seeker anymore but a Job Creator.
In order to make him realize his dream, the government has decided to establish an entrepreneurial hub.
Primary education is equally important.
Till now, the governments have been focusing on expansions of primary education which was also important but in order to combat today’s challenges qualitative change is also required with expansion.
Traders and professionals who are facing such problems should be made free from it.
This budget has presented the commitment of government towards realizations of your dreams.
President Hollande, Excellencies,
The pain of Paris is yet to heal.
So, I speak in admiration for your resilience and resolve.
And, I salute the world for standing, in full strength, with France and Paris.
Over the next few days, we will decide the fate of this planet.
We do so when the consequences of the industrial age powered by fossil fuel are evident, especially on the lives of the poor.
The prosperous still have a strong carbon footprint.
And, the world’s billions at the bottom of the development ladder are seeking space to grow.
So, the choices are not easy.
But, we have awareness and technology.
We need now national will and a genuine global partnership.
We are determined to do so, guided by our ancient belief that people and planet are inseparable; that human well being and Nature are indivisible.
So, we have set ambitious targets.
We will enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2.5 billion tonnes worth of carbon dioxide.
We hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely.
It is not just a question of historical responsibility.
They also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact.
And, climate justice demands that, with the little carbon space we still have, developing countries should have enough scope to grow.
This also means aggressive mitigation action by developed countries before 2020, including ratification of 2nd Commitment period of Kyoto Protocol, removing conditions and revisiting targets.
We also need a strong Agreement on Adaptation and Loss and Damage.
This is in our collective interest.
So, we look to the developed countries to mobilize 100 billion US Dollars annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in the developing countries.
They must fulfill their commitment in a credible, transparent and meaningful manner.
Energy is a basic human need.
We still need conventional energy.
We should make it clean, not impose an end to its use.
And, there should be no place for unilateral steps that become economic barriers for others.
We welcome stocktaking that is transparent, covers both support and commitments, and based on differentiation.
Ultimately, for success, moderating our lifestyle is necessary, and possible, for a low carbon future.
The presence of 196 countries tells us that we have a chance to unite behind a common purpose.
We will succeed if we have the wisdom and courage to craft a genuinely collective partnership that balances responsibilities and capabilities with aspirations and needs.
I am confident that we will.
The Prime Minister also appreciated the leadership and contribution of outgoing Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth to strengthening the strong bonds of friendship between India and Mauritius.
He will lay the foundation stone for the four laning of the Falakata – Salsalabari section of NH -31 D there.
This 41.7 km long section of National Highways falls in the Jalpaiguri district in West Bengal, and will be constructed at a cost of about Rs 1938 Crore.
The project will reduce the distance from Salsalabari and Alipurduar to Siliguri by nearly 50 km.
This is significant as better access to Siliguri means better access to railways and airways.
The National Highway will facilitate better movement of tea and other agricultural produce from the region to markets.
The improved connectivity will also lead to an increase in tourism in the region.
The National Highway will incorporate all necessary safety features to provide relief to road users.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiwill also inaugurate New High Court Circuit Bench at Jalpaiguri.
The Circuit bench of Calcutta High Court at Jalpaiguri will provide speedy justice to people of Darjeeling,Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar in North Bengal.
Residents of these four districts will now have to travel less than 100 km to access the bench instead of 600km trip to Calcutta High Court.

Due to heightened financial risk and volatility in global economy, short term swap requirements of SAARC countries could be higher than the agreed lines.
The incorporation of ‘Standby Swap’ within the approved SAARC Swap Framework would provide necessary flexibility to the Framework and would enable India to provide a prompt response to the current request from SAARC member countries for availing the swap amount exceeding the present limit prescribed under the SAARC Swap Framework.
Each Drawal will be for three months tenor and upto maximum of two rollovers.
RBI will negotiate the operational details bilaterally with the Central Banks of the SAARC countries availing the Standby Swap.

“As the Asian Games 2018 come to a close, I once again congratulate the Indian contingent for their excellent performance.
The 2018 Games have been the best for India in the history of the Asian Games.
Every athlete who took part in the Games is India’s pride.
During the Asian Games 2018, we consolidated our position in events where we have historically been strong and won laurels in those games in which we have not won much previously.
This is an extremely positive sign and it augurs well for Indian sports.
I salute the coaches, support staff, parents, family and friends of the athletes.
Thank you for constantly supporting our champions.
My best wishes to all our athletes for their future endeavours.
Congratulations to President Joko Widodo and the people of Indonesia for hosting such a memorable Asian Games 2018.

This will mark the third anniversary of three key Government initiatives related to Urban Development.
The Prime Minister will visit an exhibition on Flagship Missions of Urban Development.
He will lay the Foundation Stone for various projects under Flagship Missions, in the State of Uttar Pradesh.
This led to generation of investment intent worth more than Rs. 4.28 lakh crore across sectors like Renewable Energy, Infrastructure, Power, IT & Electronic Manufacturing, Tourism etc.

HPO as a separate entity within non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligation to cover LHPs commissioned after notification of these measures (SHPs are already covered under Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation).
The trajectory of annual HPO targets will be notified by Ministry of Power based on the projected capacity addition plans in hydropower sector.
Necessary amendments will be introduced in the Tariff Policy and Tariff Regulations to operationalize HPO.
Tariff rationalization measures including providing flexibility to the developers to determine tariff by back loading of tariff after increasing project life to 40 years, increasing debt repayment period to 18 years and introducing escalating tariff of 2%;
Budgetary support for funding flood moderation component of hydropower projects on case to case basis; and
It will also provide indirect employment/ entrepreneurial opportunities in the field of transportation, tourism and other small scale businesses.
Another benefit would be of having a stable grid considering 160 GW capacity addition by 2022 from infirm sources of power like solar and wind.
Only about 10,000 MW of hydropower has been added in the last 10 years.
Further, hydropower also provides water security, irrigation and flood moderation benefits, apart from socio-economic development of the entire region by providing employment opportunities and boosting tourism etc.
The importance of hydropower is increasing even more as the country has targeted to add 160 GW of intermittent Solar and Wind power by 2022 and 40% of the total capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 to honour its Nationally Determined Contribution for Climate Change.
However, DISOMS are reluctant sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) Hydro Power due to higher tariff, particularly, in the initial years.
One of the reasons for high tariff of hydropower is the loading of cost of flood moderation and enabling infrastructure in the project cost.
In this backdrop, the decision has been taken to adopt measures to promote hydropower sector including providing budgetary support for flood moderation cost and enabling infrastructure cost and tariff rationalization measures to reduce tariff and thus the burden on the consumer.
Our deep gratitude to all the members of UNGA as well as UNSC for their support and trust in India”, the Prime Minister said.

The IITs have built Brand India globally.
And they did it over the years.
It was a large number of IIT students who built the IT sector in India, brick by brick..or I should say, click by click.
Now India has become the destination for IT development.
And today, IIT graduates are at the forefront of some of the best start-ups in India.
These are start-ups that are also at the forefront of solving so many national problems.
To those working in the start-up movement or are planning to start one after College, please do remember that the biggest corporations of today were start-ups of yesterday.
They were the result of idealism combined with hard-work and diligence.
Keep at it, do not give up, and you will succeed.
You are fortunate to have lived in a campus like this, in a city like Mumbai.
You have a lake on one side, and the hills too.
Occasionally, you share your campus with crocodiles and leopards.
It is still August, but I am sure the mood is indigo today!
I am sure the last four years were a wonderful learning experience for you all.
There is so much to look back and remember the college festivals, inter hostel sports, student-faculty associations.
Students here represent the diversity of India.
From different states, speaking different languages, from different backgrounds, you merge here in pursuit of knowledge and learning.
Innovations and Enterprise are going to be the foundation stone for making India a developed economy.
Innovation is the buzzword of the 21st century.
Any society that does not innovate will stagnate.
That India is a emerging as a hub for start-ups shows that the thrust for innovation is very much there.
We must build on this further and make India the most attractive destination for innovation and enterprise.
And, this will not happen through Government efforts alone.
It will happen through youngsters like you.
The best ideas do not come in Government buildings or in fancy offices.
They come in campuses like yours, in the minds of youngsters like you.
My appeal to you and many other youngsters like you is: Innovate in India, Innovate for humanity.
From mitigating climate change to ensuring better agricultural productivity, From cleaner energy to water conservation, From combating malnutrition to effective waste management.
Let us affirm that the best ideas will come from Indian laboratories and from Indian students.
On our part, we are doing everything possible to foster a spirit of research and innovation in India.
(vi) Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) and George Washington University, USA;
Habaari gaani (Hello, How are you)?
I am happy to be here in energy filled surroundings.
I am truly delighted to be amongst the brightest and the best of Kenya.
You are the pride of this land; and represent Africa’s tomorrow.
Your aspirations, ambitions and actions will not only shape the direction and destiny of this great country.
But, you will also guide the march of this great continent into a future of prosperity.
To you, the passionate gen-next of Kenya, I bring the warm friendship of over 800 million youth of India.
J Of course, that includes me.
You see friends, when it comes to nation building, or nurturing ties with friends like Kenya, my heart matches the youthful passion of any twenty year old.
Dear Students,
The University of Nairobi is a glorious institution.
And, when I see your young, eager and intelligent faces, I know why.
Generations of political leaders, engineers scientists social activists and artists have passed through the doors of this seat of learning.
It has brought fame and repute to your country.
And, it continues to mould Kenya’s coming generations too.
The University also showcases the shared history and similar experiences of India and Kenya as two developing countries.
Just now, before entering this auditorium, I paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, whose statue at this University was unveiled exactly 60 years ago.
The connection between Mahatma Gandhi and this fine University is among early bonds of partnership between our two great nations.
Kenya is a young nation in an ancient continent.
But, even as a young nation you pride in several firsts.
Kenya’s Wangari Maathai, the famous environmental activist, was the first African woman to win the Nobel peace prize.
She was a product of this university.
Lupita Nyongo of Kenyan origin is the first African to have won an Oscar award.
And, as we all know, and no prize for guessing here, that Kenyan runners lead and dominate the marathon races the world over.
It is an important financial and transportation hub in the East African region.
It was in Kenya that M-Pesa was invented in 2007.
The idea took the world by storm.
And, through M-pesa, those who stayed on the margins of financial system are now being empowered and mainstreamed.
We now have a version in India as well.
Today, both Kenya and India are flourishing democracies.
We are two developing nations that seek peace and prosperity for their peoples.
And, our ties are age old.
Through centuries, the links of commerce and culture, trade and tradition, ideas and ideals, and beliefs and values have connected our societies.
And, in this, the warm waters of Indian Ocean have served as the bridge between our people.
I understand that there are 42 tribes in Kenya and that people of Indian origin are called the forty third tribe.
Like the rich fabric of your society, India too has a long-standing tradition of celebrating its vibrant diversity.
Indeed, along with democracy, freedom and equality, it is the very essence of modern India.
Last evening, President Kenyatta and I had a memorable interaction with the Indian diaspora.
Many decades ago, they made Kenya their home.
Their affection and loyalty to Kenya is foremost.
They are one of the most effective catalysts in the forward march of our ties.
And, this close inter-mingling of our people is a strong foundation for us to realize the promise of our modern day partnership.
Let us also not forget that together, India and Africa represent a third of humanity.
Contrary to what others might say, and there are many who might want to pull us down, we are by no means a minority in this inter-connected world.
We want to forge a lasting partnership:
Among the rising African economies, Kenya has been one of the strongest performers.
You are a land of strong traditions.
You are also a country with abundant opportunities.
On the other side of the Indian Ocean, at about 7.6% per annum, India is experiencing a great economic revolution.
Given the depth and extent of our challenges, there is no option for both of us but to sustain the high economic growth rate.
This opens up a world of opportunities for us to work together.
Not just in political sphere, but also in economic, social and developmental fields.
And, at several levels.
Already, we trade with each other more than ever before.
With significant presence of Indian companies in Kenya, our investment partnership is robust, diverse and vibrant.
This, in turn, creates jobs for the young and educated in both our societies.
As flow of goods and capital between us increases, we must explore ways of working together to manufacture in different areas.
Not just for Kenya and India but for Africa, and other regions.
Health care is one area that immediately comes to mind.
India’s experiences in this field can help build systems, institutions and capacities in Kenya.
And, our engagement in specialized medical skills can be of particular purpose and importance to Kenya’s youth.
Our growing trade ties in pharmaceuticals can be supplemented by manufacturing links.
They can respond to the health needs in Kenya.
And, also meet the health care demands regionally.
Kenya’s future is in the hands of its youth.
And for them, we have undertaken a nationwide campaign to create 500 million new jobs by 2022.
This, of course is not possible without skilling and educating our youth at a scale not seen before.
‘Skill India’ and ‘Start Up’ India are aimed at transforming the face of employment generation and personal enterprise in India.
We would be happy to share our capacities, experiences and abilities for the benefit of our Kenyan friends.
We already have a robust cooperation in the field of institution and capacity building, especially in the field of education.
But, that is not enough.
The need of the hour is to diversify it to areas such as Telecom, agriculture, energy and Information Technology.
Areas that would not just propel and modernize our economies, but, also create jobs for our skilled youth.
Our shared developmental challenges do not face the problem of scale.
And, between us we have the ability to generate access to cost efficient technologies.
M-pesa showed how, combined with technology, a home grown idea can quickly and effectively transform the lives of excluded sections of our society.
As our economies grow and our partnership thrives, we have a responsibility to ensure that it is not heavy handed on environment.
Indeed, one of our shared values is respect for mother earth.
And, the Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai captured it beautifully.
She said, and I quote, “We need to promote development that does not destroy our environment.”
Our common tradition to live in harmony with nature is an ideal platform for us to build a partnership for “Green Africa.”
A partnership that would also create new economic opportunities.
In fact, protection of our environment is the prime driver for India to shape an International Solar Alliance.
It is aimed at harnessing the power of sun as a permanent renewable source of energy.
The Alliance, which currently enjoys partnership of over 120 countries, is also one of the emerging areas of our engagement with Kenya.
Similarly, India’s ancient heritage of yoga stands for holistic living that is in tune with nature.
I am delighted to know that over 7,000 yoga enthusiasts celebrated this International Yoga Day on 19 June in the grounds of the Nairobi University.
A steady march towards our economic goals is indeed a priority.
But, we also cannot ignore the safety of our people.
Our economic prosperity and social development would mean a lot more, if our societies were safe and our people secure.
As President Uhuru said in Delhi in October last year, terrorism is “an evil that knows no boundary, has no religion, no race and no values.”
Indeed, we live in a world where preachers of hate and violence are threatening the fabric of our society.
As young dynamic citizens of Kenya and as members of the African society, you would need to be watchful of those who spread radical ideologies.
And, be equally condemning of those who give shelter to terrorists and use them as political instruments.
Youth can also play an important role in building a counter narrative to extremist ideologies.
As two maritime trading nations, and as members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association, we also need to stand guard against sea borne threats.
And, ensure that piracy does not threaten our trade and safety of our seafarers, and there is freedom of navigation for all.
On way to Kenya, I had also visited Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania.
Over millennia, the East Coast of Africa has had strong maritime links with India.
Today, the same eastern coast is facing a complex set of strategic and security challenges.
The entire domain of maritime and coastal security is therefore mature for deeper engagement between our two countries.
This is the age of inter-dependence;
In this world of growing opportunities and complex challenges, you would inherit its tomorrow.
And, shape the future of this great country.
It has been a privilege speaking to you.
I am grateful to the University of Nairobi, its faculty and most of all you the future of Kenya, its students, for this opportunity.
In course of the interaction, the Prime Minister appreciated the work done by the Secretaries over the last year and a half.
He said that the vast expertise of the Secretaries in various domains of the governance, should now be leveraged to bring about “breakthroughs, rather than incremental change.”
The Prime Minister exhorted Secretaries to come up with ideas for transformative change in areas such as good governance, employment generation, education and health, farmer-centric initiatives, innovative budgeting, accelerated inclusive growth, Swachh Bharat and Ganga rejuvenation; and energy efficiency.
The Prime Minister emphasized that in each of these areas, the focus should be on measures which will transformatively improve the lives of people.
He laid stress on people’s participation in governance, and empowerment of the common man.
Sushma Swaraj and Shri Nitin Gadkari were present.
Senior officers of Cabinet Secretariat and PMO were also present.
I thank Excellency Ghani for accepting my invitation and for gracing this conference.
It is also a great privilege for me to welcome all of you in Amritsar, a city blessed with simplicity, beauty and spirituality, and abode to the Golden Temple, the holiest shrines of Sikhs.
It is a place made sacred by Sikh Gurus who meditated here.
It embodies peace and humanism, and is open to all people and religions.
Its streets and parks tell stories of great valour and immense sacrifice.
It is a city whose character has been shaped by proud patriotism and generous philanthropy of its residents.
And, by their spirit of enterprise, creativity and hard work.
Amritsar also happens to nurture an old and steadfast connection of warmth and affection with Afghanistan.
Among the earliest disciples of the first Guru of Sikhs, Baba Guru Nanak Dev ji, were Afghans he had preached to in Kabul in the 15th century.
Even today, the shrine of an Afghan-origin sufi saint Baba Hazrat Sheikh in Punjab is revered by all faiths, including visitors from Afghanistan.
The flow of trade, people and ideas through our region has often intersected in Amritsar on one of Asia’s oldest and longest surface arteries, the Grand Trunk Road.
Amritsar reinforces the value of restoring connectivity which is so crucial for the overall growth, stability and economic prosperity of Afghanistan.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Since the turn of this century, the international community has extensively engaged in Afghanistan.
Major powers, regional countries and concerned nations from around the world have cooperated through multiple programmes of political, social, military, economic, and developmental support.
Our gathering today re-affirms the commitment of the international community to durable peace and lasting political stability in Afghanistan.
Indeed, this is also the intent of this conference, aptly captured in its theme, “Addressing challenges; Achieving prosperity”.
We have no doubt about the scale of the challenge.
But, we are equally determined to succeed.
The results of our collective efforts thus far have been hard-won, but mixed.
There have been important successes.
Much more remains to be done.
The need of the hour is to stand our ground and continue with our line of effort.
We must protect and build on the gains of the last fifteen years and march ahead.
Because, at stake is not just the future of Afghanistan that has invested in a vision of development, democracy, and pluralism.
But, the peace and stability of this entire region, and beyond.
Let us also reflect with urgency on what more must be done and what we must avoid in Afghanistan so that its citizens can self-sustain peace and economic growth.
The answers are all there.
The question is of resolve and action.
And, of putting Afghanistan and its people first.
For this, First, an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process is key.
It is the only guarantor of durability of solutions.
Second, we must demonstrate strong collective will to defeat terror networks that cause bloodshed and spread fear.
Terrorism and externally induced instability pose the gravest threat to Afghanistan’s peace, stability and prosperity.
And, the growing arc of terrorist violence endangers our entire region.
As such, support for voices of peace in Afghanistan alone is not enough.
It must be backed by resolute action.
Not just against forces of terrorism, but also against those who support, shelter, train and finance them.
Silence and inaction against terrorism in Afghanistan and our region will only embolden terrorists and their masters.
Third, our bilateral and regional commitments of material assistance for Afghanistan’s development and humanitarian needs must continue and increase.
Our cooperative endeavours in Afghanistan should contribute to its infrastructure and institutional capacity, and self-propelling engines of growth.
Fourth,we should all work to build stronger positive connectivity between Afghanistan and other countries of the region.
On our part, we see Afghanistan as the hub for strengthening links of connectivity between South Asia and Central Asia.
We cannot deny that the more connected Afghanistan is with the regional arteries of trade, capital and markets, the more assured would be its economic growth and progress.
President Ghani and I have converged on the priority of strengthening trade and transport linkages with other partners in the region.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
And, the reach and benefit of such efforts extends to all corners of Afghanistan.
Herat’s India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam, also called the Salma Dam, that was launched a few months ago, will help revive economic activity for the people there.
The Parliament Building in Kabul represents our strong commitment to Afghanistan’s democratic future.
Zeranj-Deleram highway and India-Afghanistan-Iran cooperation on Chahbahar would enable Afghanistan to link its economy with centres of strong economic growth in South Asia and beyond.
We also plan to connect Afghanistan with India through an air transport corridor
President Ghani and I have discussed additional measures for deepening our bilateral cooperation.
It will extend to areas like water management, health, infrastructure, energy and skill development.
As India implements its additional commitments, we are open to work with other like-minded partners for the development of Afghanistan.
We are also happy to note the international commitments at the Brussels Conference in October and NATO’s Warsaw Summit in July this year.
We will continue efforts to scale up our ambition and dedication to assist Afghanistan.
In this, we draw upon lessons learned and best practices derived from our shared experience in working on projects.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen
Let us remember that every passing day we help Afghanistan to achieve successful political, security and economic transitions, we are also helping ourselves create a more peaceful region and world.
Let us re-dedicate ourselves to making Afghanistan a Geography of Peace.
A place where reason and peace succeeds; progress and prosperity prevails and democracy and plurality wins.

Talking to a small group of journalists, including from ET, the PM said Tuesday’s Cabinet changes are an “expansion” and not a “reshuffle”.
He was laying out his big ideas on governance.
“We are Indian in our approach but international in our outlook,” the PM said.
For me,success would mean that without my claiming things, people should experience the change.
That would be the correct yardstick.”
Modi also told ET that he’s in favour of holding Lok Sabha and assembly elections together so that the “Rajya Sabha will also be in tune”.
The prime minister’s point being that the Upper House, the composition of which is determined by the strength of various political parties in state assemblies, will better reflect popular mandate if all elections are held in one shot.
The PM’s backing of simultaneous Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha polls draws from an idea long championed by Bharatiya Janata Party.
That is why many people are calling for holding the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections simultaneously.”
On changes in his Cabinet, the PM said the exercise slated for Tuesday is “an expansion, not a reshuffle”.
The PM, answering ET’s question on the likelihood of parliamentary nod for the crucial GST Bill, said it will be “suicide” for any party to oppose GST.

We are honoured to be sitting in the same sanctum.
Today we share the same place of pride.
The front seats of this hall were ordained by the iconic national heroes like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Acharya Kripalani, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Sarojini Naidu.
The same House which once on 14 August, 1947, at the stroke of the midnight hour, witnessed the most pious moment of the nation attaining freedom!
Between many a great debates, agreements and disagreements, chalking a new path, adopting the middle path when they would go astray, was born the Indian Constitution!
It was an outcome of deliberations which lasted two years, eleven months and seventeen days when people from every part of the country participated in the brainstorming.
In a similar way, GST has been the result of a long drawn premeditated mentation of several years equally supported by State Governments.
When the Constitution was framed, it introduced a framework of equal opportunity and rights for all.
With the launch of GST, Team India has proven its potential and diligence.
This GST Council has developed such systems wherein the underprivileged gets all the promised facilities.
The people connected with GST have gone beyond politics and unanimously contributed to ensure welfare of the poor class.
Arun ji has acknowledged the contribution of all of them who walked the talk along with the government.
GST is in a way is like our railways with state and Centre playing equal role in its operations.
While it receives regional support at the state level, yet it is representative of the “Indian Railways”.
The Central Service officers are deputed all over the states and they align the state with the vision of the Centre.
GST is the first of its kind system in the country when both Centre and State shall be putting consolidated efforts in the same direction.
Today, GST Council had its 18th meeting and GST would be implemented in a short while from now.
It has been a long process.
Even if something is very difficult to be achieved, one can obtain it with penance and hard work.
Can we imagine, when we became independent there were more than 500 Princely states.
If it was not for Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel to integrate these Princely states, what would have been the political map of India today?
Just as Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel unified India by helping several princely states subsume into a common entity, the GST will bring economic unification.
If we take into consideration the 29 states, the 7 Union Territories, the 7 taxes of the Centre and the 8 taxes of the states, and several different taxes for different commodities, the number of taxes sum up to a figure of 500!
Today all those taxes will be shred off to have ONE NATION, ONE TAX right from Ganganagar to Itanagar and from Leh to Lakshadweep.
Once Albert Einstein, an eminent scientist had said that the most complex thing to understand in this world is Income tax.
I was wondering if he was present here then how he would have reacted looking at the plethora of taxes.
And we have seen that usually there is not much of a difference in the quantity of production.
But when the product goes out, we can see the inequality due to different tax regimes of different states.
The same product will have different prices in, say Delhi , Gurugram and Noida which are 25-30 kilometres apart.
This is because Haryana , Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have different tax regimes.
As a result of these variations, a citizen wonders that – if I go to Gurugram I get the product at one price, if I go to Delhi I get the same product for a different price and if I go to Noida I get it for yet another price.
There was confusion in everybody’s mind.
The foreign investors used to be confused about different systems in different states.
Today we are moving ahead to get rid of that situation.
Arun Ji has vividly explained that once GST is in place, all sorts of taxes like sales tax, VAT etc. will cease to exist.
Long wait by vehicles at toll plazas will end.
Fuels worth crores of rupees are wasted.
And that causes damage to the environment as well.
Now we will be free from of all those troubles as the entire country will have a similar tax structure.
Sometimes certain items, especially the perishable ones that were supposed to reach their destination in time, were delayed because of the time taken for processing; and it resulted in losses at both ends.
Today we are getting rid of all that.
The country is moving a step forward towards a modern taxation system.
This is a system that is simpler, more transparent.
It will help us curbing black money and corruption and reward honesty.
It will generate interest and enthusiasm to do business honestly.
It will bring in a new culture of governance.
We have all lived tax terrorism and inspector raj.
Today, due to the transparency of GST, due to technologically proven trial, grey areas are ending.
GST has an inherent strength of eliminating the possibility of ordinary businessmen being harassed by the officers.
Traders with a turnover up to Rs. 20 lakh are totally exempt from this.
Traders with a turnover up to Rs. 75 lakh are also having many exemptions.
Friends, GST is not limited to the technicalities of the term.
In fact, the system is for the welfare of the poor.
Even after 70 years of independence, we have not been able to deliver to the poor.
It’s not that efforts were not made.
Every government has made tremendous efforts in this direction.
But somewhere the limited resources became a hurdle in the fulfillment of the needs of our country’s poor.
As we expand horizontally, we need to ensure vertical growth as well.
The work in that direction will become easier.
And I believe that small traders will definitely cooperate and allow the transfer of the benefits to the poor so that the poor is benefitted.
Sometimes we are apprehensive about starting anything new, whether it will work out or not.
For example when for the first time class 10th and 12th results went online, the system hung.
The next day the focus of the news was this very issue.
Even today we hear about such issues.
It is true that everyone is not tech-savvy.
However, if any household has a class 10th-12th student, he would definitely know about technology.
GST is so simple that a class 12 student can help merchants file returns.
I request those who have fears to dismiss them.
You get your eye check-up done by your regular doctor.
He gives you power for your eyes.
You get the spectacles made.
When you get those spectacles, it takes 2-3 days to get adjusted.
The crux of the story is that even then the eyes need to adjust to new spectacles.
Similarly, if we try to adjust to the new system we will definitely be able to integrate ourselves with it.
It is time to stop the rumour bazaar.
It is a time we concentrated on the development and for the betterment of this country.
Let the GST be carried forward till the point it has positive impact on the world’s economy.
GST is a system that ends the imbalances in the country’s trade.
It also boosts the exports of the country.
This system not only provides impetus to already developed states but also provides the opportunity to the backward states to develop.
They are all brimming with natural resources.
When they will get a single tax regime I can see clearly that whatever deficiency is there those will be removed and this art of the country will move ahead.
All the states of India will get equal opportunity for development.
GST is like our Railways.
Railway is run by the Centre and the states together.
Yet we look at it as Indian Railways.
Under GST, for the first time, the central and the state governments will work together towards the same direction.
This is an example of – ‘Ek Bharat Sreshtha Bharat’.
Its impact will be appreciated by the forthcoming generations with a great pride.
In 2022, India will celebrate the Diamond Jubilee year of achieving Freedom.
We have embarked upon a journey to create a New India.
The New India which is the dream of our 1.25 billions Indians!
Therefore Ladies and Gentlemen, GST shall play a key role in helping us build the India of our dreams.
The last verse of Lokmanya Tilak’s “Gita Rahsaya” ideally encapsulates the essence of the way the GST team has strived to achieve it.
GST is the path breaking legislation for New India.
A revolutionary taxation system for the digital India.
GST is the taxation system of New India; of the Digital India.
GST is not just a tax reform, but it is a landmark step towards economic reforms.
Beyond the taxation revamp, it is also paving the way towards social reforms.
It is a vouchment for corruption free taxation system.
In legal parlance GST may be known as Goods and Services Tax.
But the benefits of GST will positively ensure it to be “Good and Simple Tax” for the citizens of India.
Good because it liberates us from layers of taxation, Simple because it is uniformly implemented pan India.
On this momentous occasion, I wish to acknowledge the role of the Honourable President who anchored the project concomitantly.
He has astutely engaged himself at every stage of the designing of this taxation reform and steered the team with his invaluable contribution towards this historical day.
His inspiration kept everyone enthused throughout the journey.
I am deeply indebted to him for his guidance and his august presence during the launch event of GST.
With new vigour and fervour we shall take the nation towards exemplary economic development.

Your Excellency President Michel Temer, Members of the media, Friends,
Though separated by geography, Brazil and India are natural partners linked by common values of democracy, rule of law and shared aspirations for development, peace and prosperity.
President Temer as a foremost constitutional expert understands and appreciates this well.
The world has changed in these ten years.
The bilateral relations between India and Brazil have grown for the better.
I warmly recall my visit to Brazil in 2014.
It was the first country I visited outside Asia after assuming office.
I felt the full warmth of our friends in Brazil towards India.
Excellency, India is the first country you have chosen for a bilateral visit outside Latin America since assuming your important new responsibility.
Your visit reflects the importance we attach to our bilateral relationship.
This was evident in our productive discussions this morning.
President Temer and I have reviewed the full range of bilateral cooperation.
Noting the potential for much more, we have agreed to scale up our engagement.
President Temer and I have just met with our CEOs to hear from them first hand.I am encouraged at the steps they are taking to advance pragmatic collaboration.
President Temer and I also agreed to intensify and strengthen our coordination in important international fora.
There is much that is common in our approach and positions.
We will work closely at the United Nations, the G-20, G-4, WTO, BRICS, IBSA and other important platforms.
We thank Brazil for understanding India’s aspiration for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group.
Excellency and Friends,
As they say in Portuguese “A uniao faz a forca” – ‘our union makes us stronger’.
The Prime Minister fondly recalled his own visit to UK in November 2015, and the visit of Prime Minister Theresa May to India in November 2016.
The Prime Minister also said that India and UK are natural partners in the global fight against terrorism, and urged the Parliamentarians to continue to raise their collective voice against terrorism, extremism and radicalization.
He said that how long our life is, is not in our hands, but we can determine ‘how’ our life will be.
He said that Atal ji showed through his life, how life should be, and what its purpose should be.
He said Atal ji lived for the countrymen, for his principles, and for the aspirations of the common man.
The Prime Minister noted that Vajpayee ji spent most of his political life at a time when there was virtually no alternative to the dominant political ideology.
He said that despite facing isolation, he remained committed to his ideals.
He stayed in opposition for so long, yet his ideals remained untouched, the Prime Minister said.
Shri Narendra Modi said that Vajpayee ji respected Parliamentary traditions; and when the opportunity came, he implemented his vision for the benefit of the people.
In each moment you could feel the “Atal” in him, the Prime Minister said.
He attributed the success of these tests, to the skill of our scientists.
And despite the widespread adverse reaction globally, Atal ji did not buckle under pressure, and showed the world that India is “Atal,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister recalled that when Atal ji first formed the Government at the Centre, no one was willing to offer support, and the Government fell in 13 days.
But Atal ji did not lose hope and remained committed to serving the people.
He showed the way when it came to coalition politics, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that Vajpayee ji changed the global narrative on Kashmir.
The Prime Minister said that Atal ji shall remain an inspiration.
He was away from public life and politics for over a decade; and yet there was such an outpouring of emotion at his passing.
This shows his greatness, the Prime Minister said.
What greater heights, and what greater success can a man achieve, the Prime Minister remarked.
“I am grieved by the loss of lives caused due to cloudburst and heavy rain in parts of Uttarakhand.
I hope normalcy returns to the rain-affected areas at the earliest”, the Prime Minister said.
His unflinching courage and righteousness continue to inspire every Indian”, the Prime Minister said.
The plan aims to make India disaster resilient and reduce loss of lives
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today released the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP).
This is the first ever National plan prepared in the country.
It aims to make India disaster resilient and significantly reduce the loss of lives and assets.
The plan is based on the four priority themes of the “Sendai Framework,” namely: understanding disaster risk, improving disaster risk governance, investing in disaster risk reduction (through structural and non-structural measures) and disaster preparedness, early warning and building back better in the aftermath of a disaster.
Salient Features of the Plan
The plan covers all phases of disaster management: prevention, mitigation, response and recovery.
It provides for horizontal and vertical integration among all the agencies and departments of the Government.
The plan also spells out the roles and responsibilities of all levels of Government right up to Panchayat and Urban Local Body level in a matrix format.
The plan has a regional approach, which will be beneficial not only for disaster management but also for development planning.
It is designed in such a way that it can be implemented in a scalable manner in all phases of disaster management.
It also identifies major activities such as early warning, information dissemination, medical care, fuel, transportation, search and rescue, evacuation, etc. to serve as a checklist for agencies responding to a disaster.
It also provides a generalized framework for recovery and offers flexibility to assess a situation and build back better.
“Commendable gesture Anupam ji.
Excellent effort by noted actor @Mohanlal.
Wonderful initiative by @indiatvnews.
This will further spread the message of cleanliness across the nation.
I congratulate @SadhguruJV & the team of Isha Foundation for their exemplary effort to generate awareness on keeping our rivers clean.
Appreciable message by the Indian Cricket Team on making India Clean.
Good effort Rajeev ji.
The Prime Minister will also visit Vijay Ghat to offer floral tributes to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri on his birth anniversary.
At this event, the Prime Minister will visit a mini Digital Exhibition.
The Swachh Bharat Awards will also be distributed on this occasion.
The exhibition has around 30 exhibits, and features about 20 different kinds of interactive and media experiences.
It provides visitors with a range of opportunities to engage with various digital installations which explain the role of Sardar Patel in the unification of India.
Technologies like 3D films (without glasses), Holographic Projection, Kinetic Projection, Oculus based Virtual Reality experience etc have been used in the exhibition.
The relevant documentation has been sourced by the Ministry of Culture, from the National Archives of India.
The design of the exhibition has been conceptualized by the National Institute of Design.
The exhibition will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister on October 31, 2016 – the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
The Premiers of Ontario and the Prince Edward Island expressed deep appreciation and support for the initiatives launched by the Government of India, including in the fields of manufacturing, skill, infrastructure development, renewable energy, urban renewal, waste management, education, agriculture.
They conveyed that over the past year, the Canadian businesses and investors, including various Canadian Pension Funds, have shown enhanced interest and confidence in India.
This was evident from a strong participation from Canada in the India investment Summit being held on 4-5 February 2016 in New Delhi.
Prime Minister mentioned that India attached high priority to its relations with Canada.
His own visit to Canada in April 2015, which was the first bilateral visit of the Prime Minister from India after a gap of nearly 42 years, and subsequent developments in bilateral relations have highlighted the synergy and complementarities between the two countries in various fields.
Prime Minister conveyed his warm greetings to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and expressed confidence that his visit to India later this year would provide an opportunity to further deepen the strategic partnership between the two countries.
The two leaders took positive note of growing bilateral cooperation in defence, counter-terrorism and energy and coordination on regional and global issues.
They agreed to continue to work together for further strengthening India-U.S. bilateral relations in 2019.
The Prime Minister said that the tradition of Sufism has kept evil at bay, wherever it has continued to flourish.
Out of the 31 Satellites, 28 belonging to 6 other countries are carried by today’s launch”, the Prime Minister said.
Referring to the recent terror attacks in Brussels, the Prime Minister said that Brussels shows us how real and immediate is the threat to nuclear security from terrorism.
Third, state actors working with nuclear traffickers and terrorists present the greatest risk.
Noting that terror has evolved and terrorists are using 21st century technology, the Prime Minister observed that our responses are rooted in the past.
He said terrorism is globally networked, but we still act only nationally to counter this threat.
He added that the reach and supply chains of terrorism are global, but genuine cooperation between nation states is not.
The Prime Minister said that without prevention and prosecution of acts of terrorism, there is no deterrence against nuclear terrorism.
He urged everyone to drop the notion that terrorism is someone else’s problem and that “his” terrorist is not “my” terrorist.
The Prime Minister said nuclear security must remain an abiding national priority, and all States must completely abide by their international obligations.
Monsoon Session: Respect for the time, resources and dignity of the Parliament
• Monsoon Session of the parliament gets underway tomorrow.
The need of the hour is to ensure that we make maximum use of the time in this session.
Barring a few exceptions, there has been a considerable increase in parliament productivity over the past three years.
My thanks to all the political parties for this.
All political parties must co-operate in this regard.
• The budget session was convened was convened about a month ago.
All political parties extended their co-operation.
• A major impact of advancing the budgetary process by a month has been that the funds allotted to several departments for various schemes reached before the monsoon season.
Earlier, it used to take two to three months for the funds allocated to the schemes to reach up to the departments.
The implementation was delayed due to the monsoon.
It did not happen this time and there has not been any lag period after March.
It has also provided three months additional time for the completion of infrastructure projects.
• According to the estimates from Controller General of Accounts, the expenditure in April-June this year has been 30% more than the same time previous year.
• The trend of expenditure in the schemes reflects that the funds allocated would be spent in a balanced manner throughout the year.
Earlier, the expenditure used to begin after the monsoon and unnecessary pressure was there to spend the money before March.
It was one of the reasons for the faults in the system.
Floods in North Eastern States
• Incessant rains in many parts of the country and the floods in the north eastern states has been a cause of concern.
Centre is in constant touch with the state governments and the situation is being closely monitored.
Many Central Government agencies are engaged in flood rescue and relief operations.
State Governments have been told to inform urgently whenever they need any assistance.
Tough on terrorism
• Entire nation has been in a state of shock in the wake of the attack on Amarnath pilgrims by the terrorists.
My heartfelt condolences to the pilgrims who were killed in this attack and my sympathies are with the families in this hour of grief.
The Government will ensure that the perpetrators of this attack are brought to book.
• We are fully committed to maintain peace in Jammu and Kashmir and to wipe out the anti national elements from the state.
The Government is trading the path laid down by Atal ji.
• Some anti social elements have incited violence in the name of cow protection.
Those engaged in disturbing the harmony in the country are trying to take advantage of the situation.
• It has an impact on the image of the nation.
State Governments must deal sternly against such anti-social elements.
Public sentiments are attached with the cow.
However, people must know that there is a law to protect the cow and the violation of law is not an alternative.
• Maintaining law and order is the responsibility of State Governments and wherever these incidents are taking place, state Governments must deal firmly with it.
The State Governments must also see to it that in the name of cow protection some people are settling their personal rivalry.
• All the political parties should condemn strongly this goondaism in the name of cow protection.
• Over the past few decades, the image of political leadership has been at crossroads due to the deeds of some of the leaders amongst us.
We need to convince the people that every leader is not tainted and every leader is not only running after money.
• What is required that we have to be transparent in our public life and yet there should be action against corrupt leaders.
• 75th anniversary of uit India Movement falls on 9th August .
Parliament should discuss it.
• It would have been better had the Presidential election been held by consensus.
However, it is a matter of satisfaction and pride that the election campaign has been a dignified one.
All the political parties need to be congratulated.
All parties must train their MPs and MLAs to cast their votes so that not a single vote is wasted.
Urges People To Share Their Photos Of Northeast Visits
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi praised the spectacular beauty of the Northeast.
He asked, “Do you have pictures of your own Northeast visits or glimpses of the spectacular natural beauty of the region?”
He requested the people to share them on Instagram using #MagnificentNortheast.
I warmly welcome you all to India and to Delhi.
Delhi is a city with a rich heritage, and has several historical landmarks.
I hope you will have time to see some of them.
Madam Lagarde, this event is another example of your fondness for India and Asia.
I congratulate you on being appointed as Managing Director for a second term.
This reflects the confidence the world has in your understanding of the global economy, and your ability to lead this institution.
Madam Lagarde, the long pending quota revisions agreed in 2010 have finally come into effect.
You have demonstrated exceptional leadership, in managing the tensions that emerged due to the delay.
You played a major role in finally persuading all members to ratify the decisions taken in 2010.
I am sure, the IMF will be able to build on this success.
Reform of global institutions has to be an on-going process.
India has always had great faith in multi-lateralism.
We believe that as the world becomes more complex, the role of multilateral institutions will increase.
Our ties, therefore, are more than seventy years old.
We are a Founding Member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank.
We are confident that these banks will play an important role in the development of Asia.
The Fund has built up an immense stock of economic expertise.
All its members should take advantage of this.
All of us need to pursue policies that provide a stable macro economy, enhance growth and further inclusion.
The Fund can be of great assistance in this.
Apart from advice, the IMF can help in building capacity for policy making.
We have agreed to set up the South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Centre.
The centre will provide training to government and public sector employees.
It will enhance their skills and improve the quality of their policy inputs.
It will also provide technical assistance to governments and public institutions.
Let me now turn to the theme of this conference.
Many knowledgeable people have said that the twenty first century is, and will be, the Asian Century.
Three out of every five people in the world live in Asia.
Its share in global output and trade is now close to one-third.
Its share in global foreign direct investment is about forty percent.
It has also been one of the world’s most dynamic regions.
Although Asia has slowed down, it is still growing at a rate three times greater than that of the advanced countries.
It is, therefore, the ray of hope for global economic recovery.
When we think about Asia, we must recognize that it is distinct in many ways.
For example, the theme of this conference is ‘Investing for the Future’.
Asian Families tend naturally to save more than people in other parts of the world.
Thus they invest for the future.
Economists have commented on the savings ethic of Asian countries.
Asians tend to save to buy a house, rather than borrow to buy a house.
Many Asian countries have relied more on developmental financial institutions and banks than on capital markets.
This provides an alternative model for the financial sector.
Social stability built on strong family values is another feature of Asia’s development.
Asians tend to leave things behind for the next generation.
Madam Lagarde, you are one of the world’s top women leaders.
You will be interested in another unique feature of Asia which is rarely commented upon: which is, the large number of women leaders.
Asia has done so to a much greater degree than other continents.
Today, four large states of India – West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan – are headed by democratically elected women.
The Speaker of the Lower House of Parliament in India is also a woman.
India has a special place in Asia.
It has historically contributed to Asia in several ways.
Buddhism spread to China, Japan, and other parts of South East Asia from India.
It has had a lasting influence on the continent’s culture.
Kingdoms in the South and West of India have engaged in maritime trade with other parts of Asia for over a thousand years.
The Indian national movement showed other Asian countries that freedom from colonial rule could be achieved without violence.
It also demonstrated clearly that the sense of nationhood, could be broad and inclusive.
It need not be defined by narrow linguistic or religious identities.
The Sanskrit saying “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – the world is one family – refers to this sense of the oneness of all identities.
India has dispelled the myth that democracy and rapid economic growth cannot go together.
India’s growth rate of over seven per cent is being achieved in a country that is also a vibrant democracy.
It is sometimes assumed that democracy is a colonial gift to India.
But historians tell us that India had produced forms of democratic self governance, many centuries ago, when democracy was unknown in many parts of the world.
India has also shown that a large, diverse country can be managed in a way that can promote economic growth and maintain social stability.
One way in which we are doing this is through cooperative and competitive federalism.
The states and the Centre come together to pursue common objectives.
States which pursue good policies and deliver essential services for the poor, induce others to follow.
Our rapid economic growth is also very distinct in Asia.
We have never tried to gain in trade at the expense of our partners.
We do not follow “beggar thy neighbour” macro-economic policies.
We have never undervalued our exchange rate.
We add to world and Asian demand by running current account deficits.
We are therefore good Asian and good global economic citizens, and a source of demand to our trading partners.
We all want Asia to succeed.
I firmly believe that India can contribute to Asian prosperity and development by being economically strong.
Amid global problems, I am happy to say that India is a haven of macro-economic stability and a beacon of hope, dynamism and opportunity.
Madam Lagarde, you have referred to India as the “bright spot” in the global economy.
I view this as a great privilege and, at the same time, a major responsibility.
Let me outline our achievements in the last few months and our priorities for the period ahead.
We have achieved major gains in macro-economic stability.
A durable reduction in inflation, steady fiscal consolidation, a comfortable balance of payments position and build-up of foreign exchange reserves are the highlights.
We have improved our economic governance.
Corruption and interference in the decisions of banks and regulators are now behind us.
We undertook a highly successful financial inclusion programme, bringing over two hundred million unbanked people into the banking system within a span of a few months.
Thanks to our financial inclusion programme, we now have the world’s largest and most successful programme of direct benefit transfers, in cooking gas.
We plan to extend it to other sectors such as food, kerosene, and fertilizers.
This has improved targeting and the quality of public expenditure.
We have opened up nearly all sectors of our economy to FDI.
I am very happy to note that all our colleagues have expressed one voice and one sentiment.
Today, when we talk of Jammu & Kashmir, we should talk about four parts of the State of Jammu & Kashmir: Jammu, Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
I am thankful to leaders of all political parties for the concerns they have expressed about the current situation in parts of Jammu & Kashmir.
The rich traditions nurtured by our democracy for last six decades have been the biggest strength of unity and integrity of our country.
We may have some differences on some issues but when it comes to the integrity and sovereignty of the country, we all stand united.
Like every Indian, I have been deeply hurt by the recent incidents in Jammu & Kashmir.
It is very sad to see that children are not able to study, apple produce is not able to reach the mandis, shopkeepers are not getting their daily income and Government offices are not able to work for the service of the people.
The poor are the worst affected by this situation.
We are committed to provide the best healthcare services to the injured; we want to restore peace in the Valley at the earliest possible so that people can lead their normal life, can earn their livelihoods, send their children to school and sleep peacefully at night.
We are committed to a permanent and peaceful solution to the issue of Jammu & Kashmir in accordance with the basic principles of the Constitution.
We have an open mind and our doors are always open.
We are committed to the welfare of every citizen of the entire State of Jammu & Kashmir.
Jammu & Kashmir is often called the crown of India.
In fact, Jammu & Kashmir is a symbol of the age old commitment of equanimity towards all creeds (sarv-panth sambhaav), where Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Muslims have been living together for centuries.
The state of Jammu & Kashmir is the symbol of our founding fathers’ faith which defines us as Indian in spite of our diversity.
Jammu & Kashmir is not only a matter of our territorial integrity but also defines our nationhood.
Statistics reveal that security personnel have been injured in large numbers.
Despite false propaganda by certain elements in Kashmir, the percentage of those spreading confusion and unrest; and those instigating youth is very low.
Every Kashmiri wants peace, has faith in Democracy.
That is why, despite threats by separatist elements during every election, the Kashmiri people have expressed faith in the Indian democratic system in each election (festival of Indian democracy).
Even just prior to the recent disturbances, high votes were cast in the constituency of Chief Minister Mehbooba ji.
Therefore, to spread the myth that this is a public agitation is far from the truth.
In some areas certain restrictions were imposed in order to maintain law and order.
This is an administrative way of maintaining law and order.
Otherwise the lives of peace loving people will be affected adversely.
In reality, a common man was not troubled as much by such restrictions, as he was troubled by continuous strikes declared by separatist elements.
During this period, the Amarnath Yatra proceeded smoothly.
In addition, the State Government has taken up a number of initiatives on solar energy in the Ladakh region.
Since the start of Terrorist activities in Kashmir in 1989-1990, in action by the Security Forces:
• More than 34,000 AK 47 Rifles were seized.
• More than 5000 Grenade launchers were seized.
• Around 90 LMGs were seized.
• More than 12,000 Revolvers were seized.
• 3 Anti Tank Guns and 4 Anti Aircraft Guns were seized.
• More than 350 Missile Launchers were seized.
When weapons have been seized in such huge numbers, so many foreign terrorists have infiltrated to spread death and destruction, the world will never accept the false propaganda of Pakistan, even if it speaks a hundred thousand lies.
Pakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes.
The time has come when Pakistan shall have to answer to the world for the atrocities committed by it against people in Baluchistan and PoK.
We are fully committed to the fundamental rights of the people.
Our anti-terror laws are more humane than those of any other democracy in the world.
Our governments and our security forces have shown restraint in dealing with these incidents.
India will fight against terrorism with full might and resolve.
This is our national duty.
To consider India’s commitment to the Rule of Law, as a weakness, will be a mistake by our opponents.
India is committed to end terrorism.
For us, ‘means and ends’ are both important and we are sufficiently capable in both these regards.
It is also a fact that Kashmiri Pandits have been displaced from their centuries-old ancestral dwellings in Kashmir Valley.
Such atrocity against a particular community is the misdeed of terrorists trained and armed with weapons by Pakistan, and their sympathizers.
These can never be the deeds of those who believe in “Kashmiriyat.”
For the all round development of Jammu and Kashmir, a decision has been taken for implementing a development package of more than Rs. 80 thousand crore (800 billion rupees) in consultation with the State Government.
This package not only has proposals for roads and electricity projects, it actually envisages development of every region and every section of society of Jammu and Kashmir.
This includes better facility for education of children, employment to youths, modern facility for treatment, facilities for promotion of tourism in the state and special arrangements for production of fruits in the State.
In addition, about 1 lakh 25 thousand (125,000) persons will be trained under Udaan and HIMAYAT schemes so that unemployed people can get appropriate employment.
During the last one month, the Government has tackled the situation very carefully in spite of extremely adverse circumstances.
The whole nation stands with her.
I would like to reiterate that the Central and State Governments are committed to address the people’s genuine grievances and restore peace in the state.
We will deal strictly with acts of violence, terrorism and anti India activities.
At the same time, genuine grievances of every person will be heard and addressed.
I would like to reiterate that all the political parties and all Indians will have to stand united in the fight against terrorism and destructive forces.
At a time when terrorism is spreading its wings across the world, and terrorism is being instigated by our neighbour, we will have to fight this battle unitedly.
The government has an expectation of constructive cooperation from all political parties in this matter.
All political parties will have to bury their differences and cooperate to restore peace and prosperity in the state.
I fully believe that with the active efforts of the state government and with your full cooperation, we will be able to restore normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir very soon.
I would like to reiterate our main steps and our policy in respect of Kashmir:
1) It is the duty of any Government to maintain law and order.
There will be no compromise with terrorism.
2) In today’s age, in accordance with democratic traditions, we will encourage involvement of civil society with citizen activities.
3) We will take forward the political process, in accordance with democratic traditions.
4) The process of connecting Kashmiri youth with economic activities of the State will be speeded up.
6) Ministry of External Affairs should make efforts to approach the people of PoK residing in different parts of world and collect information about the miserable conditions in PoK and bring them to the knowledge of the world community.
I once again thank you all for giving your important views and suggestions in this meeting.
I thank you all for supporting the Government.
We all are committed to this national spirit that there cannot be any compromise on India’s territorial integrity.
We are ready to address grievances of all sections within the framework of the Constitution.
And, Excellency, your personal attention and leadership has contributed much to the steady direction, strength and vibrancy in our ties.
Your contributions have been instrumental in forging a wide-ranging Strategic Partnership with India.
Our links with Malaysia have been civilizational and historic.
The contributions of a large Indian community in Malaysia are of special value.
Malaysian companies are participating in many of our infrastructure projects across different states in India.
We are also converging efforts aimed at food security that are linked to the wellbeing of our farmers.
The signing today of the MOU on Mutual Recognition of Degrees is a landmark development that will benefit the students and societies of both our countries.
Excellency, your own leadership in countering radicalization and terrorism is an inspiration for the entire region.
Excellency Prime Minister Najib,
I am confident that our decisions today will drive our strategic partnership to the next level.
I wish you an enjoyable and fruitful stay in India.
Both the countries desire to further strengthen cooperation in fighting international criminality and serious organized crime.
The MoU will reinforce the collaboration in the field of security that will be mutually beneficial.
“Deeply saddened by the loss of lives and devastation due to tsunami and earthquake in Central Sulawesi in Indonesia.
I offer deepest condolences.
India stands with its maritime neighbour in this difficult hour”, the Prime Minister said.
The country must be watching this event on T.V. and wondering that they are the same Parliamentarians whom they see during the day.
Even the Vice President and the Speaker Madam must be really delighted to be a witness to this event as everyone is calm and composed.
I hope that such a scenario will also exist in both the houses of the Parliament and may we and our Parliamentarians who are associated with the sorrows of the common man, get the opportunity to speak.
The government must be compelled to prioritize their issues.
The voices of the poor, the villages and the forests must reach the government through these Parliamentarians in such a way that the government too is compelled to empathize with their feelings and work towards addressing those issues.
Unfortunately, that opportunity of a Parliamentarian is often lost.
He must have attained his field of perfection with a lot of hard work.
He is definitely rich in terms of the work done; he is an authority in his own field.
However, because of pandemonium, chaos and noise the government per se is not that much affected as much as the country is.
It also does tremendous amount of damage to the representatives who have come here after a lot of hardwork and struggle to speak about the problems of the people but are not given the opportunity to speak.
Therefore, it is also a loss of that region and the local people of that region to which he belongs.
The chaos is shown on the T.V. for a few minutes or an hour or for the entire day.
Thereafter, it ends.
But, the MP who gets the opportunity to speak, even if he launches a scathing attack on the government, even if he has points to make, his words become a part of the history.
It’s the responsibility of everyone to ensure that the words of every Parliamentarian go on record.
It’s the responsibility of all of us to ensure that the issues related to the villages, poor and farmers, spoken by the Parliamentarians must compel the government to take action.
We can create such a scenario in the House.
The better the atmosphere is, stronger will be the force to carry our nation ahead.
Therefore, it is not easy to be a Parliamentarian.
They carry the dreams of 125 crore Indians and the resolutions of the people of their region and with the promise of a bright future.
Among those who have got the opportunity to accomplish that task are being honoured today.
When our colleagues are honoured, we feel proud that we work with such colleagues.
We feel proud that we areco-workers; we are the Parliamentarians in the same time period.
It is a matter of immense pride and prestige for us.
I once again congratulate you all from the core of my heart and my best wishes are with you.
Thanks a lot!

Honourable Jayalalithaa ji, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,
My Dear Friends.
Today is indeed a special day.
Today, Excellency Putin and I have the honour to dedicate Kudankulam nuclear power plant unit-1.
I am particularly grateful to President Putin for his presence at this event.
And, I am delighted that Jayalalithaa ji, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu is also present with us on this occasion.
In dedicating Kudankulam 1, we mark another historic step in India-Russia relations.
Its successful completion is not just another fine example of the strength of our special and privileged Strategic Partnership.
It is also a celebration of our abiding friendship.
And, it is only a start of our collaboration in this field.
It is perhaps not commonly known that at 1000 Mega Watt, Kudankulam 1 is the largest single unit of electrical power in India.
In years ahead, we are determined to pursue an ambitious agenda of nuclear power generation.
At Kudankulam alone, five more units of 1000 Mega Watt each are planned.
In our journey of cooperation, we plan to build a series of bigger nuclear power units.
Today’s event is also a joyful occasion for the team of Indian and Russian engineers, scientists and technicians.
We salute their dedication and hard work and congratulate them for the fruits of their labour.
The story of human development has been of wide spread technological advancement and growing economic prosperity.
But, as we all know, it has not been without burden on our environment.
I have a vision for India where achievements of our economic development are respectful to mother earth.
And, where the engines of our industrial growth are increasingly driven by clean energy.
Above all, it showcases your personal commitment, consistent support and strong leadership in transforming the substance and character of our relationship.
For this, I am grateful to you Mr. President.
It is, therefore, only fitting that today we join together to dedicate the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit-1 to the strength and vigour of our friendship and cooperation.
Long live Indo-Russian friendship!
I once again thank you Excellency Putin for joining me in this dedication.
Also, my sincere thanks to Jayalalithaa ji for being with us.

India and Kenya fought together against colonialism.
Just last month, President Kenyatta recognized the contribution of Makhan Singh, an Indian born trade union leader, joining hands with his Kenyan brothers to help overthrow the colonial order in Kenya.
Common belief in democratic values, our shared developmental priorities and the warm currents of the Indian Ocean bind our societies.
In our discussions today, President and I reviewed the full range of our relationship.
During my visit to Kenya last year, we had identified deepening of economic cooperation as one of the key focus areas of our efforts.
In this context, expansion of bilateral trade, greater flow of capital between two economies, and stronger developmental partnership are a priority.
Yesterday, President Kenyatta led a strong and high level delegation to the eighth Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit.
Your participation in Vibrant Gujarat has generated a strong interest in Indian businesses to connect with commercial and investment opportunities in Kenya.
We want, and will encourage, industry and business in both countries to take lead in exploiting opportunities in healthcare, tourism, information technology, agriculture, blue economy and energy.
The Joint Business Council meeting tomorrow will work to build commercial engagement through specific projects in these areas.
To boost trade, we are also cooperating on trade facilitation measures, including standardization and related areas.
Broad based and wide ranging cooperation in agriculture and food security is our shared priority.
We are collaborating to raise agricultural productivity in Kenya.
The Line of Credit Agreement of $100 million signed for agricultural mechanisation today would open a new dimension of engagement.
Long term arrangement with Kenya for production and import of pulses is being explored and discussed.
We would also be happy to share best practises in organic farming with Kenyan farmers.

Some of the specific areas of priority would be hydrography, communications networks, anti-piracy, capacity building, exchanges and defence medical cooperation.
We are also partnering to strengthen our security cooperation and capacities.
The large Indian-origin community of Kenya is a vital and energetic link between us.
I have discussed with President Kenyatta ways to engage them with our trade, investments and cultural exchanges.
In our meeting last year, President and I had also agreed to accord close and personal supervision of the implementation of our decisions.
We need to ensure its continuing rigour .
Once again, on behalf of the people of India and on my own behalf, I thank you for accepting our invitation and honouring us with your presence, both in Gujarat and in Delhi.

Shri Ramnath Kovind, Governor of Bihar,
Venerable MING KUANG SHI from Taiwan,
Venerable THICH THIEN TAM from Vietnam,
Venerable TELO TULKU RINPOCHE from Russia,
Venerable Banagala Upatissa from Sri Lanka,
Venerable LAMA LOBZANG,
My Ministerial colleague Shri Kiren Rijiju,
Minister Lyonpo Namgay Dorji of Bhutan,
Minister Bayarsaikhan of Mongolia,
After Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, I have the opportunity to visit this sacred place.
I am meeting you all on a very special day.
Today, we in India are observing Teachers’ Day, to commemorate the birth anniversary of our 2nd President, a great scholar and teacher, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.
In this symposium we have been talking about one of the most impactful teachers in world history, Gautama Buddha.
His teachings have inspired millions of people over centuries.
Today, we are also celebrating Janmashtami, the day Lord Krishna was born.
The world has so much to learn from Lord Krishna.
When we talk about Lord Krishna we say, श्री कृष्णम वंदे जगतगुरुम -Shri Krishna, the teacher of all teachers; the Guru of all Gurus.
Both, Gautama Buddha and Lord Krishna have taught the world so much.
The themes of this conference, in a way are inspired by the values and ideals given by these two greats.
These two divine souls had the strength to bring people together, rising above differences.
Their teachings are most practical, eternal and are more relevant in this day and age than ever before.
The place where we are meeting makes it even more special.
We are meeting in Bodh Gaya, a land that has a distinctive place in the history of humankind.
This is the land of enlightenment.
Years ago, what Bodh Gaya got was Siddhartha but what Bodh Gaya gave to the world was Lord Buddha, the epitome of knowledge, peace and compassion.
This is, therefore the ideal venue for a dialogue and meeting here on the auspicious day of Janmashtami and the special day of Teachers’ Day makes this unique.
It was my great privilege to have participated in the Inaugural function of the first International Hindu Buddhist Initiative on “Conflict Avoidance and Environmental Consciousness” hosted by the Vivekananda International Foundation and Tokyo Foundation with the support of the International Buddhist Confederation at Delhi day before yesterday.
The Conference was conceptualised on shifting the paradigm from conflict resolution to conflict avoidance and from environmental regulation to environmental consciousness.
I had shared some of my thoughts on the two critical themes which are threatening humanity as no other challenge before.
I recalled how in the context of both issues and for changing the global paradigm of thinking the world is looking to the Buddha today as conflict resolution mechanisms and environmental regulations — both of them dependent on the instrumentality of nation states — are increasingly failing to measure up to challenges.
Spiritual and religious leaders and also intellectuals, largely from Buddhist societies participated in the two day conference and deliberated on the two issues.
At the end of the two day conference, and after a churning in which spiritual, religious and intellectual leaders participated, the Tokyo Foundation has announced that they have decided to hold a similar conference in January 2016.
And other Buddhist nations have also offered to hold similar conferences in their countries.
This is an extraordinary development which coincides with the rise of Asia as an economic and civilisational phenomenon.
The themes of the conference, informed and shaped by the Hindu-Buddhist civilisational and cultural perspectives, promise to deepen the notion of conflict avoidance philosophy and environmental consciousness in Asia and beyond.
The two day conference seems to have arrived at a broad consensus on both issues.
On the issue of conflicts — most of which are being driven by religious intolerance — the participants in the conference seem to have agreed that while there is no problem about the freedom to practise one’s religion, it is when the radical elements try to force their own ideologies on others, that the potential for conflict arises.
On the issue of environment, the conference seems to have agreed that the philosophic underpinning of the Dharma, which stresses the protection of natural heritage, is critical for sustainable development.
I may add that the United Nations too has arrived at the view that sustainable development is achievable only through aligning development to the local culture of the people.
This, in my view, is a positive turn in the development modelling of the world of diversity.
I may add that the turn in thinking at the global level has created the eco-system for the Hindu-Buddhist societies to carry forward their consensual ideas to the global fora.
I personally consider the Hindu Buddhist Conference on Conflict Avoidance and Environmental Consciousness as an important development in a world that seems to be short of durable ideas on both issues.
Hindu philosophy was one of the greatest beneficiaries of the advent and the teachings of the Lord Buddha.
Many scholars have analysed the impact of Buddha on Hinduism.
In fact, Adi Sankara was even critiqued for the way he was influenced by the Buddha and Sankara was called as “Prachhanna Boudha” — meaning Sankara was Buddha in disguised form.
That was the extent of influence of the Buddha on Adi Sankara, regarded by many as the tallest Hindu philosopher.
At the mass level Buddha was so venerated that Jayadeva in his Geeta Govinda even praised him as Mahavishnu or God himself who descended to preach Ahimsa.
So, Hinduism after the Buddha’s advent became Buddhist Hinduism or Hindu Buddhism.
They are today an inseparable amalgam.
Buddha never bowed down to anything, neither Veda, nor caste, nor priest, nor custom.
He fearlessly reasoned so far as reason could take him.
Such a fearless search for truth and such love for every living thing the world has never seen.
Buddha was more brave and sincere than any teacher.
Buddha was the first human being to give to this world a complete system of morality.
He was good for good’s sake, he loved for love’s sake.
Buddha was the great preacher of equality.
Every man and woman has the same right to attain spirituality— that was his teaching.
I would personally call India Buddhist India as it has imbibed all the values and virtues of the teachings of Buddha by their religious scholars incorporating them in their literature.
When this highest tribute is paid by one of the great Hindu philosophers would it be wrong to call today’s Hinduism in quality and substance as Buddhist Hinduism?
Buddha is the crown jewel of the Indian Nation which accepts all ways of worship of all religions.
The Enlightenment which Buddha attained in Bodh Gaya also lit the light of enlightenment in Hinduism.
As the first Servant of this ancient nation I revere Buddha as a reformer of not only Hinduism but also the world, who has given all of us a new world view and vision which is critical for the survival of all of us and the entire world.
I recognise how Buddhists all over the world revere Bodh Gaya as a place of pilgrimage.
We in India would like to develop Bodh Gaya so that it can become the spiritual capital and civilisational bond between India and the Buddhist world.
The government of India would like to provide all possible support that its Buddhist cousin nations need for the satisfaction of their spiritual needs from this holiest of holy places for them.
I am happy to read the Declaration of Buddhist Religions and Spiritual Leaders.
This declaration is the result of hardwork and extensive dialogue, which is why it is a pioneering document that will show us the way ahead.
I also echo Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who the other day highlighted the importance of tolerance, appreciation of diversity, and spirit of compassion and fraternity.
His message to this august gathering and his continuous support for furthering this initiative is a matter of great strength for us.
Once again, my congratulations and best wishes to you all.
This conference has raised a hope and urge to go beyond clash and create a dialogue framework for civilizational harmony and world peace.
I wish you well in your constant and determined efforts to ensure that our wisdom reaches the future generations and that too in a manner in which they can practically relate to.
This is essential not for us or them but for the progress of the entire human race and the beautiful surroundings which we have got from Mother Nature.
Thanks a lot.

Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation between Indian National Science Academy (INSA) and the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus
It is a great pleasure for me to welcome all of you on this 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Thousands of you have travelled from far-off lands to join us here today.
Millions more are connected through digital platforms.
We are celebrating this event in the beautiful city of Bengaluru.
Their achievements, the name they have earned in their own societies and globally, are a great inspiration for all of us.
It also reflects the success, glory and enterprise of Indian diaspora the world over.
There are over 30 million Overseas Indians living abroad.
Their footprint is all over the world.
But, Indians abroad are valued not just for their strength in numbers.
Friends, For my government and for me personally, engagement with the overseas Indian community has been a key area of priority.
I have met and spoken to hundreds of thousands of our brothers and sisters during my travels abroad – in USA, UK, Australia, South Africa, UAE, Qatar, Singapore, Fiji, China, Japan, South Korea, Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, Malaysia and other countries.
As a result of our sustained and systematic out-reach, there is new energy, keen desire and strong drive among Indian Diaspora to connect more extensively and deeply with India’s social and economic transformation The remittance of close to sixty nine billion dollars annually by the overseas Indians makes an invaluable contribution/ to the Indian economy.
NRIs and PIOs have made outstanding contributions to their chosen fields.
Among them, there are politicians of stature, scientists of repute, outstanding doctors, brilliant educationists, economists, musicians, famous philanthropists, journalists, bankers, engineers and lawyers.
And, sorry, did I mention our well known Information Technology professionals?
Tomorrow, 30 overseas Indians will receive from the President, the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards, which recognize contributions made by them in various fields, both in India and abroad.
Friends, Irrespective of their background and profession, the welfare and safety of all Indians abroad is our top priority.
Whether it is on loss of their passports, need for legal advice, medical assistance, shelter, or even transportation of mortal remains to India, I have directed all Indian embassies to be proactive to address problems of Indian nationals abroad.
Our response to the needs of the Indian nationals overseas is defined by Accessibility, sensitivity, speed and promptness.
24 by 7 help-lines by Indian Embassies; ‘Open House’ meetings with Indian nationals; consular camps; twitter seva for passport services; and use of social media platforms for immediate access; are some of the measures that we have put in place to convey a clear message that we are there for you when you need us.
The security of Indian nationals abroad is of utmost importance to us.
In situations of distress faced by Indian nationals, we have reached out to ensure their safety, rescue and repatriation.
Under Operation संकट मोचन in July 2016, we evacuated over one hundred and fifty Indian nationals from South Sudan within 48 hours.
Prior to that, we evacuated several thousands of our citizens from conflict situations in Yemen in well-coordinated, smooth and swift operations.
Through the Indian Community Welfare Fund we have assisted more than eighty thousand Indian nationals abroad/ who were in contingency situations.
Our aim is that for every Indian abroad, home should never be far away.
About six lakh emigrants have been granted Emigration Clearance online for overseas employment through registered recruitment agents.
Online registration of foreign employers on e-Migrate portal has been made mandatory.
And, the grievances, complaints and petitions of the Indian migrant workers continue to be addressed online through e-Migrate and MADAD platforms.
We are also taking strict action against illegal recruitment agents in India.
Prosecution sanctions by CBI or State Police against illegal agents; and increase in the amount of Bank Guarantee deposited by the recruiting agents from Rs.20 lakhs to Rs.50 lakhs; are some of the steps in this direction.
We acknowledge their concerns and have made efforts to address these issues.
I am glad to announce that starting with Mauritius, we are working to put in place new procedures and documentation requirements so that the descendants of Girmitiyas from this country could become eligible for OCI Cards.
We remain committed to addressing similar difficulties of PIOs in Fiji, Reunion Islands, Suriname, Guyana and other Caribbean States.
From first of January this year, beginning with airports in Delhi and Bengaluru, we have also set up special counters at immigration points in our airports for OCI Card holders.
Under the scheme an overseas Indian can work for one to three months in an institution in India.
Friends, It is my firm belief that connect between India and over-seas Indians should be sustained and enriching for both.
To meet this goal, in October last year,महात्मा गाँधी की जन्म दिवस पर, I had the honour of inaugurating the Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra in New Delhi.
This Kendra is dedicated to the over-seas Indian community.
We want it to become a symbol of the global migration, experiences, struggles, achievements and aspirations of the Indian Diaspora .
I am confident that the Kendra will become another important platform for crystallizing ongoing efforts of the government to redefine its engagement with the over-seas Indian community.
Last year, the first edition of the online quiz for young overseas Indians called “Bharat ko Jaano” saw participation of more than 5000 young NRIs and PIOs.
In the second edition this year, I hope to see the participation of at least fifty thousand young overseas Indians.
Investments by PIOs on non-repatriation basis; and by companies, trusts and partnerships owned by them, are now deemed to be domestic investment at par with investments made by resident Indians. हमारे कई ऐसा programs है,जैसे Swachh Bharat Mission, Digital India, Make in India and Start-up India, जिन से प्रवासी भारतीय भारत के सामान्य व्यक्ति के प्रगति से सीधा जुड़ सकते है.
There are some amongst you who would like to contribute in business and investments.
Others may feel more comfortable supporting through contributions made to Swachh Bharat, Namami Gange and others.
Some others may feel motivated to spare their valuable time and effort in volunteering in India helping the under-privileged or contributing to capacity building programs in various sectors.
We welcome all your efforts that seek to strengthen India’s partnership with the over-seas Indian community.
I also invite you to visit the exhibition in the PBD Convention which gives you a glimpse of some of the flagship programs that we have been implementing and see how you can partner with us.
And, no matter where we may be around the globe, it is in that common bond that we are strong.
Thank You and Jai Hind.

Konnichiva (Good Afternoon/Namaskar)
I’m delighted that I got the opportunity to welcome my unique friend, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in India, especially in Gujarat.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the Sabarmati Ashram with him.
Today both of us visited the Dandi Kutir.
This morning, together we carried out the ground-breaking ceremony of Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed railway project, which is being built with Japanese cooperation.
This is a very big step.
This is not just the beginning of high speed rail.
While looking forward at our future needs, I consider this new railway philosophy as the lifeline of a New India.
India’s uninterrupted progress has now been attached to a much faster pace.
Mutual trust and faith, understanding of each other’s interests and concerns, and continuous high level interactions, this is the uniqueness of Indo-Japan relations.
The scope of our special strategic and global partnership is not confined to bilateral or regional levels only.
We also have close cooperation on global issues.
Last year, during my visit to Japan, we had a historic agreement for peaceful use of nuclear energy.
I express my gratitude to the people of Japan, Parliament of Japan, and especially Prime Minister Abe for its ratification.
This agreement has added a new chapter to our cooperation on the issue of clean energy and climate change.
Now Japan is the third largest investor in India.
It clearly shows how much confidence and optimism is prevalent in Japan towards India’s economic development and a golden tomorrow.
And by looking at this investment, it can be assumed that in the coming days people-to-people ties between India and Japan will grow further along with a growing business.
At the same time, I would also request the Japanese business community to open more Japanese restaurants in India!
Today, India is on the path of a radical change at many levels.
Whether it is ease of doing business or Skill India, taxation reforms or Make in India, India is transforming completely.
This is a huge opportunity for Japanese businesses.
And I’m glad that many Japanese companies are deeply involved with our flagship programs.
We will also get to see its direct benefit during our conversation in today’s evening program with the business leaders of both the countries.
I am confident that our dialogue and the agreements signed by us today will further strengthen the partnership between India and Japan in all areas.
With these words, I once again warmly welcome Prime Minister Abe and the high level delegation accompanying him.
