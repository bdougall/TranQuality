The rationalization of Autonomous Bodies under Department of Health & Family Welfare will involve inter-ministerial consultations and review of existing bye laws of these bodies.
The time frame for implementation is one year,
Since the DoHFW provides funds to the hospitals, the grants can be given from the Department to the hospital directly.
RAN functions can, therefore, be vested in DoHFW.
Managing Committee of RAN Society will meet to dissolve the Autonomous Body (AB) as per provisions of Societies Registration Act, 1860 (SRA).
In addition to this, Health Minister’s Cancer Patient Fund (HMCPF) shall also be transferred to the Department.
The timeline required for this is one year.
Jansankhya Sthirata Kosh (JSK) was set up with a corpus grant of Rs.100 crores in the year 2003 to raise awareness for population stabilization strategies.
JSK organizes various activities with target populations as a part of its mandate.
There has been no continuous funding to JSK from the Ministry.
Although, JSK will continue to play a significant role in population stabilization strategies, its existence as an Autonomous Body is not necessary.
Hence, JSK as an Autonomous Body can be closed as it can be administered by the Department as a fund.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has addressed, through a video message, the special event in New York City, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
Following is the text of the PM’s address:-
President of ECOSOC, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I thank the President of ECOSOC for inviting me to address the special meeting today to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Economic and Social Council.
On this occasion, I extend my sincere greetings and congratulations to all members of United Nations.
To achieve a peaceful and prosperous world, we need to put in place, first and foremost, conditions for rapid socio-economic development; improvement in the human condition, and an end to hunger and deprivation.
India was a proud participant in the creation of this body.
The work of the ECOSOC therefore, particularly the manner in which it advances the improvement in the human condition and ensures a life of dignity for all, is central to the overall agenda of the United Nations.
70 years have passed since this body was created.
We are now 15 years into the 21st century.
But has the ECOSOC managed to fulfill the expectations of our founders?
While we have seen remarkable progress over these 70 years, eradication of poverty remains the greatest unfinished business of the 20th century.
It is also the most important unfulfilled objective of the United Nations.
The 70th anniversary of the ECOSOC could not have come at a more appropriate moment.
The international community has just given to itself a new comprehensive vision of development.
The ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, presents a valuable opportunity for the UN system to rethink its role and purpose, and make itself more effective.
It is now the responsibility of ECOSOC to rise up to this challenge and contribute to making this Agenda a success.
The 2030 Agenda is a reflection of the challenges faced by poorer countries.
We in the developing world not only have to end poverty and hunger and satisfy the legitimate aspirations of our people for a better life, we also have to do so in a manner that is friendly to the planet and environment.
The developed countries on the other hand, face enormous responsibilities to rapidly move their economies on to a sustainable path, follow sustainable lifestyles and assist developing countries with finance and technologies.
At the same time, we have enormous resources at our command.
And technology today presents us with solutions that were unthinkable earlier.
The challenge is to channel the available resources and use technology to tackle the most urgent problems facing us.
So long as there is poverty in the world, so long as our people, no matter in which country, remain deprived of basic human amenities, freedoms, rights and opportunities, the work of the ECOSOC will not be complete.
I am confident that ECOSOC will live up to the dreams of the founding fathers of the United Nations.
This objective is of particular significance for developing countries and emerging economies such as India, which is today the fastest growing large economy in the world.
As in the past, I look forward to the opportunity to meet leaders on the sidelines of the Summit to exchange views on bilateral matters of mutual interest”.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has invited everyone across the world to visit India, on the occasion of World Tourism Day.
This was followed by the advent of social media, and the mobile phone as an important vehicle of data storage and communication.
Expressions such as the Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, have now become commonplace.
These indicate that change continues, perhaps at an even faster pace now.
These rapid developments in the digital domain have mirrored immense change in India as well.
Indian IT talent has been recognized worldwide.
Indian IT companies have made a name for themselves globally.
Today, digital technology has emerged as a great enabler.
It has paved the way for efficient service delivery and governance.
It is improving access, in domains from education to health.
And it is helping to shape the future of business and economy.
Through each of these ways, it provides the less privileged sections of society, a more level playing field.
We believe it validates the Indian philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – the world is one family.
We in India, give primacy to the human face of technology, and are using it to improve what I call, “ease of living.”
Empowerment through digital access, is an objective that the Government of India is especially committed to.
“Digital India” is the world’s largest, technology-led transformative programme which is paving the way for our citizens to avail digital services.
We are using mobile power or M-power to empower our citizens.
I am sure most of you are already aware of Aadhaar, which is the unique biometric identity of a person.
Three factors: first, financial inclusion through our Jan-Dhan bank accounts; second, the Aadhaar platform; and third, the Mobile phone, have greatly helped reduce corruption.
We call this the J.A.M. or JAM trinity.
Through better targeting of subsidies, the JAM trinity has prevented leakages to the tune of nearly 10 billion dollars so far.
Today, a farmer can access a variety of services, such as soil-testing results, expert advice, and a good price for his produce, at the click of a button.
Digital technology is therefore contributing to increased farm incomes.
A small entrepreneur can register on the Government e-Marketplace, and bid competitively for supply of goods to the Government.
As he expands his business, he also contributes to lowering the cost of procurement for Government.
This leads to increased efficiency, and greater value for public money.
Pensioners no longer need to present themselves in front of a bank officer, to provide proof of life.
Today, a pensioner can leverage the Aadhaar biometric platform, to provide this proof with minimal physical effort.
Women form a significant part of the IT workforce.
Digital technology has facilitated several new enterprises led by women.
In this way the IT sector has contributed towards gender empowerment.
Citizens of India are increasingly adopting cashless transactions.
For this, we created the Bharat Interface for Money – or BHIM App.
This App is helping the movement towards a less cash and corruption free society.
When we assumed office in May 2014, many people, particularly youngsters expressed a keen desire to share their ideas and work for the nation.
It is our firm belief that there are millions of Indians, whose transformative ideas can go a long way in taking India to new heights.
Therefore, we launched the citizen engagement portal, MyGov.
This platform enables citizens to share their thoughts and ideas on important issues.
In many key policy areas, we received thousands of valuable suggestions.
Many logo and emblem designs for various Government initiatives today, are the result of crowd-sourcing, and competitions on MyGov.
In fact, even the official app for the Prime Minister’s Office, is the result of a competition floated on MyGov, which received brilliant responses from youngsters.
MyGov is a prime example of how technology strengthens democracy.
Let me turn to another example.
On assuming office, I realized that important government projects and initiatives often suffer on account of unnecessary silos in government functioning, and the lack of focused decision-making.
Therefore, we devised a cyberspace based platform, called PRAGATI or Proactive Governance for Timely Implementation.
PRAGATI, in Hindi, literally means progress.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I meet top Union and State government officials for a PRAGATI Session.
Technology breaks silos.
Sitting in our respective offices, aided by the cyber world, we discuss and resolve important governance issues.
I am happy to share with you that the PRAGATI sessions have resulted in faster decision-making, through consensus, in the larger interest of the nation.
PRAGATI has put back on track infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars which were stuck in red-tape.
I have even tried something of my own, through the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
This App deepens my connect with citizens.
On the other hand, India is keen to find scalable models and innovative solutions in education and health, using digital technology.
We also wish to make cyberspace an enabler for the differently-abled.
Recently, during a thirty six hour Hackathon, college students suggested solutions to chronic problems that were put forward by Ministries.
We look forward to learn from global experiences and best practices.
We believe that growth happens only when we all grow together.
Cyberspace remains a key area for innovation.
Our startups today, are looking to provide solutions to common everyday problems, and improving the lives of people.
I am confident that the global investor community, will recognize the immense potential waiting to be tapped from India’s startup pool.
It offers equity of access, and equality of opportunity.
Today’s discourse is being shaped by Facebookers, Tweeples, and Instagrammers.
Social media platforms are making cyberspace participative for all.
News that experts tell us from studios, is now supplemented by experiences highlighted on social media.
This transition, to a blend of expertise and experience, is the contribution of the cyber world.
The quest for an open and accessible internet often leads to vulnerability.
We need to ensure that vulnerable sections of our society do not fall prey to the evil designs of cyber criminals.
Alertness towards cyber-security concerns, should become a way of life.
One of the major focus areas should be the training of well-equipped and capable professionals to counter cyber threats.
Cyber-warriors who will remain on the alert against cyber-attacks.
The term “hacking” may have acquired an exciting, even if dubious overtone.
We need to ensure that cyber protection becomes an attractive and viable career option for the youth.
On a related note, nations must also take responsibility to ensure that the digital space does not become a playground for the dark forces of terrorism and radicalization.
Information sharing and coordination among security agencies is essential to counter the ever-changing threat landscape.
Surely, we can walk the fine balance between privacy and openness on one hand, and national security on the other.
Together, we can overcome the differences between global and open systems on one hand, and nation-specific legal requirements on the other.
Important questions of transparency, privacy, trust and security may need to be addressed.
Digital technology serves to empower mankind.
We must ensure that it continues to stay that way.
The large multi-stakeholder participation at this event, is proof of the global endorsement that this platform has received.
Nation states, the industry, academia and civil society, all need to work towards a formal collaborative framework.
I am told that all the background and logistics have been handled digitally.
I hope delegates from around the world found it a smooth and seamless experience.
I conclude by wishing you fruitful and productive deliberations and outcomes.
I once again welcome you, and wish the conference all success.

The rate could be a floating or a fixed rate, as decided.
(vi). The bonds will be available both in demat and paper form.
(viii). The price of gold may be taken from the reference rate, as decided, and the Rupee equivalent amount may be converted at the RBI Reference rate on issue and redemption.

Later, delivering the sixth Dr. Ambedkar Memorial Lecture, the Prime Minister categorically asserted that no changes will be made to the Union Government’s reservation policy, so as to deprive the weaker sections of society, of their existing entitlements.
He strongly condemned those who he said were spreading lies and misinformation in this regard.
He recalled that such misinformation had been spread even when Shri Vajpayee was the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister explained that five places were being developed as “Panchteerth” in honour of Dr. Ambedkar.
These included his birthplace in Mhow, the place in London where he stayed while studying in the UK, Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur, Mahaparinirvan Sthal in Delhi, and Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai.
In addition, the Prime Minister also referred to the building for the Dr. Ambedkar Foundation being built at Janpath in New Delhi.
Describing Dr. Ambedkar’s contributions for the nation, he said that while Sardar Patel had united the country politically, Dr. Ambedkar had united it socially through the Constitution.
He recalled how Dr. Ambedkar had advocated equal rights for women, even in an era where this idea faced stiff political opposition.
He said that it is an injustice to Dr. Ambedkar to limit his contributions to just the Dalits, or even just to India.
He said Dr. Ambedkar raised his voice for all those who suffered injustice, and had a global stature, much like Martin Luther King in the US.
Dr. Ambedkar was a Messiah for all labourers – not just Dalit labourers – the Prime Minister said, explaining how he had contributed to limiting working hours to eight.
Talking of recent policy initiatives and legislative measures, the Prime Minister said the vision for developing India’s maritime potential, and indeed for Inland Waterways, was first conceived by Dr. Ambedkar.
Similarly, the vision for providing electricity to all unconnected villages, which the Union Government has promised by 2018, is also a step towards fulfilling Dr. Ambedkar’s vision, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister recalled his recent meetings and interactions with Dalit Entrepreneurs, and the suggestions made by them.
He said all these suggestions had been implemented by the Union Government in the recent Union Budget.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the revised cost estimates to the tune of Rs. 4,799 crore as against the originally approved cost of Rs. 2,500 crore, for setting up of five Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs) at Kolkata, Pune, Mohali, Bhopal and Thiruvananthapuram.
These institutes will integrate Under-graduate education, Post-graduate education and research under the same umbrella.
They will interact with National Laboratories, and other research institutes to develop a synchronous environment for research that would transcend rigid administrative structure and also encourage interdisciplinary research.
Many areas of basic science eventually evolve as applied sciences e.g. lasers, super conductivity, semiconductors, nano-materials etc.
Research in such areas can generate significant intellectual properties which have the potential for generating sizeable revenue.
This proposal of Department of Expenditure was approved by Prime Minister under Rule 12 of (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961 on 02.01.2017.
Settlement of outstanding Cash Credit Limits (CCL) account by availing term loan by the Punjab Government would entail savings in terms of interest payment.
This will create additional resource enabling Punjab Government to undertake capital expenditure.
The terms and conditions of the loan shall be as prescribed by the RBI and the lending banks.
The consortium of banks led by SBI has to finalise the amount in consultation with all stakeholders including Department of Food & Public Distributions, Punjab Government and RBI.
d) After the conversion of legacy accounts in long term loan, the State Govt. of Punjab may issue bonds for the purpose of paying back the long term loan only.
This will be subject to the approval of consortium of Banks and RBI.
The Gol consent will be issued for swapping of loan in the same year of issue of bonds.
Punjab Government shall provide adequate annual budget provision to close CCL gaps on a regular basis to avoid future accumulation of CCL gaps over the years.
It will also make efforts to reduce its subsidy bill to service the repayment of term loan from its own resources.
This Centre will also help NIRD&PR to enhance its status in the region through linkages with other Ministries/Institutes in the CIRDAP Member Countries (CMCs).
The faculty of the NIRD&PR and the Ministry officials would benefit from exchange visits to the best practices in the CMCs.
The scope of work of the Centre is to focus on the implementation of integrated rural development, particularly poverty alleviation programmes within CMC member countries.
India is one of the key founder members of this Organisation.
Its Headquarters is located at Dhaka.
Bangladesh, The objective of CIRDAP is to promote regional cooperation and act as a serving institution for its member countries for promotion of integrated rural development through research action, training, information dissemination etc.
CIRDAP has one sub – regional office in Jakarta, Indonesia.
This sub – regional office of CIRDAP in south-east Asia (SOCSEA) was established in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1997.
The objective was to assist and expand CIRDAP membership and its resources, to conduct training research and pilot projects relevant to South East Asian region.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved abolition of existing “Guidelines for establishing Joint Venture Companies by Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs)”.
This will meet the goal of indigenization / self-reliance in this sector.
The abolition of the existing JV Guidelines will provide a level playing field between DPSUs and the private sector.
The decision comes in the backdrop of the issues which emerged in the operationalisation of JV guidelines of DPSUs.
The Department of Defence Production came to the conclusion that with the increasing participation of the private industry in defence sector and the transformation taking place in the defence acquisition eco system thereon, the requirement of having separate JV guidelines for DPSUs is no longer considered necessary.
In the emerging scenario with primacy being accorded to indigenous manufacturing / Make in India, it is felt that having multiple set of guidelines may lead to ambiguity and incongruity in the environment.
Defence Production Policy promulgated in January 2011 with the objective of achieving substantive self-reliance in defence production including design and development capability had recommended that all viable approaches including JVs to be undertaken to achieve the desired self-reliance in defence production.
Consequent to this, a need was felt to supplement the DPE guidelines with formulation of JV protocols / guidelines tailored for DPSUs which would address the specific requirements of the defence sector and also ensure that the interests of DPSUs were safeguarded.
Accordingly the existing Guidelines for establishing Joint Venture Companies by DPSUs was approved by the Cabinet during the meeting held on 9th February, 2012 and the same was notified on 17th February, 2012.
Now, the requirement for having separate JV Guidelines for DPSUs has been reviewed in the context of the increasing participation of the private industry in defence sector and the transformation taking place in the defence acquisition eco system.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Memorandum of Understanding between India and Japan on Development of Advanced Model Single Window.
The MoU would lead to cooperation between India and Japan on the development of ‘Advanced Model Single Window’ and its operationalization in Central and State Governments in India for taking administrative procedures necessary for business operations, and to develop a structure in which those procedures are completed in an expeditious manner, so as to accelerate India’s effort to promote Ease of Doing Business in India.
The ‘Advanced Model Single Window’ is based on the best practices in and outside India, with measurable parameters and identify possible obstacles for establishment of the Single Window in India.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will visit Mumbai on 11th August, 2018.
After the Convocation, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the new building of the Department of Energy Science & Engineering; and Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering, at IIT Bombay.
Mandatory Accreditation and Regulation of DNA Laboratories
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2018.
• The primary intended purpose for enactment of the “DNA Based Technology (Use and Regulation) Bill 2018” is for expanding the application of DNA-based forensic technologies to support and strengthen the justice delivery system of the country.
• The utility of DNA based technologies for solving crimes, and to identify missing persons, is well recognized across the world.
• By providing for the mandatory accreditation and regulation of DNA laboratories, the Bill seeks to ensure that with the proposed expanded use of this technology in the country, there is also the assurance that the DNA test results are reliable and the data remain protected from misuse or abuse in terms of the privacy rights of our citizens.
• Speedier justice delivery.
• Increased conviction rate.
• Bill’s provisions will enable the cross-matching between persons who have been reported missing on the one hand and unidentified dead bodies found in various parts of the country on the other, and also for establishing the identity of victims in mass disasters.
Forensic DNA profiling is of proven value in solving cases involving offences that are categorized as affecting the human body (such as murder, rape, human trafficking, or grievous hurt), and those against property (including theft, burglary, and dacoity).
The aggregate incidence of such crimes in the country, as per the statistics of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2016, is in excess of 3 lakhs per year.
Of these, only a very small proportion is being subjected to DNA testing at present.
It is expected that the expanded use of this technology in these categories of cases would result not only in speedier justice delivery but also in increased conviction rates, which at present is only around 30% (NCRB Statistics for 2016).
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has congratulated Sh.
B Sai Praneeth for winning the Thailand Open badminton tournament.
India is elated on the accomplishment”, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, addressed the India Today conclave in New Delhi today.
He appreciated the India Today Group for the awareness spread by them about the Swachh Bharat Mission.
Reflecting on his tenure so far, as Prime Minister, he said that his relative lack of experience at the national level turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
Taking the example of apprehensions that were expressed with regard to conduct of foreign policy, he said that the events of the last few days would have set at rest doubts in this regard.
He asserted that today’s India is a New India and a different India.
He said the life of every soldier is precious, and today no one can mess with India.
He said the Government is committed to taking every decision in national interest.
He said certain elements both inside and outside the country, who are against the country, are fearful of this unity seen in India.
He added that this fear, is actually good.
He said enemies are fearful of India’s valour, and the corrupt are fearful of the law, and this fear is good.
He said New India is marching ahead, confident of its abilities and resources.
He questioned the stance of those, who doubt the intentions of the Government and the Armed Forces.
He said that in opposing Narendra Modi, these people have started opposing India as well, and are harming the country.
He said such people doubt the Indian Armed Forces, but trust those who foment terrorism in India.
Specifically, he said that India felt the absence of the Rafale fighter jet recently, over which a lot of politics has been played.
He strongly criticized those whose actions adversely affect national security.
He said that those who ruled the nation for many years had interests in two things – doles and deals.
He said that the biggest sufferers of this approach were our Jawans and Kisans.
He said that the defence sector suffered because of the deals made by some, while agriculture suffered because there was no concrete policy beyond doles.
These doles were given so that the poor remain poor and remain at the mercy of the political class, he added.
The best example of this is the farm loan waivers, he said.
He explained that the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, a comprehensive scheme for farmer welfare, is part of the Government’s different approach to empower farmers.
It was launched within 24 days of announcement, he added.
He explained that fifty five months of his Government, and the fifty five years of the others have given two contrasting approaches to governance.
They had a ‘token approach’, we have a ‘total approach,’ he said.
In this context, he mentioned initiatives taken in the areas of One Rank One Pension for the Armed Forces; financial inclusion for the poor; clean cooking fuel (Ujjwala Yojana); Power for all; and Housing for all.
He said India is today removing poverty at a rapid rate, and is the fastest growing large economy.
Thirty nine Officer Trainees of Indian Foreign Service, currently undergoing training in the Foreign Service Institute, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today.
The Prime Minister said that IFS Officers should remain alive not only to the current national priorities, but also future requirements for national development.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today gave its approval for enhancement of.
The approval will enlarge the quantum of funds available for economic activities, better coverage and enhanced outreach to double the Below Poverty Line (DPL) Scheduled Caste beneficiaries.
Background:-
Your Excellency Dr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
Your Excellency Dr. Ashraf Ghani, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
Honourable Ministers
Ladies and Gentlemen
A famous poet of Persia, Hafez once said:
Today, we are all witnessing creation of history.
Not just for the people of our three countries, but for the entire region.
To build bonds of connectivity is the most basic of human urges.
Today, we seek to fulfil it.
We are grateful to Excellency Rouhani for hosting this unique event.
Thank you President Ashraf Ghani, for your presence.
It truly holds a special significance.
It is a privilege to be here.
Excellency Rouhani, President Ghani and I have just held detailed discussions on a range of issues.
The agenda for economic engagement is a clear priority for us.
We stand together in unity of our purpose.
To carve out new routes of peace, and prosperity is our common goal.
We want to link with the world.
But, better connectivity among ourselves is also our priority.
It is indeed a new dawn for the region.
Iran, Afghanistan and India are deeply aware of the richness and reality of our ancient links.
Through centuries, art and culture, ideas and knowledge, language and traditions have formed a common bond between us.
Even through turmoil of history, our societies never lost touch with each other.
Today, we meet to write new chapters in our engagement.
Inflow of capital and technology could lead to new industrial infrastructure in Chahbahar.
This would include gas based fertilizer plants, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and IT.
The key arteries of the corridor would pass through the Chahbahar port of Iran.
It’s very location, on the mouth of Gulf of Oman, is of great strategic significance.
Afghanistan will get an assured, effective, and a more friendly route to trade with the rest of the world.
The arc of economic benefit from this agreement would extend beyond our three nations.
Its reach could extend to the depths of the Central Asian countries.
When linked with the International North South Transport Corridor, it would touch South Asia at one end and Europe at another.
And, studies show that as compared to the traditional sea routes, it could bring down the cost and time of the cargo trade to Europe by about 50%.
Over time, we could even look to connect it with the strong sea and land based routes that India has developed with the Indian Ocean Region and South East Asia.
Today, the watch-words of international tiesare trust not suspicion; cooperation not dominance; inclusivity not exclusion.
This is also the guiding philosophy and driving spirit of the Chahbahar Agreement.
This will be a corridor of peace and prosperity for our peoples.
Motives of economic growth, and empowerment would drive it.
It will build our security without making others vulnerable.
It would break barriers among our nations and encourage new benchmarks of people-to-people contacts.
And, help us to eventually build what we all desire and deserve – a friendly and healthy neighbourhood.
The world around us is changing in fundamental ways.
And, the lack of comprehensive connectivity is not the only challenge that limits our national growth.
Political turmoil and undercurrents of economic stress continue to spread in West Asia.
In the Indo-Pacific,rise a mix of political competition and economic opportunities is putting pressure on the existing Asian order.
Global economy is yet to fully come out of uncertainty and weakness.
Our present growth and future prosperity is under threat from the spread of radical ideas and physical terror.
Amidst this landscape, our three countries are blessed with the most potent resource—our youth.
Our three nations are estimated to have more than 60 percent of their population under 30 years of age.
They are an asset in our national and regional development.
We want them to walk the road to knowledge and skills; industry and enterprise.
And, not fall victim to the path of guns and violence.
I am confident that economic fruits of the Chahbahar Agreement will expand trade, attract investment, build infrastructure, develop industry and create jobs for our youth.
The Agreement will strengthen our ability to stand in mutual support against those whose only motto is to maim and kill the innocents.
Its success will be a positive vote for peace and stability in the region.
It is my strong belief that trade and transit routes should only be a starting point of our journey to greater connectivity.
In my vision, the full spectrum of connectivity agenda between Iran, Afghanistan and India should span:
• from culture to commerce;
• from traditions to technology;
• from Investments to IT;
• from services to strategy; and
• Establish peace and create stability;
• Build economic prosperity and engineer new trade ties;
• Curb radicalism and remove shadows of terror; and
History will look back at this effort with nothing but approval and admiration.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has expressed grief at the loss of lives due to unseasonal rains and storms in MP, Rajasthan, Manipur & various parts of the country.
“The government is doing its best to provide all possible assistance to those affected.
The situation is being monitored closely”, the PM said.
The Prime Minister has approved an ex- gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund for the next of kin of those who have lost their lives due to unseasonal rain and storms in MP, Rajasthan, Manipur & various parts of the country.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the Border Security Force (BSF) personnel and their families on BSF Raising Day.
“Greetings to @BSF_India personnel and their families on BSF Raising Day.
They protect us from adversity, be it on the borders as well as in times of natural disasters and accidents.
We are proud of BSF.”, the Prime Minister said.
The Summit, will be co-hosted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, WHO South East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) and Stop TB Partnership.
The Prime Minister will launch Tuberculosis Free India Campaign on this occasion.
TB free India Campaign will take the activities of National Strategic Plan for TB elimination forward in Mission mode.
The National Strategic Plan for TB elimination is backed by funding of over 12,000 crore rupees over the next three years to ensure every TB patient has access to quality diagnosis, treatment, and support.
The new NSP adopts a multi-pronged approach which aims to ‘Detect’ all TB patients with an emphasis on reaching TB patients seeking care from private providers and undiagnosed TB in high-risk populations,
The Central University would be mentored by an existing Central University till its governing structure is in place.
– Mr. Prime Minister, many thanks to you for giving us a chance to meet you prior to your visit to Russia.
What are your feelings right now?
What do you expect from this trip?
Russian citizens too maintained unwavering relations with India.
And politically apart, the Russian citizens have shown considerable interest in the Indian traditions and India’s culture.
And it makes our relationship stronger.
In a way, mine and President Putin’s political journey has moved identically.
And in 2001, I visited as member of the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s delegation, in capacity of a chief minister.
So that was my first meeting.
When I go to Russia, there is a thought in my mind that I have delayed the visit a bit.
Secondly, I am hesitating a bit.
But I am filled with enthusiasm that I’m going to a friend’s house.
And visit a friend, the feeling of oneness, the emotions, I am feeling it.
The relations between India and Russia are linked together through the water, land and sky.
Our defense source, defense power, in all these Russia is associated with us for all those years.
Similarly, in the global environment, in times of crisis, where you need a friend, Russia has always stood with us.
We never had to wait to know what Russia will do with us in this regard.
We remain confident that we are doing this, Russia will do it with us.
So this in itself, an atmosphere of trust continues between the two countries.
And in this sense, our relationship, in one way is a new level of strategic partnership, which is taking us in that direction.
– Mr. Prime Minister, you told us in great detail how close the relationship between our two countries is.
We have historic ties continuing over the years.
What do you think of the dynamics of this relationship today?
You have met President Putin several times.
It is true that I have made a good introduction with President Putin.
The world knows him as a strong leader.
He is a decisive person.
And the best thing is that he knows how to maintain relations.
He has a special strength to sacrifice for the relations.
It is rarely found.
And therefore, for him to sacrifice, to maintain relations are his special strength.
Between me and President Putin, trust is a very big strength, confidence is a very big strength.
Secondly it is openness.
There are those who think something, but say something else.
This I have not experienced with President Putin.
Whenever there is a crisis in the world, Russia comes up with its own ideas with its strength.
All this is because of the leadership of President Putin.
India always remembers Russia as a friend.
– The Russian-Indian ties have a long and rich history.
Relations between our countries have never been overshadowed by wars or conflicts.
How do you see the dynamics of relations between our countries?
– Indeed, ours is a relationship with strong and deep roots in history.
Indians will never forget the Russian support that we got when we needed it the most.
The world has gone through enormous political and economic, technological transformation since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union.
However, through these turbulent times, our relationship has remained on a steady course of progress.
A lot of credit goes to President Putin and Indian leaders over the past two decades.
I am pleased to see where our relationship is today.
Russia was the first country with which we concluded a formal agreement on strategic partnership, which has since been elevated to the level of ‘special and privileged’ strategic partnership in recognition of our multifaceted bilateral engagement.
I see positive signs of further growth owing to complementarities of both the countries.
The strengths of Russia in science and technology, military technology and nuclear energy to name a few, complement the large market of India, expanding economy and demand of its young population.
This provides us with the confidence that we can take forward our existing dynamic partnership.
– The dynamic development of the entire range of bilateral relations has lent them a trait of comprehensive strategic partnership.
Russia and India have made tangible progress in advancing cooperation in a wide variety of spheres.
– Our relations with Russia have been unique, covering almost every field of human endeavour.
We have excellent understanding at the political level.
We have robust partnership in the field of defenыe, nuclear energy, science and technology and other areas.
Energy is a sector where we can do a lot more.
We have had significant investments in this sector.
Nuclear energy is an important component of our energy security strategy.
Russia is currently our leading international partner.
Our cooperation with Russia in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is a cornerstone of our strategic partnership.
I am glad that the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project has become operational, and is set to expand.
I believe our cooperation in the area of nuclear energy will continue to grow.
After Kudankulam, we are finalizing a second site for Russian-designed reactors in India.
We have outlined an ambitious vision for nuclear energy and construction of at least 12 reactors, which will have the highest safety standards in the world.
As two countries possessing advanced nuclear technology, we are interested in taking forward this cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Cooperation in pharmaceuticals has seen mutually beneficial investments and reliable supply of medicines at international quality while at affordable prices.
There is potential to further strengthen our relations in the field of trade and investments.
Our bilateral trade, though growing, has not achieved its full potential.
We have committed to increase this to $30 billion by 2025.
Similarly we are committed to increase our investments to $15 billion each by 2025.
In addition to bringing our businesses and CEOs together, we are also in the process of launching negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement with Eurasian Economic Union.
We are establishing a more direct trade route through the International North South Transit Corridor that will drastically reduce cost and time for transporting goods between India and Russia.
And, we have recently notified a Diamond Trading Centre in India that will enable Russia uncut diamonds to be directly routed to India for processing rather than through third countries.
– Military-technical cooperation between Russia and India has been underway for more than half a century now and its scale is traditionally wide.
What is your vision of the results of cooperation in that sphere and its outlook?
We value Russian support during the era when not many doors were open to us.
Even in the current environment, and despite India’s improved access to the world market, Russia remains our principal partner.
The aircraft carrier ‘INS Vikramaditya’, Sukhoi fighter jets and Brahmos cruise missiles are great symbol of our defence cooperation.
They are the result of unwavering mutual trust and confidence and reflect the strength of our strategic partnership.
What are the main goals?
What else do you want to do?
– I am the first Prime Minister who for 14 years had the opportunity to work as a Chief Minister.
And due to this I understand well the utility of States in India, their importance, the strength of federal structure in letter and spirit.
And so my first idea in governance is that this country can not stand on one pillar.
And therefore I have put stress on the “Team India” concept.
We have put great emphasis on Cooperative Federalism, Cooperative competitive Federalism which shall show good results in near future.
Secondly, every country has this goal, happiness of countrymen, satisfaction of countrymen.
How will the life of our countrymen change?
How to bring improvement in quality of life?
If they are imparted education then everyone should get it.
Education of high standard must be imparted.
Qualitative changes must come in progressive education.
Then the citizen starts moving on his own.
So our focus must be to provide the opportunities.
Skill development and human resource development is my main goal.
“Make in India” – creation of a manufacturing hub is my effort.
And so from my past one and a half year’s experience, I can say that India has well achieved it.
These days you must have observed that India is being seen in global ranking as an economic power.
The development is very fast in India.
It is regarded by the entire world.
If the 21st century is the century of Asia, India’s obligation increases.
As a democratic country, India has more responsibility.
And we are fully aware.
How can we play our role in the world by adding the two, the development in the form of a democratic country and human values?
Many countries are fighting against it.
India has also lost its citizens in terror attacks and has its own experience in combatting terrorism.
How the world must fight against it, in your opinion?
What counter-terrorism efforts Russia and India should take together?
We have seen the fiercest of fierce forms of terrorism.
And it remains a danger for the innocent civilians.
Today it is slowly spreading throughout the world.
But unfortunately the world was not ready to accept our point.
It was not willing to understand.
They thought that it is India’s problem.
But we are sad about it that what we said has come true today.
We are sad about it.
Terrorism is the enemy of humanity.
Those who believe in humanity, all those powers must unite against terrorism.
Humanity is not restricted within political boundaries.
Political philosophy can not weigh humanity.
Humanity must be weighed with the scale of humanity only.
And all who believe in humanity, irrespective of any political consideration, must come together and only then they can fight it.
The United Nations was born after the two world wars.
There were no wars, but fierce terrorism was killing the innocents.
Wars were fought at the borders between the soldiers.
In terrorism, armed people hunt for innocent citizens.
It is ghastlier than the world wars.
But it is very unfortunate that we all together could not explain terrorism in the United Nations.
We could not define terrorism.
Who will be considered aiding terrorism?
What will be done with such countries?
The United Nations is not able to show the courage even to consider it for discussion.
Because some countries somewhere in the world are involved and are putting obstacles in it.
The world will have to understand it.
As far as Syria is concerned, and West Asia as a whole, West Asia was moving towards prosperity.
But we are seeing that prosperity does not provide contentment and happiness.
That only wealth, money, property and strong power, provide peace and happiness – no that is not true.
West Asia is seeing this.
The other thing which we are seeing today is that everybody says that terrorism must end.
But everybody’s priority is different, everyone is inclined differently.
This situation gives strength to the terrorists.
Secondly, none of the terrorist groups have their own factories for manufacturing weapons.
It means that there are some countries which have weapons and provide them.
Which is that route?
Why is it not being blocked?
The terrorists do not run any money printing machine.
Where from the money flows the world over?
Where from the strength comes for such big battles?
In the new year, let us make a resolution to work for a terror-free world, we should safeguard the natural resources, and to save them, we must try our best to fulfill our obligations as human beings.
Recalling that the close and friendly India-Nepal relations are built on the strong foundation of shared historical and cultural links and close people to people contacts, the two Prime Ministers underscored the importance of regular high-level political exchanges in cementing bilateral ties.
Prime Minister Modi stated that Government of India’s vision of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ is a guiding framework for India’s engagement with its neighbours for a shared vision of inclusive development and prosperity.
Prime Minister Oli stated that after the landmark political transformation, his Government has given priority to economic transformation with the motto ‘Samriddha Nepal Sukhi Nepali’.
Prime Minister Modi congratulated the people and the Government of Nepal for successful conduct of local level, federal parliament and first-ever provincial elections in Nepal and appreciated their vision for stability, and development.
The two Prime Ministers inaugurated the Integrated Check Post at Birgunj in Nepal.
They hoped that its early operationalization will enhance cross-border trade and transit of goods and movement of people bringing greater opportunities for shared growth and development.
· India-Nepal: New Partnership in Agriculture
· Expanding Rail Linkages: Connecting Raxaul in India to Kathmandu in Nepal
· New Connectivity between India and Nepal through Inland Waterways
The two Prime Ministers agreed that the visit has imparted new dynamism to the multifaceted partnership between the two countries.
First published in 1863, Kulliyat-e-Farsi-e-Ghalib is a collection of over 11,000 verses by Ghalib.
Governor of Manipur, Dr. Najma Heptullah,
They all made out-standing contributions to Indian science and education.
He was a friend of India and had visited our country twice.
The common man knows Hawking’s name, not because of his work on black holes, but because of his unusually high commitment and spirit against all odds.
He will be remembered as one of the world’s greatest motivators of all time.
I am also pleased to see Manipur University hosting this important event.
The University is emerging as an important center of higher education in the North-East.
I am told, that this is just the second time in over a century that the Indian Science Congress is being held in the North-East.
This is a testimony to the resurgent spirit of the North East.
Science is after all, but a means to a far greater end – of making a difference in the lives of others, of furthering human progress and welfare.
The time is also ripe, to commit ourselves to facilitate ‘Ease of Living’ for 125 crore Indians, through the power as well as potential of science and technology.
When you leave Manipur, I am sure you will also carry the same spirit of dedication to do something ever-lasting for our nation.
I am also sure you will continue to work closely with the scientists you have met here.
After all, effective solutions to big problems of science and technology, also require close cooperation and coordination among scientists across diverse streams.
The Union Government has initiated several new programs for the North-Eastern States, in the area of science.
Agro-Meteorological Services are being provided under the ग्रामीणकृषिमौसमसेवा.This is benefiting over five lakh farmers.
We are now working to expand this network to all districts of the North-East.
Several new centers are bringing relevant science and technology to the North-East.
An “Ethno Medicinal Research Centre“ has been set up in Manipur.
They will undertake risk analysis, and raise public awareness about climate change.
We have freed “bamboo” from being treated as a ‘Tree’ species, and classified it as a “Grass,” which it scientifically is.
For this, we changed a decades old law.
This amendment will allow for the free movement of bamboo.
It will ensure that the production and consumption centers are seamlessly integrated.
It will make farmers realize the true potential from the entire value chain in the bamboo ecosystem.
Government is also revamping the National Bamboo Mission with an outlay of Rs. 1200 crore.
States like Manipur will benefit from this decision.
The Indian Science Congress has a rich legacy.
It has been led by some of India’s tallest scientists, such as Acharya J.C. Bose, C.V. Raman, Meghnad Saha and S.N. Bose.
New India, should seek inspiration from the high standards of excellence, set by these great scientists.
During our interactions on various occasions, I have exhorted our scientists to seek solutions to our socio economic problems.
I have urged them to take up new challenges to benefit the poor and deprived sections of society.
In this context, the theme chosen for the Indian Science Congress this year, is quite appropriate: “Reaching the Unreached through Science and Technology”.
The theme is very close to my heart.
Take the case of RajagopalanVasudevan recognized with a Padma Shri in 2018.He is a professor from Madurai who developed and patented an innovative method to reuse plastic waste in the construction of roads.
The roads made using this method are more durable, water resistant and load bearing.
At the same time he has found a constructive use for the ballooning problem of plastic waste.
Professor Vasudevan has given this technology to the Government for free.
This technology has already been used to lay over 5,000 kilometers of roads across 11 states.
Chintakindi Mallesham was given a Padma Shri in 2017, for inventing the Laxmi ASU Machine which significantly reduced the time and labour required to weave Sarees.
I therefore urge you to direct your research and innovation towards solving the problems of our times and meeting the aspirations of our people.
Scientific Social Responsibility is the need of the hour.
The Session’s theme also raises some questions.
Have we done enough to ensure that children in India are sufficiently exposed to science?
Are we giving them a conducive environment to develop their inherent talent?
Our scientific achievements need to be actively communicated to the society.
This will help inculcate scientific temper among the youth.
It will also excite and attract our young minds to careers in science.
We have to throw open our national institutions and laboratories to our children.
I call upon scientists to develop an appropriate mechanism for interaction with school-going children.
I also urge them, to spend 100 hours every year, with 100 students of Classes 10, 11 and 12 discussing various aspects of science and technology.
100 hours and 100 students, imagine how many scientists we can nurture this way!
We are committed to increasing the share of non-fossil fuel based capacity in the electricity mix above 40 per cent by 2030.
India is a leader in the multi-country International Solar Alliance and in Mission Innovation.
These groupings are providing a thrust to R&D for clean energy.
The Department of Atomic Energy is setting up ten new domestic Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors of 700 Mega Watt capacity each.
This is a major boost to the domestic nuclear industry.
It strengthens India’s credentials as a major nuclear manufacturing nation.
In recent times, CSIR has developed a hand-held milk tester, which helps every family to test quality of milk within seconds.
We are making concerted efforts to achieve complete elimination of TB from India.
A few days ago, at the ‘End TB Summit’ in New Delhi, we demonstrated our commitment to eliminate TB from India by 2025, five years ahead of the WHO target of 2030.
Our space research program has the capacity to successfully place over one hundred satellites in space in one go.
This has been made possible through the hard work and dedication of Indian Scientists.
After the success of Chandrayan-1 we plan to launch Chandrayan-2 in the coming months.
This fully indigenous effort will include landing and travel on the surface of the moon by a rover.
The greatest scientist of the last century, Albert Einstein had given the theory about “gravitational waves”.
It will expand our knowledge in basic Sciences in the areas of lasers, light waves, and computing.
I am told that our scientists are tirelessly working towards making this a reality.
I have talked about developing Clusters of Excellence in Science in Cities, around important Scientific Institutions.
The objective is to create city-based R&D Clusters, which will bring together all Science and Technology partners, from Academia to Institutes, to Industries to Startups.
This will help promote new discoveries, and create globally competitive vibrant research hubs.
We have recently approved a new “Prime Minister’s Research Fellows” scheme.
Under this Scheme, bright minds from the best Institutions in the country, namely, IISc, IIT, NIT, IISER and IIIT will be offered direct admission in Ph.D. Programme in IIT and IISc.
This scheme will help address the brain-drain from our country.
It will go a long way in promoting indigenous research in cutting-edge Science and Technology domains.
We need science and technology to help us make India clean, green and prosperous.
Let me re-iterate some of my expectations from scientists.
A large section of our tribal population is affected by सिकलसेलअनीमिया.
Can our Scientists come up with a simple, cost-effective solution to this problem in the near future?
A large proportion of our children are affected by malnutrition.
To address this problem, the Government of India has launched the National Nutrition Mission.
Your suggestions and solutions can help us meet the objectives of the Mission.
India requires crores of new houses.
Can our scientists adopt 3D printing technology to help us meet this demand?
Our rivers are polluted.
It requires your innovative ideas and new technologies to clean them.
We need a multi-pronged approach including efficient solar and wind power, energy storage and electric mobility solutions, clean cooking, conversion of coal to clean fuels like methanol, cleaner power from coal, smart grids, micro-grids and bio-fuels.
We have set a target of having 100 Giga Watts of installed solar power by 2022.
Imagine the resources we will be saving on this account.
ISRO uses one of the best battery systems to run satellites in space.
Other institutions can partner with ISRO to develop cost effective and efficient battery systems for mobile phones and electric cars.
We need to develop new procedures, medicines, and vaccines to get rid of silent killers like Malaria and Japanese Encephalitis.
Research should also be conducted in Yoga, sports, and traditional knowledge disciplines.
Small and medium scale industry units have been the main-stay for employment generation.
With global competition, they are facing increasing challenges.
Can our scientific and technological institutions take up the cause of the MSME sector and assist these units in improving processes and products?
We have to be future ready in implementing technologies vital for the growth and prosperity of the nation.
Technology will allow far greater penetration of services such as education, healthcare, and banking to our citizens.
India should become a major player in developing technologies, devices, standards and manufacturing for 5-G broadband tele-communication networks by 2020.
Four years from now, we will be celebrating the 75th year of our Independence.
This goal requires whole-hearted contribution from each one of you.
The Indian economy is on a high growth trajectory.
But we rank low in Human Development Indicators.
One of the important reasons for this in-consistency is major inter-state and intra-state disparity.
To address this, we have launched a concerted effort to improve the performance of over 100 Aspirational Districts.
We shall focus on important sectors such as Health and Nutrition; Education; Agriculture and Water Resources; Financial Inclusion; Skill Development; and Basic Infrastructure.
The “one size fits all” approach cannot work in this case.
Can our Scientific Institutions serve these Aspirational Districts?
Can they catalyze creation and diffusion of appropriate technologies that generate skills and entrepreneur-ship?
This would be a great service to Mother India.
India has a rich tradition and a long history of both discovery and use science and technology.
It is time to reclaim our rightful place among the front-line nations in this field.
I call upon the scientific community to extend its research from the labs, to the land.
I am confident that through the dedicated efforts of our scientists, we are embarking on the road to a better future.
The future we wish for ourselves, and for our children.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for introduction of Dam Safety Bill, 2018 in the Parliament.
This shall also help in safeguarding human life, livestock and property.
The draft Bill has been finalised after wide consultation with leading Indian experts and international experts.
The Bill provides for proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of all specified dams in the country to ensure their safe functioning.
The Bill provides for constitution of a State Committee on Dam Safety by State Government.
National Dam Safety Authority
State Committee on Dam Safety
Plus there are thousands of medium and small dams.
Due to lack of legal and institutional architecture for dam safety in India, dam safety is an issue of concern.
The Dam Safety Bill, 2018 address all issues concerning dam safety including regular inspection of dams, Emergency Action Plan, comprehensive dam safety review, adequate repair and maintenance funds for dam safety, Instrumentation and Safety Manuals.
India is a founder member of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which came into existence in 1919.
At present, the ILO has 187 members.
The principal means of action in the ILO is the setting up of International standards in the form of Conventions, Recommendations and Protocol.
Out of these 4 are Fundamental or Core Conventions.
Government has taken up a multipronged strategy including both stringent legislative and Project based approach to address the concerns related to child labour.
However, there is a need to further accentuate its initiatives to ensure a safe and fulfilled future for the children of our country by ensuring proper implementation of the provisions of the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 which now completely prohibits employment or work of children below 14 years in any occupation or process.
The momentum of the recent initiatives taken to eradicate child labour has to be maintained as elimination of child labour is also crucial for the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
The ratification of the Convention No 138 and 182 would move a step ahead in the direction of achieving the goal of eradication of child labour from the country as it would be legally binding to comply with the provisions of the Conventions.
Presently, Convention 138 has been ratified by 169 countries and Convention 182 has been ratified by 180 countries.
What I mean to say is, given this rising popular interest in Football and the opportunity of hosting FIFA Under-17 World Cup, shall we just play the role of a host and fulfil our responsibility?
Or will we use the opportunity to our advantage to promote sports?
We can see all this happening in relation to cricket; we should now try to bring these elements in relation to other sports disciplines as well.
Can you send me your suggestions on how best to use that opportunity?
I consider this to be an opportunity to let the world know of India’s youth power – not in the sense of winning or losing a match.
In the run-up to and preparation for the 2017 FIFA event, we can harness and display our many strengths; while doing so, we can do image-branding for India as well.
We get to experience something fresh with each new place we visit – we learn about people, their languages, foods and lifestyles.
Someone has rightly said that “A traveller without observation is a bird without wings”.
“If you have a desire to truly view, you should also develop an insight.”
This time a lot of suggestions have come for Mann Ki Baat on www.mygov.in: –
Why don’t you have a look at this gift for you and give it a try to see if something in it is of use to you?
Can we not remove the blockage and clean the inlets so that more water gets collected?
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, a few days ago the Government of India had organised a very big Kisan Mela, ‘Farmers’ Fair’.
There is not a trace of sweat; there is just no walking around.
Even if we play games, we play them online; very little happens offline.
Paradoxically, when TB was linked to death we used to be duly afraid of it; but now that it is curable, we have become almost careless about it.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Bolivia on Cooperation in the field of Geology and Mineral Resources.
Prime Minister said that he looked forward to launch the International Solar Alliance along with the French President and other leaders during the COP 21 Summit.
As part of the event, the Prime Minister will unveil a statue of Dr. Kalam.
He will open and witness a photo exhibition titled “A Celebration of Dr. Kalam’s Life.”
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval to create one post of Deputy Comptroller & Auditor General (Coordination, Communication and Information System) in Pay Level-17 (by abolishing one STS level post) in the Office of the Comptroller & Auditor General of India.
The Deputy Comptroller & Auditor General shall oversee the coordination among State Audits, audit of telecommunication and to coordinate the various Information Systems (IS) initiatives within the Indian Audit & Accounts Department (IA&AD).
Expenditure on account of creation of this post will be Rs.21 Lakh (approx.).
The interview with ANI follows:
It is for the people of this country to grade and evaluate us.
How can I take away their right?
I have presented my report card to the country.
Recently, media has published the findings of some surveys.
You would already have seen them.
I can only say that we have laid a solid foundation on which the people can rate us.
2. You came in with the promise of “Acche Din.”
Have you been able to meet the goals that you set for yourself in the first year of the government?
I am fully satisfied with the work that we have done.
The most satisfying part of this year is that we have lived up to the promise that our intentions will be pure and our actions will be driven by long-term national interest.
Recall the situation one year ago.
Massive corruption at various levels of Government gave rise to scams on a regular basis.
Corruption was seen as the biggest problem.
(Bad days are over).
Is this not Acche Din for the country?
3. What has been the single big success in the past year?
The achievements and successes of my Government are numerous.
However, I know that the success of a Government’s journey lies in reaching the last man.
Therefore, our efforts were directed towards the poor and marginalized.
We have also paid special attention to remote corners of the country.
Our objective is to transform quality of life, infrastructure and services.
We have worked simultaneously on all fronts which bring a smile on the face of the common man.
I can give you some examples.
From controlling food prices to enhancing farm productivity; improving Railways to strengthening Roads; generating electricity to its 24×7 availability; building school toilets to setting up IITs, IIMs and AIIMS; building houses for the homeless to upgrading our heritage cities; cleaning surroundings to bridging the digital divide; making world class products to skilling and employment generation; strengthening the banking system to funding the unfunded; ensuring labour welfare to providing social security to common man; rejuvenating rivers to irrigating fields; from enhancing co-operation with States to deepening foreign relations; we have worked at an energetic pace and with innovative spirit.
How committed is your government in bringing back black money to India?
My Government is fully committed on the issue of Black Money.
We want to crack down severely on tax evasion and black money.
I had taken up this issue with world leaders during the G-20 summit.
In our very first cabinet meeting, we formed an SIT.
We want to make it more difficult to evade taxes and siphon money abroad.
We are also aggressively pursuing cases against those who have stashed funds illegally in foreign banks.
Recently the names of some such persons have been revealed.
We are also trying to move towards cashless transactions.
We want to make maximum use of ICT in our tax administration.
At the same time, we want to remove the discretion which causes corruption and generation of Black Money.
Hence, we promulgated ordinances in sectors like coal and mines.
It has proved to be a good step.
We have generated Rs. 3.30 lakh crore for the country so far through transparent auction of some coal mines.
Similar is the case with auction of spectrum.
I can say that if your intentions are noble, you are sure to get success and required support.
5. Key bills like the Land Acquisition Bill has got stiff opposition from the opposition.
They have been able to create doubts about the government’s intention.
What do you have to say?
Opposition to our Land Bill is totally unjustified and unfortunate.
We have not made any changes for private industry.
Moreover, if you have money, you don’t need a Land Acquisition Act to accumulate land.
Some individuals have done so in Rajasthan, Haryana, Shimla, Delhi etc.
Land acquisition becomes necessary for government-driven strategic and development activities, especially in undeveloped areas.
We have made changes only in response to demands of the States.
The benefits of these changes will also accrue to the rural poor in terms of irrigation, housing, electrification, as well as better physical and social infrastructure.
In this country, the Land Acquisition Act was almost 120 years old.
The Congress-led Governments used the same Act after independence.
Now, they are not even ready to sit and discuss.
We believe in dialogue with all political parties.
I have personally appealed in Parliament that we are ready to open a dialogue with political parties and consider their suggestions.
I hope that the parties will cooperate on issues of larger national importance without getting into political calculations.
6. How are you going to convince the farmers of this country that you mean well?
The proposed Land Acquisition Bill focuses on benefitting the farmer and balancing the long-term interests of the nation.
The world is changing fast.
Even farmers need canals to irrigate, roads to transfer products from farms to markets.
They need hospitals, schools and houses.
Farmers want modern amenities in their vicinity and jobs in formal sectors for their sons and daughters.
I have always believed that if we want inclusive development, we need amenities.
We need to match the development of such amenities with agricultural growth.
This is what the Bill strives to do while safeguarding the interests of farmers.
Our amendments only aim to do away with the bureaucratic bottlenecks in the 2013 Act.
7. Agriculture is in distress in the country.
The root causes of the problem find mention in your question itself.
We have responded to the recent agrarian crisis with alacrity.
We have undertaken several reforms.
The Union Government has enhanced the relief norms for compensation against crop loss by 50%.
The limit of minimum crop damage, for grant of compensation, has been reduced from 50% to 33%.
Norms have been relaxed to allow procurement of damaged food grains at MSP rates.
The target of agricultural credit has been enhanced in our two consecutive budgets.
But as you said, the problem in agriculture is endemic.
Nothing much was done for six long decades.
But we have started long-term steps for the farm sector.
To address the issue of access to irrigation for every farm, and efficient utilization of water, the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) has been started.
Blue Revolution which aims to improve production and productivity in the fisheries sector is also an action point.
We have launched the soil health card scheme.
The price stabilization fund with a corpus of Rs. 500 crores has also been set up for perishable commodities.
Rashtriya Gokul Mission has been commenced with the objective of conserving and developing indigenous cattle breeds.
We have made honest and sincere efforts for rural development.
I have recently launched the Kisan Channel for giving timely information to farmers on inputs and markets.
In the coming days, I would like to see more focused action on increasing Farm Productivity; Rural Industrialization; Skill Development in rural areas and rural trades, and faster Investments in Rural Infrastructure including cold chain.
8. The opposition has termed your government as suit boot ki sarkar.
What is your take on this allegation?
Suit-boot is definitely more acceptable than suitcase.
After ruling for sixty years, the Congress has suddenly remembered the poor.
People of this country have suffered and remained poor due to shortsighted policies of the Congress.
Many countries of the world have surpassed us on all accounts including poverty removal.
Congress did incremental work so as to keep the issue relevant for next election.
Did the coal and spectrum scandals or the CWG fiasco benefit the poor?
Everyone knows who were their beneficiaries – some chosen industrialists and contractors.
The result of Congress’s politics and governance of sixty years is that poverty is still our biggest challenge.
One-fourth of the families are without shelter.
Health, education, water, electricity and roads are even bigger unrealised dreams for a large number of citizens of this country.
You should ask them- If you were pro-poor, why does poverty still exist in India?”
9. Opposition says that your government is pro-industrialists.
Those who gave away precious natural resources like coal and spectrum to their favourite industrialists have no right to say this.
We are working for the common man of the country.
In the very initial months of our Government, we took up the task of providing toilets in all schools.
Don’t children of the poor study in these public schools?
We implemented the Jan Dhan scheme and opened more than 14 crore bank accounts for financial inclusion.
What did they do all these years?
We have planned to see that by 2022, no family remains without a roof over its head;
The Soil Health Card scheme has been launched to enhance farm productivity and reduce expenses, thereby enhancing the farmer’s income;
We have come out with a comprehensive social security scheme for the poor and marginalised, old and those with low income levels;
Swachh Bharat Mission has been started to see that health and hygiene issues of the poor do not affect the working capacity and output of the poor and labourers;
The Indian Railways, on which the common man travels, is being changed for the better
In the past, the country had been led into an economy of jobless growth.
We provided for reservation of women in the police forces of Union Territories.
This was done even when there were no elections around the corner.
Through the regime of coal auction that we have put in place, more than Rs. three lakh crore have already been generated for the less-developed states of India.
This money will be used for the poor of those states.
Why were these things not done in the past sixty years.
Who prevented them?
Their worry is not that we are not pro-poor.
Their worry is that they are being exposed as not being pro-poor.
People are asking them: “If Modi Government can think and do this in six to nine months, why could you not think and do it in sixty years.”
But you seem to enjoy running the country’s foreign policy.
Any comments?
Foreign engagements are international obligations on the part of the Prime Minister.
All Prime Ministers have to do this.
Moreover, this is an integrated world.
We have endeavoured to nurture new economic partnerships and tap reserves of energy, minerals, technology and finance from major economies.
11. In real terms, do you see that the Chinese will actually deliver on the financial pledge they have done, that the US will open up its markets for India, that Pakistan will give up its anti-India agenda?
That our smaller neighbours will stop seeing us as a bully?
Yes, I am sure that the commitments and agreements will be implemented.
We have received a commitment from the Government of Japan for facilitating public and private funding of 3.5 trillion Yen – or approximately 35 billion U.S. dollars – over the next five years; there are agreements with China on two industrial parks and intended investments of 20 billion U.S. dollars; there are investment plans of about 42 billion U.S. dollars from U.S. companies over the next five years.
Russia has proposed to manufacture helicopters in India.
There is a strong support in all major economies for our “Make in India” programme.
Similarly, with Bangladesh we have settled the land boundary issue.
We are working with a spirit of mutual benefit.
There is no question of bullying anyone.
Our recent help to Nepal during the natural calamity shows that our approach is brotherly.
With Pakistan too, we will pursue our long-standing approach.
We will continue our efforts to advance cooperation and connectivity, without compromising our national security.
12. If we were to return to domestic issues, you have come for criticism from many for not being able to reign in vitriolic elements in your party who have made disparaging remarks against minorities.
What do you say?
The tradition of welcoming, respecting and honouring all faiths is as old as India itself.
And that is how it became integral to the Constitution of India.
Our Constitution did not evolve in a vacuum.
It has roots in the ancient cultural traditions of India.
I expect that everyone will understand and respect this.
13. Why do some elements in your party feel emboldened to say awful things even though they ought to know that a Prime Minister of India cannot really support bigots in his cabinet?
I have said this before and I say it again: any discrimination or violence against any community will not be tolerated.
My position on this is very clear: Sab ka saath, sab ka vikas.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi received a telephone call from Mr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada today evening.
Both leaders exchanged views on developments of mutual interest, specifically climate change.

While inaugurating these projects PM said, “We’ve left behind culture of delays”.
He added that his Government will ensure that for all the projects for which foundation stone is laid by him will be inaugurated by him.
He added that, Once Bilaspur-Manali-Leh rail line is completed, the distance from Delhi to Leh will be reduced.
PM laid foundation stone of the new terminal building of Kushok Bakula Rimpochee (KBR) Airport in Leh by unveiling a plaque.
The new terminal will provide seamless passenger movement with all modern amenities.
These projects will He also said that with the projects will result in better availability of electricity, improved connectivity and thus resumore tourist footfalls in the region.
It will also open better livelihood opportunities to many villages.
In addition, Protected Area Permit’s validity has been increased to 15 days.
Now tourists will be able to enjoy their journey to Leh for a longer time.
PM said that a few changes have been made in the LAHDC Act and the Council have been given more rights concerning the expenditures.
Now the Autonomous Council releases the money sent for the region’s development, he added
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to enhance investment by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) in Bharat Oman Refineries Limited (BORL).
The infusion of funds by the BPCLs will enable BORL to overcome the implications on account of the erosion of the net worth.
Besides it will enhance the availability of petroleum products in the Northern and Central parts of the country, industrial development of Madhya Pradesh and substantial increase in employment and tax earnings in the State.
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) is a public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.
It has promoted a joint venture company with Oman Oil Company Limited (OOCL) named Bharat Oman Refineries Limited (BORL).
Currently the refinery is operating at 100% of its installed capacity.
The highlights of the proposal for debottlenecking project include certain modifications to produce products in accordance to the new Auto Fuel Policy.
Hence, there is a need for immediate infusion of funds in BORL by the shareholders.
OOCL while expressing their support for the project, had indicated that they are not prepared to commit further funds for the project at this stage.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the people, on the auspicious occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi
This facility is to be created by MPWLC under PPP mode.
The creation of Centre for Perishable Cargo is expected to cater to the employment needs of the local population and has significant employment potential.
A total number of 113 persons will be required to manage the CPC.
The State Government of Madhya Pradesh has brought out that the CPC is proposed to be set up at Devi Ahilya Bai Airport, Indore.
The move comes in the backdrop of huge demand of export of pharmaceuticals, poultry products and horticulture products in Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh.
The leasing out of the land will enable State Government of Madhya Pradesh to promote its agriculture and Horticulture sector by establishment of Centre for Perishable Cargo at Indore airport.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post-facto approval to the Letter of Intent signed on 10.2.2016 between the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship of India and the National Qualifications Authority of the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E).
The Letter of Intent will strengthen relations between the two countries and pave the way for bilateral cooperation between the two countries on skill development and recognition of qualifications.
Following this, the Cabinet has also given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU) between the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship of India and the National Qualifications Authority of the U.A.E. for cooperation in skill development and recognition of qualifications.
The MoU will pave the way for bilateral cooperation between the two countries on skill development and recognition of qualifications.
Also the MoU will facilitate workforce mobility, skill development and placement of youth in overseas jobs in UAE.
India’s tradition of celebrating festivals has been one to strengthen our love for nature and to develop each individual, right from childhood, as a cultured person.
And, this darkness here does not merely signify the absence of light; it is also the darkness of superstition and blind-faith, darkness of ignorance, darkness of poverty and also darkness of social evils.
From countries of the East to those of the West, from developed nations to developing nations and from countries of Africa to Ireland – everywhere we can see the glow and revelry of Deepawali.
But, at times children indulge in reckless bravado and take unnecessary risks.
With a string of festive events such as Govardhan Puja, Bhai Dooj, Laabh Panchmi till Kartik Purnima – this festival of lights goes on for quite a long period of time.
Schools, colleges, students, villages, the underprivileged, traders, shopkeepers, political leaders, sportspersons, people from the cine world have all lit a lamp for the country’s Jawans, have joined in this campaign of sending a message of greetings and salutation to our Jawans.
What great responsibilities they have on their shoulders!
Those blessed with the blessings of Goddess Saraswati composed poems and couplets.
Some came up with inspiring and motivating slogans.
Ashwani ji has written: –
I celebrate the festival, feel happy and smile
I sleep peacefully;
I sleep peacefully, because you are guarding the borders there
The mountains, the skies and the country bow to you
I too bow in gratitude to you O brave soldier!
The “Sandesh to Soldiers” campaign has been launched on this Deepawali and is proving to be a morale booster for our brothers.
But how is this success achieved?
It came to my attention, that in the remote forests of Kerala where there is no path to tread upon and only after walking an entire day, some villages can be reached with difficulty; a tribal village panchayat named Idmalakudi is there.
But a phone call from a gentleman from Punjab and his pain touched me: –
“Pradhan Mantriji namaskar, Sir, I am Jasdeep speaking from Punjab.
But the pain remains that Sardar Patel, who lived for India’s unity, strove tirelessly for it, had to even endure some unpleasantness on account of it, but never ever abandoned the path of unity; but on the birth anniversary of this great SARDAR, thousands of Sardars, the family members of thousands of Sardars were killed in the aftermath of the assassination of Smt.
That is India’s great characteristic quality.
Making the freedom movement a source of strength in the villages was Sardar Saheb’s big achievement, a result of his organizational capacity and capability.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has expressed grief on the loss of lives of CRPF personnel in Bihar.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has expressed pride and happiness over the induction of Tejas fighter jet into the Air Force.
Prime Minister also lauded Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) on the induction of Tejas.
This illustrates our skills and strengths to enhance indigenous defence manufacturing”, the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding signed between India and Romania in the field of tourism.

The signing of Memorandum of Understanding with Romania will be instrumental in increasing arrival from this source market.
The Governor of Maharashtra Shri Ch.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the NCC Rally in New Delhi.
He said that whenever he is among the NCC cadets, he is filled with nostalgia.
He expressed happiness that in the last one year, NCC cadets have been associated with several important initiatives, such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Digital Transactions etc.
He said their contribution to the relief and rescue efforts during the Kerala floods was especially praiseworthy.
The Prime Minister said that today, the whole world looks upon India as a shining star.
He said that there is now a perception that India not only has a lot of potential, but is also fulfilling that potential.

The Union Cabinet under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for placing the new Instrument adopted by International Labour Organization (ILO) – Recommendations concerning ‘The Transition from the Informal to the Formal Economy (No.204)’ before the Parliament.
Its adoption was supported by India, represented at the Session by the Union Minister of State for Labour & Employment.
Under Article 19 of the ILO Constitution, each Member State of the ILO is required to submit the instruments adopted by the Conference before the competent authority (the Parliament in case of India) within a period of one year from the closing session of the Conference.
The Recommendation provides guidance to Members to facilitate the transition of workers and economic units from the informal to the formal economy while respecting workers’ fundamental rights and promote creation, preservation and sustainability of enterprises and decent jobs in the formal economy and prevent informalization of formal economy jobs.
There is no financial implication on India in adopting the ILO Recommendation, which is applicable to all workers in the country which ratifies the instrument.
Background:-
ILO Conventions are international treaties, open for ratification by member countries.
The ratification of an ILO Convention is a voluntary process.
A Protocol is an instrument that partially modifies a Convention.
As regards formal ratification of the Convention and Protocol to the Convention, the same is to be decided separately by Government keeping in view the national laws and practices.
Given the diversity of the informal economy across member States, the competent authority should identify the nature and extent of the informal economy as described in this Recommendation, and its relationship to the formal economy using Tripartite mechanisms.
In designing coherent and integrated strategies to facilitate the transition to the formal economy, the Recommendation encourages members to take into account the diversity of characteristics, circumstances and needs of workers and economic units in the informal economy.
It also seeks to take into account specific national circumstances, legislation, policies, practices and priorities, effective promotion and protection of the human rights and promotion of gender equality and non-discrimination.
On the margins of the ongoing G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Prime Minister Modi had a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe.
Prime Minister Modi expressed satisfaction at developments in bilateral relations since then.
As I arrived in Aizawl a short while ago, I was thrilled to witness once again, the enchanting beauty of Mizoram: the “Land of the Hill People.”
A land of peace and calm.
A people so warm and hospitable.
A State with one of the highest literacy rates in India.
Projects stuck for years, are now progressing.
Self Help Groups are also benefiting through credit linkages provided by the North Eastern Development Finance Corporation, with interest subsidy being provided by the Union Government.
I am told, the Ministry for Development of the North-East Region is also supporting the activities of the North Eastern Handicrafts and Handloom Development Corporation; and the North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation.
These Public Sector Under-takings are engaged in training and hand holding artisans, weavers and farmers, for marketing and food processing.
Today we gather here to celebrate a significant mile-stone in the history of Mizoram:
The completion and dedication of the 60 Mega-Watt Tuirial Hydro-power Project.
This comes13 years after the last major central sector hydro-power project in the North-Eastern Region–the Kopili Stage-II.
Tuirial Hydro-power project is the first major Central Sector Project to be successfully commissioned in Mizoram.
It is the first large hydro-power project in the State.
With the commissioning of this project, Mizoram becomes the third power-surplus State in the North-East, after Sikkim and Tripura.
Besides generating electricity, the reservoir water will also open new avenues for navigation.
This will provide connectivity to remote villages.
The huge reservoir, spread over an area of 45 square kilometers, can also be used for development of fisheries.
I see no reason why Mizoram cannot become a net-power exporter.
Our aim is not just to make the North Eastern States power surplus.
We also aim to develop a state-of-art transmission system which ensures that surplus power is transferred to other power deficient parts of the country.
My Government is investing close to Rupees10,000 crores for a comprehensive improvement in the power transmission system in the North Eastern States.
I am convinced that States are the main drivers of change.
We have taken a number of initiatives to infuse healthy competition among States.
A Committee of Chief Ministers made recommendations to rationalize Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
We duly accepted the recommendations.
Despite fiscal constraints, the sharing pattern of core centrally sponsored schemes for North Eastern States has been continued at 90-10.
For other schemes, it stands at 80-20.
Friends, The vision of New India can be realized only if the fruits of development reach all.
The Union Government has plans to focus on around 115 districts which are relatively backward when evaluated on various social indicators.
This will also benefit the backward districts of North Eastern States including Mizoram.
Just yesterday, we approved a new Central Sector Scheme.
The North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme will fill the gaps in creation of infrastructure in two sectors.
One sector is physical infrastructure relating to water supply, power, connectivity and especially projects promoting tourism.
The other is social sector projects of education and health.
The new Scheme will be 100 percent centrally funded as against the NLCPR, where 10 percent contribution had to come from the State Governments.
The Central Government will be providing Rupees 5300 Crore to North Eastern States under the Scheme over the next three years.
We are committed to bring all the State Capitals of North East Region on the Rail map.
The Government of India is executing 15 New Rail Line projects of 1385 kilometers length, at a cost of over Rs.47,000 crore.
The railways reached Mizoram last year, with the inauguration of the rail line connecting Bhairabi in Mizoram with Silchar in Assam.
I had laid the foundation for a new line to take rail connectivity to Aizawl in 2014.
With the support of the State Government, we shall connect the State Capital Aizawl with broad gauge rail line.
The Union Government has been proactively following the ‘Act East Policy’.
As a gate-way to South East Asia, Mizoram stands to gain immensely from this.
It can emerge as a key transit point for trade with Myanmar and Bangladesh.
Various bilateral projects are at various stages of completion.
Some of the major initiatives include the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, the Rih-Tedim Road Project and Border Haats.
Friends, The high literacy rate, scenic beauty and availability of large English speaking population in Mizoram make for a perfect blend to develop the State as a model tourist destination.
The State offers significant scope for adventure tourism, cultural tourism, eco-tourism, wild-life tourism, and community-based rural tourism.
The Government is also committed to provide assistance for maintenance and up-keep of various wild-life sanctuaries and national parks in Mizoram with a view to attract tourists.
You could not transport or sell the Bamboo produced in your own field without a permit.
Our Government with an aim to reduce this pain, has changed the regulatory regime.
These include the Olympian Archer C. Lalremsanga , boxer Ms. Jenny Lalremliani, weight lifter Ms. Lalchhahimi, and hockey player Ms. Lalruatfeli.
I once again wish you all and the people of Mizoram a Merry Christmas.
The mandate exercised and approach adopted at the Conference was aimed at protecting India’s interests, priorities and concerns during the Ministerial Conference.
In the run-up to the Conference, decisions were expected on a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes as per the Bali/Nairobi mandate and other agriculture issues.
Some WTO member countries were seeking outcomes on domestic regulations in services, disciplines on fisheries subsidies, E-commerce, Investment Facilitation and Micro, Medium and Small Enterprises (MSMEs).
However, ultimately, there was no outcome on public stockholding for food security purposes or on other agriculture issues due to an absence of consensus.
Thus, India’s foodgrain procurement programmes at Minimum Support Prices remain protected.
Ministerial decisions taken during the Conference include a Work Programme on disciplines on Fisheries Subsidies with a view to arriving at a decision by the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the WTO, in 2019.
It was also decided to continue with the non-negotiating mandate of the existing Work Programme on E-Commerce, as proposed by India.
As was done in previous Ministerial Conferences, an existing moratorium on imposing customs duties on electronic transmission was expanded for two years.
However, wide support was expressed for the multilateral trading system and the commitment to move forward on various areas of work in the WTO.

The decision comes in the wake of the long pending demand of people of Tripura as well as the Tripura Government for paying tribute to Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore.
Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore, who ascended the throne of the erstwhile Tripura Princely State in 1923, was an enlightened and benevolent ruler.
Agartala Airport was constructed in 1942 on the land donated by Maharaja Bir Bikram Manikya Kishore.
As a visionary ruler, who had travelled extensively across the globe, he took several steps for the all-round development of Tripura.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) between India and Japan.

The MoC will enable establishment and promotion of closer and long-term cooperation between India and Japan in the field of environment protection and management of natural resources on the basis of equity, reciprocity and mutual benefits, taking into account the applicable laws and legal provisions in each country.
Officials briefed the Prime Minister on progress in various areas of scientific research.
Giving the example of talent spotting in sports, the Prime Minister said that mechanisms should be made to identify the brightest and best science talent among school students.
He said that a lot of innovation is happening at the grassroots level.
Urging officials to break silos, the Prime Minister strongly emphasized that a mechanism should be formed to document and replicate successful innovations at the grassroots level.
In this context, he also mentioned innovations being done by defence personnel.
In the agriculture sector, the Prime Minister identified high-protein pulses, fortified foods, and value addition in castor, as priority areas which needed to be speeded up.
In the energy sector, the Prime Minister said that the possibilities of solar energy should be pursued to the maximum, to reduce dependence on energy imports.
Expressing confidence in the abilities of Indian scientists to rise up to the challenges, and provide solutions to improve the lives of the common man in India, the Prime Minister asked the officials to draw up clear targets to be achieved by 2022, the 75th year of independence.

There is no additional financial implication as the approval is to extend the time line to cover two thirds of the vulnerable households in the State within in the originally approved financial outlay of Rs. 755.32 crore.
An amount of Rs.143.604 crore will be required for the period of one year during 2018-19.
1. This will help in covering all the vulnerable rural households in the State (estimated at two thirds of the total number of households) within a definite time frame.
2. It will ensure mobilization of households under the auto inclusion category and households with at least one deprivation category listed in the Socio Economic Caste Census – 2011.
3. It will also ensure coverage of all the blocks in Jammu & Kashmir under DAY-NRLM and ensures social inclusion, social development, promotion of livelihoods leading to poverty alleviation in the State.
Due to unavoidable reasons and disturbed conditions in the State, the Special Package as approved in May 2013 could not be fully implemented.
Now, the State Government has requested Government of India to consider extension of the earlier approved implementation schedule of the Special Package and continued funding of DAY-NRLM in Jammu and Kashmir on a demand driven basis without linking allocation with poverty ratio during this extended period.
Hence the approval by the Cabinet which will give a boost to the vulnerable rural families in Jammu & Kashmir.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) for farmers for the year 2017-18.
This will help farmers getting short term crop loan up to Rs. 3 lakh payable within one year at only 4% per annum.
The Government has earmarked a sum of Rs. 20,339 crore for this purpose.
The salient features of the scheme are as follows:
Farmers will thus have to effectively pay only 4% as interest.
In case farmers do not repay the short term crop loan in time they would be eligible for interest subvention of 2% as against 5% available above.
Credit is a critical input in achieving high productivity and overall production in the agricultural sector.
The Cabinet’s approval of a sum of Rs.20,339 crore to meet various obligations arising from interest subvention being provided to the farmers on short term crop loans, as also loans on post harvest storages meets an important input requirement of the farmers in the country.
An important initiative of the government is market reforms, with a view to ensuring that the farmers benefit from remunerative prices for their produce in the market.
The loans are available to Kisan Credit Card (KCC) holding small and marginal farmers at interest subvention of 2 per cent on such storages for a period of upto six months.
It is, therefore, needful for the small and marginal farmers to keep their KCCs alive.
The credit from institutional sources will complement all such government initiatives like Soil Health Card, Input Management, Per Drop More Crop in Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sichai Yojana (PMKSY), PMFBY, e-NAM, etc.
The scheme has been running since 2006-07.
Under this, the farmers can avail concessional crop loans of upto Rs.3 lakh at 7% rate of interest.
It also provides for an additional subvention of 3%.
Prompt Repayment within a period of one year from the date of advance.
As a measure to check distress sale, post-harvest loans for storage in accredited warehouses against Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) are available for upto 6 months for KCC holding small & marginal farmers.
During the year 2016-17, the volume of short term crop loan lent stood at Rs.6,22,685 crore, surpassing the target of Rs. 6,15,000 crore.
Attention: Brief for Electronic Media
In effect, crop loans are available to farmers at 4% rate of interest.
The scheme also envisages other benefits including interest at concessional rate of 7% for storage in ware houses accredited by Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority (WDRA) for upto 6 months post harvest for avoiding distress sale.
Your Excellency, Prime Minister Abe, Members of the media,
I am delighted to welcome Prime Minister Abe to India.
It is a great pleasure to host a personal friend and a great champion of India-Japan partnership.
No partner has played such a decisive role in India’s economic transformation as Japan.
No friend will matter more in realising India’s economic dreams than Japan.
And, I cannot think of a strategic partnership that can exercise a more profound influence on shaping the course of Asia and our interlinked ocean regions more than ours.
That is why we deeply value our Special Strategic and Global Partnership”.
It enjoys unmatched public goodwill and political consensus in India.
It also comes with great public expectations and huge responsibilities for us.
In the course of the past year, we have done much to live up to them.
We have made enormous progress in economic cooperation as also in our regional partnership and security cooperation.
Prime Minister Abe has been prompt and positive on our economic proposals, many of which are now unique to India.
Japanese private investments are also rising sharply.
Today, we have scaled new summits in our shared journey.
The Memorandum we signed on civil nuclear energy cooperation is more than just an agreement for commerce and clean energy.
It is shining symbol of a new level of mutual confidence and strategic partnership in the cause of a peaceful and secure world.
I know the significance of this decision for Japan.
And, I assure you that India deeply respects that decision and will honour our shared commitments.
No less historic is our decision to introduce High Speed Rail on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad sector through the Japan’s Shinkansen, known for its speed, reliability and safety.
We greatly appreciate Prime Minister Abe’s extraordinary package of approximately 12 billion U.S. dollars and technical assistance, on very easy terms, for this project.
This enterprise will launch a revolution in Indian railways and speed up India’s journey into the future.
It will become an engine of economic transformation in India.
We also appreciate the sharp increase in Japanese bilateral assistance programme and the strength of public and private Japanese commitment for the Make in India mission.
In September 2014 in Tokyo Prime Minister Abe spoke of 35 billion U.S. dollars of Japanese finance and investments for India over five years.
But, together we are quickly turning it into reality.

Following is the text of the Prime Minister’s letter:-
“You are aware that ever since our Government came into office, I have been working to strengthen our federal polity and promote cooperative federalism.
Therefore, since the very beginning, we have been committed to a rapid and inclusive process of growth.
Looking to the diversity of the country, we understand that real and functional Federal Governance is the only vehicle to achieve this objective quickly and holistically.
I sincerely believe that strong states are the foundation of a strong India.
Even as Chief Minister, I had been saying that the progress of the country depends on the progress of states.
This Government is, therefore, committed to the idea of empowering states in all possible ways.
Such a vision and the concrete steps that all of us take will help in realising the development aspirations of our people.
It is in this context that we have wholeheartedly accepted the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, although it puts a tremendous strain on the Centre’s finances.
The 14th FC has recommended a record increase of 10% in the devolution of the divisible pool of resources to states.
This compares with the marginal increases made by previous Finance Commissions.
The total devolution to states in 2015-16 will be significantly higher than in 2014-15.
This naturally leaves far less money with the Central Government.
However, we have taken the recommendations of the 14th FC in a positive spirit as they strengthen your hand in designing and implementing schemes as per your priorities and needs.
In making its recommendations, the 14th FC has made a fundamental shift in the pattern of financing revenue expenditures.
Therefore, there is a shift from scheme and grant based support from the Central Government to a devolution based support.
Hence, the devolution of 42% of divisible resources.
Therefore, as per the 14th FC, all State Plan Revenue expenditure has to be met from the resources being devolved to states.
In spite of this large devolution, we have decided to continue with some support to topmost areas of national priority such as poverty elimination, MNREGA, education, health, rural development, agriculture and a few other areas.
States have always been voicing their opposition to this philosophy for years.
States are free to continue or change these schemes and programmes as per their discretion and requirement.
In all these, the Union Government, particularly the NITI Aayog, will support states in developing a strategy and in its execution through ideas, knowledge and technology.
This is all towards the fulfilment of my promise of co-operative federalism.
As you have already seen, we have decided to involve states in discussing and planning national priorities.
This is being done so as to maximise the outcome from every rupee spent either at the centre or the state.
It was with this spirit of Team India that all Chief Ministers have been made equal partners in the Governing Council of NITI Aayog.
This is our strategy to take the country to a faster and yet inclusive growth trajectory through co-operative federalism which is real and true federalism.
We are happy with our decision and that resources are going to the right place.
Resources are going to states to ensure that poverty is eliminated, jobs are created; houses, drinking water, roads, schools, hospitals and electricity are provided.
This has never happened in this country before.
Resources, thus, are not and will not be a problem.
The issue is the direction and intent of our policies and our capacity to implement.
The focus should be the poor, farmers and common men and women, the youth and children.
The challenge is to address the factors which inhibit the realisation of their full potential.
This is a golden opportunity in our Nation’s economic development process.
My recent visits across the world have shown that there is a lot of optimism about India and interest in investing here.
Everyone wants to partner with India in its growth story.
This is not an opportunity for the central government, but an opportunity for India as a whole.
Let us aim at a quantum leap in the process of our Nation’s development.
We should also adopt a rigorous system of evaluation of schemes and projects.
I will work with you in this effort.
Together, we have to establish benchmarks in terms of quality of works and their speedy execution.
Let us work together in this direction.
I will be available for any consultation in this regard at any time.”

The Government of India attaches the highest priority to job creation.
India suffers from a lack of reliable, timely data on employment which has made it difficult for policy makers and independent observers to assess the extent of employment generation at different points of time.
The net result has been that both policy making and analysis are conducted in a data vacuum.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the concluding session of the Conference of Governors at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal –
to provide land on lease to Hindustan Urvarak & Rasayan Limited (HURL);
to provide the Concession Agreements & Land Lease Agreements for the revival of Gorakhpur & Sindri units of Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited (FCIL) and Barauni unit of Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited (HFCL) by HURL; and
to authorize Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) to approve Substitution Agreements and approve other agreements, if any to be signed between FCIL/HFCL and HURL for the three projects at Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni.
The revival of Gorakhpur, Sindri and Barauni units of FCIL/HFCL will ensure substantial investment in the fertilizer sector.
In order to facilitate HURL to set up the fertilizer projects at the three locations, Lease Deeds are to be signed with HURL by FCIL/HFCL.
The lease of land is for a period of 55 years.
The Lessee (HURL) would pay a nominal Lease Rent of Rs.1 lakh per annum to the Lessor (FCIL/HFCL).
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to amend regulation for foreign investment in the Non- Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs).
Foreign investment in “Other Financial Services”, which are not regulated by any regulators / Government Agency, can be made on approval route.
Further, minimum capitalisation norms as mandated under FDI policy have been eliminated as most of the regulators have already fixed minimum capitalisation norms.
This will induce FDI and spurt economic activities.
It will cover whole India and is not limited to any State/Districts.
In the Budget 2016-17 Speech, the Hon’ble Finance Minister had announced that “FDI will be allowed beyond the 18 specified NBFC activities in the automatic route in other activities which are regulated by financial sector regulators”.
The present regulations on “Non-Banking Finance Companies” stipulates that FDI would be allowed on automatic route for only 18 specified NBFC activities after fulfilling prescribed minimum capitalisation norms mentioned therein.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Economic Times Global Business Summit.
He said from the days of 2013-14, when India was beset with problems such as runaway inflation, high fiscal deficit and policy paralysis, change is clearly visible today.
Hesitations have been replaced by hope, and obstacles have been replaced by optimism, he said.
The Prime Minister said that since 2014,India has made significant improvements in almost all international rankings and indices.
He said rankings are mostly lagging indicators, which change only after things have changed on the ground.
In this context, he gave the example of Ease of Doing Business, where several parameters have visibly improved.
The Prime Minister drew a contrast between different forms of competition between now and prior to 2014.
He said that the competition now is on development, and achieving aspirational targets such as total sanitation, or total electrification, or higher investment.
By contrast, he said that earlier, the apparent competition seemed to be on delays and corruption.
The Prime Minister strongly criticized what he described as a “narrative” that certain things are just impossible in India.
The impossible is now possible, he declared, as he spoke of the progress made in making India clean and corruption free; in the poorleveraging the power of technology, and in removing discretion and arbitrariness in policy making.
He said that a perception had been made that governments cannot be pro-growth and pro-poor at the same time,but people of India are making it possible.
He said that during 2014 to 2019, the country would register average growth of 7.4 percent and the average inflation would be less than four and a half percent.
Post liberalization of the Indian economy, this will be the highest rate of average growth and lowest rate of average inflation witnessed during the period of any government, he added.
In the last four years, the amount of Foreign Direct Investment received in the country was almost equal to what was received in seven years before 2014, the Prime Minister said.
He added that to achieve this, India needed reforms to transform.
Through the Bankruptcy Code, GST, Real Estate Act to name a few, a solid foundation for decades of higher growth has been laid, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that India is a country of 130 crore aspirations and there can never be a singular vision for development and progress.
“Our vision of new India caters to all sections of the society, irrespective of their economic profile, their caste, creed, language and religion,” he added.
Shri Narendra Modi said “our vision of New India includes addressing the challenges of the future while also solving problems of the past.”
In this context, he gave the following examples:
While India has made its fastest train, it has also eliminated all un-manned railway crossings.
While India is buildingIITs & AIIMS at a rapid pace, it has also built toilets in all schools across the country.
While India is building a 100 smart cities across the country, it is also ensuring rapid progress in over 100 aspirational districts.
While India has become a net exporter of electricity, it has also ensured that crores of households which were in darkness since independence have got electricity.
Speaking of positive interventions in the social sector, the Prime Minister said that the Government is reaching out to twelve crore small and marginal farmers by providing them a comfort of rupees six thousand every year.
This will transfer 7.5 lakh crore rupees or about one hundred billion dollars to our farmers over the next ten years, he added.
The outcomes of our focus on Digital India, Start-up India, Make In India and Innovate India are converging and reaping rich dividends, the Prime Minister said.
44 percent of the startups registered in India are from tier 2 and tier3 cities, he added.
Technology is bridging the gap between the haves and have-nots in our country, he said.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has wished Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his birthday.

Prime Minister will also be attending Annual G-20 Leaders Summit in Hangzhou, China from 3rd September 2016 to 5th September 2016.
In a series of posts from his Facebook account the Prime Minister said:
“Greetings to the people of Vietnam on their National Day.
My Government attaches a high priority to our bilateral relations with Vietnam.
The India-Vietnam partnership will benefit Asia and the rest of the world.
During the visit, I will hold extensive discussions with Prime Minister Mr. Nguyen Xuan Phuc.
I will also meet the President of Vietnam, Mr. Tran Dai Quang, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Mr. Nguyen Phu Trong; and the Chairperson of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Ms. Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan.
We wish to forge a strong economic relationship with Vietnam that can mutually benefit our citizens.
I will arrive in Hangzhou from Vietnam where I would have concluded an important bilateral visit.
During the G-20 Summit, I will have an opportunity to engage with other world leaders on pressing international priorities and challenges.
Your Excellencies,
President of the New Development Bank
Members of the BRICS Business Council
I am pleased to participate in this meeting with the BRICS Business Council.
The work you do in the Business Council plays a vital role in giving practical shape to the vision of BRICS partnership.
At this meeting last year in Goa, there was a suggestion on closer cooperation between the NDB and BRICS Business Council.
I am happy to note that you are entering into an MOU with the NDB.
India is changing fast into one of the most open economies in the world today.
Foreign Direct Investment inflows are at an all-time high, rising by 40 per cent.
The Goods and Services Tax that was introduced in July is India’s biggest economic reform measure ever.
In one stroke, a unified market of 1.3 billion people has been created.
Programmes like Digital India, Start Up India and Make in India are changing the economic landscape of the country.
I am happy to note that the BRICS Business Council also has matching priorities of trade & investment facilitation, promoting skills development, infrastructure development, SME Development, e-commerce and digital economy.
Many productive recommendations have come out of your deliberations.
Your work towards establishment of a BRICS Rating Agency, energy cooperation, green finance, and digital economy is particularly noteworthy.
Let me conclude by saying that as Governments, we will offer full support to your endeavours.
And we also count on the BRICS Business Council to take us closer to our common objective of improving business and investment cooperation.
Swami Nirvinananda ji and all the devotees of Sri Sri Thakur Ramakrishna Paramhansa assembled here today, greetings.
When I think of the words of a great mind from Bengal, translated into Malayalam, being read and debated in Kerala, I am humbled by how ideas are shared and adapted across our country.
What could be a better example of Ek Bharat…Shreshtha Bharat?
This practice that you have started builds on a long tradition of making the teachings of the scriptures, the words of great gurus available to the common people.
This is part of the long oral tradition of India that has evolved constantly to adapt to changing times and circumstances, keeping the eternal values intact.
The shrutis, the four Vedas and Upanishads are the source of Dharma: they are sacred knowledge transmitted by great Indian sages from generation to generation.
Shrutis are believed to be revealed divine knowledge, transmitted orally.
Smriti is a class of texts that are based on memory and interpretation.
Since the Vedas and the Upanishads were difficult to understand for common people, the smritis were written to explain, interpret, and clarify primary revelation through stories and moral lessons.
Thus it is clear that the epics, Puranas and the Arthasastra of Kautilya are all smritis.
The effort to reach every person through the means that are best suited to them continued over time.
To reach the common people, there was a need to make dharma, or right living, more accessible, closer to their daily lives.
The Bhagvat describes Devarshi Narada, singing the praise of God
The bhakti saints used music, poetry, local languages to bring God closer to people – they broke the barriers of caste, class, religion and gender.
The message of the saints was carried further by folk singers, the Katha-vachak, the dastangois.
Kabir’s dohas, Meera’s bhajans were carried by singers from village to village.
India is a land that is blessed with a rich cultural and intellectual milieu.
Our land is home to writers, scholars, saints and seers who have expressed themselves freely and fearlessly.
And whenever the history of human civilization has entered the era of knowledge, India has shown the way.
A false perception was created about India that India needed social, political and economic reform initiated by outsiders.
This became a reason to justify colonialism too.
Such notions were absolutely false because India’s soil is that soil from where change has always originated.
And this change originated from within, driven by our saints and seers who made it their mission to transform society and undertake mass movements to eradicate evils that may have entered into our society.
Our Saints integrated each and every citizen in their quest for social reform.
Nobody was left outside the ambit.
This is why our civilization stands tall, overcoming obstacles.
Those civilizations that did not change with time vanished.
We, on the other hand even altered practices over centuries.
Some practice may have been prevalent a few centuries ago but if it was felt redundant, it was altered.
We have always been open to new ideas.
Through our history, our Saints did things that may seem small but their impact was big and this altered the course of our history.
Long before any faith, any culture, India had women saints who took up the issue of gender equality.
They wrote fearlessly and expressed themselves through their powerful writings.
The scriptures say:
Could there be a better example of a teacher setting standards for the advancement of society?
He was a part of the tradition of Bhakti saints and in the Kathamrit we find many references to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu – his trances, his songs, his utter devotion.
But he renewed the tradition and made it stronger.
He broke the mental barriers that keep us apart barriers between religions, between castes.
He was the saint of social harmony.
His message is that of tolerance, of devotion, of surrendering oneself to the divine of One Lord with different names – the gyaani, the yogi, and the devotee.
“The same Being whom gyaanis call Brahma – the Absolute, is called Atma – Universal Soul, by yogis, and Bhagavan – Personal God with divine attributes, by devotees.
He lived the Muslim way of life, he lived the Christian way of life, he practised tantra.
He found that there were many ways to the divine, but followed with devotion, they all lead to one goal.
“The Reality is one and the same;” he said, ” the difference is in name and form.”
In Kerala you call it ‘Vellam.’
His teachings are particularly relevant to us today, when we are confronted with people who use religion, caste to divide and create animosity.
Mahatma Gandhi said: Ramakrishna’s life enables us to see God face to face.
No one can read the story of his life without being convinced that God alone is real and that all else is an illusion.
Sri Ramakrishna is a link between the ancient and the modern.
He showed how the ancient ideals and experiences could be realized even while following the modern way of life.
Simple anecdotes, simple messages – told simply.
But due to their very simplicity, these were embedded in the minds of the listeners.
If we had not a teacher like this, would there have been a disciple like Swami Vivekananda?
The great karmayogi took forward the thought of his guru –
Jatra Jeev, Tatra Shiv – wherever there is a living being, there is Shiva;
Swami Vivekananda said – Where should you go to seek God?
Are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, god?
Why not worship them first?
Let these people be your God.
His clarion call -“Now is wanted intense Karma-Yoga with un-bounded courage and indomitable strength in the heart.
Ramakrishna Mission’s record of service is evidence of this commitment.
We find the mission in poor areas, among tribals, in areas stricken by need or disaster trying to alleviate suffering.
On the website of the Mission,
For one’s own salvation and for the welfare of the world.

Your Excellencies, President Tusk and President Juncker,
I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome President Tusk and President Juncker for the 14th India-EU Summit.
India was amongst the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the European Economic Community in 1962.
The European Union has been our largest trade partner for a long time.
It is also one of our largest sources of Foreign Direct Investment.
As the world’s largest democracies, we are natural partners.
Our close relations are founded on the shared values of democracy, rule of law, respect for fundamental freedoms and multiculturalism.
We also share the vision of a multi-polar, rules-based international order.
I am heartily thankful to President Tusk and President Juncker for the productive discussions that we have had today on our wide-ranging agenda.
We have agreed to strengthen our security cooperation and work together against terrorism.
We will not only further strengthen our bilateral cooperation on this issue, but will also increase our cooperation and coordination in multilateral fora.
On Clean Energy and Climate Change, we are both committed to the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Addressing climate change and promoting secure, affordable and sustainable supplies of energy are our shared priorities.
We also reaffirmed our commitment to undertake mutual cooperation for reducing the cost of deployment of renewable energy.
We will strengthen our cooperation with European Union in developing Smart Cities and upgrading urban infrastructure.
I am pleased that the India-EU Horizontal Civil Aviation Agreement has now been operationalized.
I am confident that this will enhance air connectivity between us and help to foster people-to-people contact.
An important aspect of our relationship is our cooperation in Science and Technology, and in Research and Innovation.
In this context, I welcome the Agreement concluded today on mobility of young scientists and researchers.
Your Excellencies,
I thank you for your leadership and your contribution to the strengthening of the India EU strategic Partnership.
It is my hope and expectation that your next visit to India would not be such a brief one!
Joint Interpretative Declarations/Statements in general play an important supplementary role in strengthening the investment treaty regime.
With increasing Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) disputes, issuance of such statements is likely to have strong persuasive value before arbitration tribunals.
The lofty dream of One Nation – One Tax has finally been fulfilled.
The heroes of our freedom struggle with their single-minded devotion did a ‘Tapasya’, endured hardships, made great sacrifices and even laid down their lives; what greater inspiration could there be!
The reason for this entire success was the people’s support, people’s resolve, and people’s struggle.
In this month of August, we have to come together and resolve: Filth – Quit India; Poverty – Quit India; Corruption – Quit India; Terrorism – Quit India; Casteism – Quit India; Communalism – Quit India!
The need for today is not ‘Do or Die’, instead it is to resolve, to come together, persevere, and work relentlessly with our utmost strength towards the making of a new India.
Come let’s launch a mega campaign Sankalp se Siddhi – Attainment through Resolve, from the 9th of this August.
I would particularly like to call upon the online world, since wherever we may be, we are almost always online; so I would like to invite the online community and specially my young friends to come forward and contribute innovatively for building of the New India.
Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, Ganesh Utsav, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Pooja, Diwali – these will be observed one after the other.
Rakhi makers and their sellers, sweets shops vendors – the professions of hundreds, thousands flourish on the occasion of a festival.
125 years and 1.25 billion countrymen!
And we must think anew ways to steer Community Ganesh Festivals in consonance with the sentiments of Tilak ji.
My dear countrymen, we are continually seeing that our daughters are bringing laurels to the country in all the fields – be it education, economic activities, social spheres or in sports – they are scaling new heights.
A very good morning to all of you.
I am happy to be here once again with you at the Global Business Summit.
Let me first compliment you for choosing the word Social as the first word of your theme for a business summit;
And when you talk about Scalability which is the third word of the theme for this summit, it gives me hope and confidence that you are indeed discussing solutions for India.
Who would know better than all of you present here about the challenges the country was facing during the second half of 2013 and early 2014;
Run-away inflation was breaking the back of every house-hold.
Increasing current account deficit and higher fiscal deficit were threateningthe macro-economic stability of the country.
All these parameters were indicating a gloomy future;
The country was facing total policy paralysis.
This was preventing the economy from reaching the level which it was worthy of;
The global fraternity was worried about the health of this member of fragile five club.
There was a perception of surrender to existing circumstances
Obstacles have been replaced by optimism.
Issues have been replaced by initiatives.
Since 2014,India has made significant improvements in almost all international rankings and indices.
This not only shows how India is changing but also represents how the world’s perception about India is changing.
I am aware that there are some who cannot appreciate this rapid improvement.
They suggest that rankings only improve things on paper, but nothing changes on the ground.
I think this is far from the truth.
Rankings are mostly lagging indicators.
Things change on ground first, but reflect in rankings after a time lag.
Take the example of Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Our rankings have improved from 142 to a historic high of 77 in four years.
But the change in rankings has been preceded by improvement in situation on the ground.
Now construction permits for starting a new business come faster, and sodo electricity connections and other approvals.
Even for the small traders, compliance is getting easier.
Now a business with a turn-over of upto Rupees sixty lakh does not have to pay any income tax.
In the same way, India’s ranking in the World Travel and TourismCompetitiveness index has gone up from sixty five in 2013 to forty in 2017.
Number of Foreign Tourist Arrivals to India increased by around forty five percent, number of approved hotels went up by fifty percent and
The number of patents and trade-marks filed also show a great increase.
The change is due to a new style of governance and is often visible in interesting ways.
I would like to give you such an interesting example of how things have changed since 2014.
a competition on development,
as to which aspirational district will progress fastest.
There was competition as to whether coal will get more money or spectrum.
I will leave it to you to decide which form of competition you would prefer.
For decades,a narrative was made that certain things are just impossible in India.
It was said that a corruption free government in India was impossible, but people of India have made it possible.
It was said that it is impossible to remove corruption from the process of giving people their due, but people of India are making it possible.
It was said that it is impossible for the poor to leverage the power of technology, but the people of India are making it possible.
It was said that removing discretion and arbitrariness in policy making was impossible, but people of India are making it possible.
It was said that economic reforms in India were impossible, but people of India are making it possible.
It was said that governments cannot be pro-growth and pro-poor at the same time,but people of India are making it possible.
I have also been told, that there is a perception or theory that a developing economy cannot grow at higher rate for a longer period, without facing the problem of inflation;
Post liberalisation that is after 1991, almost all governments formed in our country had to face this problem – what many experts call “over-heating” of economy after a short period of growth.
As a result of this we never had sustainable higher rate of growth.
The government just before us between 2009 to 2014 had an average growth of about six and half percent with an average inflation again in double digit;
During 2014 to 2019, the country would register average growth of seven point four percent and the average inflation would be less than four and half percent;
Post liberalisation of Indian economy, this will be the highest rate of average growth and lowest rate of average inflation witnessed during the period of any government.
With these changes and reforms, transformation is happening in the way our economy has moved.
The Indian economy has expanded the bouquet of its financing resources.
It is no more dependent on banks credit for investment needs.
Take the example of fund raising from the capital market.
During 2011-12 to 2013-14, that is, three years prior to this government,
the average amount of fund raised through equity was about rupees fourteen thousand crore per annum.
This is almost three times.
Our Government took various measures to develop this source of financing in the economy.
And, you can see the result
This is a jump of the order of twenty times.
Similarly let us see the example of private placement of corporate bonds.
In the last four years, the amount of Foreign Direct Investment received in the country was almost equal to what was received in seven years before 2014.
To achieve all this, India needed reforms to transform.
And by having the Bankruptcy Code, GST, Real Estate Act to name a few, – a solid foundation for decades of higher growth has been laid.
This is the impact of Bankruptcy and Insolvency Code.
This will help the country in allocating financial resources more efficiently.
We are working hard to create a New India which fulfils the aspirations and dreams of 130 crore Indians.
Our vision of new India includes addressing the challenges of the future while also solving problems of the past.
So today, while India has made its fastest train, it has also eliminated all un-manned railway crossings.
Today, while India is buildingIITs & AIIMS at a rapid pace, it has also built toilets in all schools across the country.
Today, while India is building a 100 smart cities across the country, it is also ensuring rapid progress in over 100 aspirational districts.
Today, while India has become a net exporter of electricity, it has also ensured that crores of households which were in darkness since independence have got electricity.
Today, while India aims to land on Mars, it is also ensuring that every Indian has a roof over his head.
Today, while India is the fastest growing world economy, it is also removing poverty at the fastest speed.
Instead of burying it, we dug it out and communicated to the people;
Instead of confusing the system, we demonstrated that a solution is possible.
This has given us the confidence to further upscale our positive interventions in the social sector.
We are rolling out a pension scheme for crores of our informal sector workers.
and other providing physical infrastructure for all and particularly for generation next to shape their future as per their dreams.
What happened in the past is not in our hands, but what will happen in the future is firmly in our hands.
We often lament at missing the industrial revolutions in the past, but today it is a matter of pride that India is an active contributor to the fourth Industrial Revolution.
The extent and magnitude of our contribution will surprise the world.
The outcomes of our focus on Digital India, Start-up India, Make In India and Innovate India are converging and reaping rich dividends.
Do you know that while around four thousand patents were granted in 2013 and 2014, more than thirteen thousand patents were granted in 2017-18?
This is a three fold increase!
This is almost a four fold increase!
You would be happy to know that today 44 percent of the startups registered in India are from tier 2 and tier3 cities?
This will give a solid foundation for our students to help them become innovators of tomorrow.
I was impressed to see how a young girl from the snake charmer community was literally charming the mouse and making the most of digital India.
It is equally heartening to see how youth in villages are leveraging Wi-Fi and digital tools to help in clearing competitive exams.
It is technology which is bridging the gap between the haves and have-nots in our country.
Stories like these are writing a new chapter in the history of India.
With the support and partnership of the people, India has made rapid strides since 2014.
This could not have been possible without Jan Bhagidaari.
It is this experience that gives us confidence that our country can provide adequate opportunities to all its citizens, to grow, prosper and excel.
We look forward to making India a ten trillion dollar economy,
We look forward to making India the third largest economy,
We want to make an India of countless startups,
We want to lead the global drive towards renewable sources of energy,
We want to give our people energy security
We want to cut down on import dependence;
We want to make India a world leader in electric vehicles and energy storage devices.
With these goals in mind, let us re-dedicate ourselves to create a New India of our dreams.
I also express grief at the passing away of senior journalist, Thiru R. Mohan.
The Dina Thanthi has completed seventy five glorious years.
Their stellar efforts over the last seven and a half decades, have made Thanthi one of the biggest media brands.
Not just in the State of Tamil Nadu, but in the entire country.
I also compliment the management and staff of the Thanthi group for this success.
24 hour news channels are now available to millions of Indians.
Yet, for many, the day still begins with a cup of tea or coffee in one hand, and a newspaper in the other.
I am told that the Dina Thanthi offers this option today, through seventeen editions, not only in Tamil Nadu but also in Bengaluru, Mumbai and even in Dubai.
The font size, simple language and easy to understand narrative made Dina Thanthi popular among the people.
In those times, it brought them political awareness and information.
People used to throng the tea-shops to read this newspaper.
Over the last seventy five years, the traditional telegram, delivered by the postal department, has become obsolete, and gone out of existence.
But this telegram, continues to grow every day.
Such is the power of a noble idea, backed by hard work and commitment.
I am happy to learn that the Thanthi group has instituted awards for promoting Tamil Literature in the name of its founder Thiru Adithanar.
I whole-heartedly congratulate the awardees: Thiru.
Tamilanban, Dr. Irai Anbu and Thiru.
I am sure, this recognition will be a motivating factor for those who have taken to writing as a noble profession.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Mankind’s quest for knowledge is as old as our history itself.
Journalism helps quench this thirst.
Today, newspapers do not just give news.
They can also mould our thinking and open a window to the world.
In a broader context, media is a means of transforming society.
That is why, we refer to the media, as the fourth pillar of democracy.
I am fortunate today, to be among those who demonstrate the power of the pen, and show how it can be the vital life-force and conscience of society.
During the dark days of colonialism, publications such as the Sambad Kaumudi of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the Kesari of Lokmanya Tilak, and the Navjeevan of Mahatma Gandhi, lit a beacon, and inspired the freedom struggle.
Across the country, there were pioneers in journalism, who often gave up a life of comfort.
They helped create a mass consciousness and awakening, through their newspapers.
We must never forget that successive generations performed the duties required of them, towards society, and the nation.
That is how we achieved freedom.
After independence, the rights of citizens gained importance in public discourse.
Unfortunately, over time we seem to have neglected our individual and collective sense of duty.
This has in some way contributed to several ills that plague our society today.
The need of the hour is to create a mass awakening towards “engaged, responsible, and aware citizens.”
The civic sense of “entitlement” must be suitably balanced by a civic sense of “responsible engagement.”
This should happen, of course, through our education system, and the conduct of our political leaders.
But the media too, has a key role to play here.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Many of the newspapers that shaped the discourse for freedom, were vernacular newspapers.
In fact, the then British Government was fearful of the Indian Vernacular Press.
It was to muzzle vernacular newspapers, that the Vernacular Press Act was enacted in 1878.
In our diverse nation, the role of vernacular newspapers – newspapers published in regional languages – remains as important today, as it was then.
They carry content in a language that is easily understood by people.
Very often, they cater to vulnerable and socially disadvantaged groups.
Their strength, their impact, and thus, their responsibility, can never be under-estimated.
They are the messengers of the intent and policies of the Government, in far-flung areas.
Equally, they are the torch-bearers of the thoughts, feelings and emotions of our people.
In this context, it is indeed heartening to note that today, among our vibrant print media, some of the largest selling newspapers, are published in the regional languages.
The Dina Thanthi, is of course, one among them.
On a serious note, we are all aware, that there is just too much that happens in the world everyday.
It is the editors who select and decide what is important.
This, of course, casts upon them, a great responsibility.
Editorial freedom must be used wisely, in public interest.
Equally so, the freedom to write, and to decide what is to be written, does not include the freedom to be “less than accurate,” or “factually incorrect.”
As Mahatma Gandhi himself told us: “The press is called the Fourth Estate.
Even though media may be owned by private individuals, it serves a public purpose.
As scholars say, it is an instrument to produce reform through peace, rather than by force.
Hence, it has as much social accountability as the elected government or the judiciary.
And its conduct must be equally, above board.
Technology has brought about great change in the media.
There was a time, when the headlines of the day, written on a village blackboard, carried immense credibility.
Just as education now focuses a lot more on learning outcomes, our attitude towards consumption of content has changed.
Today, every citizen analyses, discusses, and attempts to cross-check and verify the news that comes to him, through multiple sources.
Media, therefore, must make an extra effort, to maintain credibility.
Healthy competition among credible media platforms is also good for the health of our democracy.
Renewed emphasis on credibility, brings us to the subject of introspection.
I firmly believe that reform in the media, whenever required, can only come from within, through introspection.
Perhaps, it should happen more often.
It is only fair that politics be discussed at length, in a democracy.
However, India is more than just us politicians.
I would be happy to see media focus a lot more, on their stories, and their achievements.
In this endeavour, every citizen with a mobile phone is your ally.
Citizen reporting can be an important tool in the sharing and dissemination of success stories of individuals.
It can also be of immense help in directing relief and rescue efforts in times of crisis, or natural disasters.
Let me also add, that during times of natural disasters, media usually does its best to cover various aspects of the incident.
Natural calamities seem to be occurring with increasing frequency and intensity across the world.
Climate change is a challenge for each one of us.
Can media take a lead in the battle against it?
Can media devote just a little space, or a fixed time daily, to report, discuss, or increase awareness about what we can do to combat climate change?
They have also pointed out the work that remains to be done, before we can claim to have achieved our goal.
There is another key area, where media can play an important role.
This is the initiative of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.
Let me explain this with one example.
Every day, they can write one simple sentence in their language of publication, along with its translation, and trans-literation, in all major Indian languages.
At the end of the year, the readers of the newspaper will have been exposed to 365 such simple sentences, in all major Indian languages.
Imagine the positive impact this simple step can create.
Further, schools can be encouraged to discuss this in their classrooms daily for a few minutes, so that children too, are exposed to the strength and richness of our diversity.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Seventy five years may be a considerable amount of time in a human life-span.
But for a nation, or an institution, it marks just a significant milestone.
About three months ago, we celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement.
In a way, the journey of the Dina Thanthi, has mirrored the rise of India as a young, vibrant nation.
Speaking in Parliament on that day, I gave a call for creating a New India by 2022.
An India that is free from the evils of corruption, casteism, communalism, poverty, illiteracy, and disease.
The next five years must be about Sankalp se Siddhi – accomplishment through resolve.
Only then can we create the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters.
As a newspaper that was born when the nation embraced the Quit India Movement, may I suggest that the Dina Thanthi has a special responsibility in this regard.
I hope that you will use this opportunity, to reflect upon what you can do for your readers, or for the people of India, over the next five years.
And in doing so, continue to maintain the highest standards of professionalism, ethics, and objectivity.
In conclusion, I once again appreciate the efforts of the publishers of Dina Thanthi in the service of the people of Tamil Nadu.
I am sure, they will continue to constructively help in shaping the destiny of our great nation.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation between India and the United States of America on Homeland Security.
My dear citizens
I hope you ended the festive season of Diwali with joy and new hope.
Today, I will be speaking to you about some critical issues and important decisions.
Today I want to make a special request to all of you.
You may recall the economic situation in May 2014 when you entrusted us with an onerous responsibility.
In the context of BRICS, it was being said that the “I” in BRICS was shaky.
Since then, we had two years of severe drought.
Yet, in the last two and a half years with the support of 125 crore Indians, India has become the “bright spot” in the global economy.
It is not just we who are saying this; it is being stated by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
This Government is dedicated to the poor.
It will remain dedicated to them.
In our fight against poverty, our main thrust has been to empower the poor, and make them active participants in the benefits of economic progress.
The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana,
the Jan Suraksha Yojana,
the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana for small enterprises,
the Stand-up India programme for Dalits, Adivasis and Women,
the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Scheme for gas connections in the homes of the poor,
the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana to protect the income of farmers,
the Soil Health Card Scheme to ensure the best possible yield from farmers’ fields,
—these are all reflections of this approach.
In the past decades, the spectre of corruption and black money has grown.
It has weakened the effort to remove poverty.
On the one hand, we are now No. 1 in the rate of economic growth.
But on the other hand, we were ranked close to one hundred in the global corruption perceptions ranking two years back.
In spite of many steps taken, we have only been able to reach a ranking of seventy-six now.
Of course, there is improvement.
This shows the extent to which corruption and black money have spread their tentacles.
The evil of corruption has been spread by certain sections of society for their selfish interest.
They have ignored the poor and cornered benefits.
Some people have misused their office for personal gain.
On the other hand, honest people have fought against this evil.
Crores of common men and women have lived lives of integrity.
We hear about poor auto-rickshaw drivers returning gold ornaments left in the vehicles to their rightful owners.
We hear about taxi drivers who take pains to locate the owners of cell phones left behind.
We hear of vegetable vendors who return excess money given by customers.
There comes a time in the history of a country’s development when a need is felt for a strong and decisive step.
For years, this country has felt that corruption, black money and terrorism are festering sores, holding us back in the race towards development.
Terrorism is a frightening threat.
So many have lost their lives because of it.
But have you ever thought about how these terrorists get their money?
Enemies from across the border run their operations using fake currency notes.
This has been going on for years.
Many times, those using fake five hundred and thousand rupee notes have been caught and many such notes have been seized.
On the one hand is the problem of terrorism; on the other is the challenge posed by corruption and black money.
We began our battle against corruption by setting up an SIT headed by a retired Supreme Court judge, immediately upon taking office.
• a law was passed in 2015 for disclosure of foreign black money;
• agreements with many countries, including the USA, have been made to add provisions for sharing banking information;
• a strict law has come into force from August 2016 to curb benami transactions, which are used to deploy black money earned through corruption;
• a scheme was introduced for declaring black money after paying a stiff penalty;
Through all these efforts, in the last two and a half years, we have brought into the open nearly 1 lakh 25 thousand crore rupees of black money belonging to the corrupt.
Honest citizens want this fight against corruption, black money, benami property, terrorism and counterfeiting to continue.
Inflation becomes worse through the deployment of cash earned in corrupt ways.
The poor have to bear the brunt of this.
It has a direct effect on the purchasing power of the poor and the middle class.
You may yourself have experienced when buying land or a house, that apart from the amount paid by cheque, a large amount is demanded in cash.
This creates problems for an honest person in buying property.
The misuse of cash has led to artificial increase in the cost of goods and services like houses, land, higher education, health care and so on.
Debate on the role of black money in elections has been going on for years.
To break the grip of corruption and black money, we have decided that the five hundred rupee and thousand rupee currency notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight, that is 8th November 2016.
This means that these notes will not be acceptable for transactions from midnight onwards.
The five hundred and thousand rupee notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become just worthless pieces of paper.
The rights and the interests of honest, hard-working people will be fully protected.
Let me assure you that notes of one hundred, fifty, twenty, ten, five, two and one rupee and all coins will remain legal tender and will not be affected.
This step will strengthen the hands of the common man in the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency.
To minimise the difficulties of citizens in the coming days, several steps are being taken.
1. Persons holding old notes of five hundred or one thousand rupees can deposit these notes in their bank or post office accounts from 10th November till close of banking hours on 30th December 2016 without any limit.
3. Your money will remain yours.
You need have no worry on this point.
4. After depositing your money in your account, you can draw it when you need it.
5. Keeping in mind the supply of new notes, in the first few days, there will be a limit of ten thousand rupees per day and twenty thousand rupees per week.
This limit will be increased in the coming days.
6. Apart from depositing your notes in your bank account, another facility will also be there.
7. For your immediate needs, you can go to any bank, head post office or sub post office, show your identity proof like Aadhaar card, voter card, ration card, passport, PAN card or other approved proofs, and exchange your old five hundred or thousand rupee notes for new notes.
8. From 10th November till 24th November the limit for such exchange will be four thousand rupees.
From 25th November till 30th December, the limit will be increased.
9. There may be some who, for some reason, are not able to deposit their old five hundred or thousand rupee notes by 30th December 2016.
10. They can go to specified offices of the Reserve Bank of India up to 31st March 2017 and deposit the notes after submitting a declaration form.
11. On 9th November and in some places on 10th November also, ATMs will not work.
In the first few days, there will be a limit of two thousand rupees per day per card.
12. This will be raised to four thousand rupees later.
13. Five hundred and thousand rupee notes will not be legal tender from midnight.
However for humanitarian reasons, to reduce hardship to citizens, some special arrangements have been made for the first 72 hours, that is till midnight on 11th November.
14. During this period, government hospitals will continue to accept five hundred and thousand rupee notes for payment.
15. This is for the benefit of those families whose members may be unwell.
16. Pharmacies in government hospitals will also accept these notes for buying medicines with doctors’ prescription.
17. For 72 hours, till midnight on 11th November, railway ticket booking counters, ticket counters of government buses and airline ticket counters at airports will accept the old notes for purchase of tickets.
This is for the benefit of those who may be travelling at this time.
18. For 72 hours, five hundred and thousand rupee notes will be accepted also at
• Petrol, diesel and CNG gas stations authorised by public sector oil companies
• Consumer co-operative stores authorised by State or Central Government
• Milk booths authorised by State governments
• Crematoria and burial grounds.
These outlets will have to keep proper records of stock and collections.
19. Arrangements will be made at international airports for arriving and departing passengers who have five hundred or thousand rupee notes of not more than five thousand rupees, to exchange them for new notes or other legal tender.
20. Foreign tourists will be able to exchange foreign currency or old notes of not more than Rs 5000 into legal tender.
In spite of all these efforts there may be temporary hardships to be faced by honest citizens.
Experience tells us that ordinary citizens are always ready to make sacrifices and face difficulties for the benefit of the nation.
I have seen that the ordinary citizen has the determination to do anything, if it will lead to the country’s progress.
So, in this fight against corruption, black money, fake notes and terrorism, in this movement for purifying our country, will our people not put up with difficulties for some days?
I have full confidence that every citizen will stand up and participate in this ‘mahayagna’.
I am sure that all political parties, all governments, social services organizations, the media and indeed all sections of the society will take part in this with enthusiasm and make it a success.
Secrecy was essential for this action.
It is only now, as I speak to you, that various agencies like banks, post offices, railways, hospitals and others are being informed.
The Reserve Bank, banks and post offices have to make many arrangements at very short notice.
Obviously, time will be needed.
Therefore all banks will be closed to the public on 9th November.
This may cause some hardship to you.
I have full faith that banks and post offices will successfully carry out this great task of national importance.
However, I appeal to all of you to help the banks and post offices to meet this challenge with poise and determination.
My dear citizens,
From time to time, based on currency needs, the Reserve Bank with the approval of the Central Government brings out new notes of higher value.
In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a recommendation for issue of five thousand and ten thousand rupee notes.
After careful consideration, this was not accepted.
Now as part of this exercise, RBI’s recommendation to issue two thousand rupee notes has been accepted.
New notes of five hundred rupees and two thousand rupees, with completely new design will be introduced.
Based on past experience, the Reserve Bank will hereafter make arrangements to limit the share of high denomination notes in the total currency in circulation.
In a country’s history, there come moments when every person feels he too should be part of that moment, that he too should make his contribution to the country’s progress.
Such moments come but rarely.
Now, we again have an opportunity where every citizen can join this mahayajna against the ills of corruption, black money and fake notes.
The more help you give in this campaign, the more successful it will be.
It has been a matter of concern for all of us that corruption and black money tend to be accepted as part of life.
This type of thinking has afflicted our politics, our administration and our society like an infestation of termites.
None of our public institutions is free from these termites.
Time and again, I have seen that when the average citizen has to choose between accepting dishonesty and bearing inconvenience, they always choose to put up with inconvenience.
They will not support dishonesty.

Under the policy, a provision has been made for Market development assistance of Rs. 1500 per tonne of city compost for scaling up production and consumption of the product.
Market development assistance would lower MRP of city compost for farmers.
Compost from city garbage would not only provide carbon and primary/secondary nutrients to soil but also help in keeping the city clean.
Eco-Mark standard for City Compost would ensure that environment friendly quality product reaches the farmers.
Composting can reduce the volume of waste to landfill/dumpsite by converting the waste into useful by-products.
This also prevents production of harmful greenhouse gases (especially methane) and toxic material that pollutes groundwater apart from polluting the environment.
City Waste composting would also generate employment in urban areas.
Fertilizer companies and marketing entities will also co-market City Compost with chemical fertilizers through their dealers’ network.
The companies will also adopt villages for promoting the use of compost.
Government Departments and Public Sector undertakings will also use City Compost for their horticulture and related uses.
They will also be authorised to resolve any co-ordination related issue that may arise.
Initially, marketing and promotion of city compost is proposed to be done through the existing fertilizer companies.
In due course, compost manufacturers and other marketing entities recognized by the concerned State Government may also be included for the purpose with the approval of Department of Fertilisers.

The project will be completed in a period of 48 months from the date of the approval by the Government of India.
It consists of a pre-construction phase of 15 months, a construction phase of 30 months and stabilization /commissioning phase of 3 months.

As both the Agreement and the MoU are umbrella pacts, and are non-binding in nature, the Board of Directors of Exim Bank has been authorized to negotiate and conclude any individual contracts and commitments within their framework.
Exim Bank finances, facilitates and promotes India’s international trade.
It provides competitive finance at various stages of the business cycle covering import of technology, export product development, export production and export credit at pre-shipment and post-shipment stages and investments overseas.
Interbank Local Currency Credit Line Agreement
The initial Master Agreement on Extending Credit Facility in Local Currency under the BRICS Interbank Cooperation Mechanism had a validity of five years, which has expired in March 2017.
It is understood that some of the member banks (like CDB and VEB; CDB and BNDES) have entered into bilateral agreements for local currency financing under the Master Agreement signed in 2012.
Although the current conditions are not conducive to usage, it was useful to keep the same alive as an enabling feature in case a suitable opportunity materializes in future.
Exim Bank raises resources in the off-shore market in diverse currencies and swaps to mitigate the risk.
The umbrella Agreement would serve as an enabler to enter into bilateral agreements with member banks subject to national laws, regulations and internal policies of the signatories.
Cooperation Memorandum Relating to Credit Ratings
It would enable sharing of credit ratings amongst the BRICS member banks, based on the request received from another bank.
This would be an ideal mechanism to mitigate the credit risks associated with cross-border financing.
In future, such a mechanism could also serve as pre-cursor to the proposal of having an alternate rating agency by BRICS nations.

In particular, the centre of gravity of global opportunities and challenges are shifting to the Pacific and Indian Ocean Region.
The fortunes of Nations in and around the two oceans are inter-linked.
For this reason, the tides that bear hopes and bring challenges to the shores in India and the Pacific Islands are the same.
That is why some call the region the Indo-Pacific Region.
But that is not all that brings us together.
We also supported the interests of SIDS on capacity building in the latest outcome document on the Post-2015 Development Agenda.
India stands shoulder to shoulder with you for a dedicated seat for SIDS in an expanded and reformed United Nations Security Council in both categories.
India will support the realisation of your vision of Pacific Regionalism.
It is a shining example of cooperative regionalism that should inspire others around the world.
Excellencies, the world may see you as Small Islands with modest populations.
I see you as Large Ocean States with vast potential.
Some of you have Exclusive Economic Zones that are larger than the landmass and Exclusive Economic Zone of India taken together.
Ocean is critical to India’s future, too.
That is why, in the past year, I have focused a lot on ocean economy, both in India and international engagement.
I see huge potential for our cooperation in this area.
India was pleased to stand with you in ensuring that sustainable use of oceans and marine resources constitute a distinct element in the Sustainable Development Goals in the United Nations that were finalised recently.
Our global challenges are similar.
Climate change is an existential threat to the Pacific Islands.
It is also taking a toll on the teaming millions on India’s shoreline of 7500 kilometres and its nearly 1300 islands.
We worked together for a separate goal on climate change in the Sustainable Development Goals, and in a manner that addresses the interests of developing countries.
We must also build closer partnership in pursuit of our shared aims in the WTO-for example on fisheries.
The United Nations is at a historic milestone of its 70th anniversary.
I have written to all member states on charting the course for the United Nations for the years ahead.
We have four times as many Nations.
We have new challenges like climate change.
We have new frontiers like Space and Ocean.
We live in a globalised world with a transformed economy in a digital age.
The United Nations must keep pace with the changing world.
We must press for reform in the United Nations Security Council to ensure its relevance and effectiveness in the 21st century.
We seek your support for the text of the President of the General Assembly as a basis for reforming the Security Council.
Your voice of support for India’s permanent membership of the Security Council will give the United Nations the global character and balance that mirrors our age.
During the last Summit, India announced a number of new initiatives with the Pacific Islands countries.
I am pleased that we have been able to deliver on many of our commitments.
Trade, more than aid, is the enabler for development.
I am pleased to announce the establishment of the FIPIC Trade Office in the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry in New Delhi.
This is just the first step towards promoting trade and investment opportunities between India and Pacific Island countries.
In conclusion, I wish to say that the world is more magnificent for the rich gems of island states.
And, life on these islands is a beautiful proof of God’s will and human spirit.

Modi said since he adored the UAE leaders for their bold vision and ability to understand the forces shaping the modern world, he had no right to give them a “message”.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is arriving in Abu Dhabi today on his historic maiden visit to the UAE, said he is keen to foster a strategic partnership, particularly in the security, energy and investment sectors, with the fastest growing Arab economy and its visionary and pragmatic leadership.
In an interview with Khaleej Times at his high-security official residence at Race Course Road on Indian Independence Day, Modi described the UAE as a ‘Mini-India’ close to his heart where all languages and dialects of his nation are spoken by the 2.6 million Indian diaspora.
Waxing eloquent as he spoke about what the two nations with deep historical links could achieve together, the Indian leader said he wanted to see the UAE as India’s foremost partner in trade and investment as well as in countering terrorism.
Modi was confident that with an overall economic reform programme in progress, Indians in the UAE will find their home country an attractive, stable and secure destination for investment and savings.
Marvelling at the UAE’s spectacular achievements, he described it as a paradise built up in a desert with unmatched vision and remarkable skill.
Following is the interview:
You are the first Indian prime minister in 34 years to visit a country that has 2.6 million Indian residents.
Do you think India unintentionally neglected the UAE in the recent past?
It is an anomaly that an Indian prime minister is visiting the UAE after 34 years.
We have deep historical links and unmatched level of familiarity with each other.
We are located close to each other.
Religion, culture and commerce provide enduring links between us.
We are both multi-cultural and pluralist societies today.
We are now among each other’s top three trading partners.
No country has better air connectivity with India than the UAE.
The 2.6 million Indian nationals here form an indelible human bond between us.
In recent decades, the vision of the UAE leadership has taken this nation to the global forefront.
India has emerged as one of the major global powers and a new frontier of the global economy.
We have a range of common security and strategic concerns in the region, including terrorism and extremism.
So India and UAE have everything to be a top priority for each other.
This is the way I look at the UAE.
The Gulf region is vital for India’s economic, energy and security interests.
I have begun my regional engagement with the UAE.
Where would you like India-UAE relations to be in the next five years?
As I said, I would like to see a truly comprehensive strategic partnership evolve between our two countries.
I want to see the UAE as our foremost trade and investment partner.
We want to work together in advanced areas of science and technology.
We would build regular and effective cooperation in a full range of security challenges.
There are no limits to our relationship.
In short, in every walk of life, we should turn to each other as a matter of habit.
What are your thoughts on this historic trip?
I have always thought, how this paradise could come up in a desert?
What remarkable skill!
Secondly, after becoming prime minister, I have observed that globally, between countries, it is governments which first forge close relationships, and development of people-to-people contacts follows.
I think this was a mismatch.
From a diplomatic viewpoint, this just does not seem right.
This must change.
I certainly have no right to give a “message” to the Government of the UAE.
First of all, this is the first visit by an Indian prime minister after 34 years.
I certainly have no right to give them any kind of message.
But yes, I do wish for our friendship to deepen, and our relationship to broaden, and for India-UAE relations to evolve into a strategic partnership.
As far as the Indian community is concerned, the languages that are spoken in India, are all spoken in the UAE!
In a manner of speaking, the UAE is a “Mini India”.
The Indian community has been embraced with such warmth in the UAE.
The way the two communities work together represents a special bond.
There are tens of thousands of such people there, who are connected with India every moment.
I am sure that the world shall take note of the Indian community’s contribution.
This workforce has been there for the last 30-40 years.
They have set an example for how an expatriate community can become a part of their resident country’s development journey.
You have been to many countries since you became prime minister and met many Indian expatriate communities.
The entire world accepts that the 21st century will be Asia’s.
And the UAE has a special place in Asia.
India is a big country in terms of numbers.
Secondly, earlier, the process of development was a challenge.
Today, the form of development is a challenge in itself.
Moreover, terrorism poses a grave danger to humanity.
Therefore, all those countries who believe in humanity, must stand together without delay.
This is extremely necessary to challenge the forces of terrorism.
As far as the timing of my visit is concerned, this is a question that would be asked of me irrespective of whenever I paid a visit.
I adjust my schedule depending on the time available.
Further, in the UAE, there is the added advantage that one can work on Saturdays and Sundays there.

Bilateral Trade during the year 2006-07 was US$ 2.3 billion.
Trade dynamics changed after the PTA came into force from September 2007.
I am Happy to be here at Kochi the Queen of the Arabian Sea.
The blue sea, the back-waters, the Great Periyar River the greenery all around and its dynamic people make Kochi indeed a Queen among the cities.
It was from here, that the great Indian Sage Adi Shankar embarked on his epic journeys across India to protect the Indian civilization and unify the country.
Today is a historic day when the largest industrial unit of Kerala is entering its next phase of development.
It is indeed a proud moment not just for God’s Own Country but also for the entire Nation.
Bharat Petroleum’s Kochi Refinery has played a critical role in popularizing the clean fuel, LPG among masses in Kerala and neighbouring States for more than 50 years.
I recall, my childhood and youth, when I had seen many mothers struggling with the fire-wood stove in the kitchen.
Ever since, I had always thought of improving their situation and providing healthy kitchens to the mothers and sisters of India.
The Ujjwala scheme of the Government of India is a way to realize this dream.
I am happy that since May 2016, nearly six crore LPG connections have been provided to the poorest of the poor in our country under Ujjawala yojana .
More than twenty three crore LPG consumers have joined the Pahal Scheme.
Pahal has helped in identifying ghost accounts, multiple accounts and inactive accounts.
Pahal has entered into the Guinness book of World records, as the largest Direct Benefit Transfer scheme in the world.
Over one crore customers have given up LPG subsidy under ‘Give it up’ initiative.
By doubling the LPG production with the help of the recent expansion, Kochi Refinery is making a great contribution towards Ujjwala.
To over-come environment pollution, the Government of India is promoting the use of environment friendly transport fuel, that is CNG by expanding the coverage of City Gas Distribution network in the country.
After the successful completion of tenth CGD Bidding Round more than four hundred districts of the country will be connected for providing piped gas supply.
The National Gas Grid or Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga has also been created to have a gas based economy and enhance the share of gas in the energy basket.
The Government has thought of developing additional fifteen thousand Kilo-Miters of gas pipeline network.
To cut down on import of Crude oil, government has taken decisive steps towards reducing imports by ten percent and saving precious foreign exchange.
To this end, the 2nd Generation ethanol through lignocellulose Route has been adopted by Oil PSUs for establishing twelve 2G ethanol plants in 11 States.
The Indian refinery industry has done well in establishing itself as a major player globally.
India, which is second largest oil refiner in Asia, is emerging as a refinery hub with refining more than its demand.
The country’s refinery capacity is currently more than two fourty seven MMTPA.
I take this opportunity to congratulate all for the timely completion of IREP.
Last but not the least I recognize the work of all those labourers who worked day and night during construction.
I am told that at the peak of the project, over twenty thousand labourers were working at the site.
In many ways, they are the ‘Real Heroes’ of the Project.
The Integrated Refinery Expansion Project was also a strategic move of Bharat Petroleum to diversify into non-fuel sector.
petro-chemicals are a grade of chemicals which we don’t speak much about,
but they exist invisibly and touch many aspects of our daily life.
However, most of these chemicals are imported from other countries.
It is our endeavor to see that these petro-chemicals are manufactured in India itself.
I am happy that using the capability of Kochi Refinery to produce propylene after the execution of IREP, BPCL has gone ahead with putting up three world scale plants to manufacture acrylic acid acrylates and oxo alcohol under Make In India.
These niche petro-chemicals will find use in paints, inks, coating, detergent, and in many other articles.
Now, BPCL is starting the construction of a Petro-chemical Complex where it would produce polyols that find end use in foams, fibres, foot-wear, cosmetics, and medicines.
I am sure by all these, many ancillary industries would come to Kochi.
I hope the Petro-chemical Park planned by State Government would become operational soon and leverage the business opportunities provided by the Petro-chemical venture of BPCL.
I am happy to note that BPCL along with other PSUs has set up a Skill Development Institute for skilling and developing employable youth.
I am delighted to lay the foundation stone of the second campus of the institute at Ettumanoor near the holy Mahadeva Temple.
I am also glad to note that Indian Oil Corporation has put out the Mounded Storage Facility at its Cochin Bottling Plant, around 12 kilo-metres from here at a cost of Rupees fifty crores.
It is heartening to note that last August, when Kerala was passing through the worst floods in a hundred years, BPCL Kochi Refinery was kept running against all odds.
I understand that many employees stayed in the refinery to ensure continuous production of petrol, diesel and LPG.
This helped the rescue vehicles and heli-copters to continue relief and rescue operation smoothly.
I urge BPCL Kochi Refinery to keep up this spirit of hard work, social commitment and innovation as it moves towards its next phase of development.
We are proud of Kochi Refinery’s contributions towards Nation Building.
But now we have greater expectations.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will release the IMPRINT India brochure and hand over the first copy to the President of India.
‘IMPRINT India’ is a Pan-IIT and IISc joint initiative to develop a roadmap for research to solve major engineering and technology challenges in ten technology domains relevant to India.

The MoU will establish a framework for bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the area of skill development and will formalise and deepen this partnership.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has congratulated Shri Pankaj Advani on winning his 18th world title in the recently concluded IBSF World Snooker Championship.
“Congratulations Pankaj Advani for winning your 18th world title in the recently concluded IBSF World Snooker Championship.
Your accomplishments make us very proud.”, the Prime Minister said.
The first 10 months of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s term have been eventful.
They’ve been marked by high-profile international diplomacy-visits to India by US President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping, Modi’s own visits to the US and the G20 summit, and his reaching out to SAARC.
At home too, there have been stormy sessions in Parliament, the new government’s first full Budget, and mixed results for his party in state and local body elections.
Expectations from the Modi government have been running high and, in recent weeks, there have been rumblings of discontent, particularly in business and industry, about whether it has been able to deliver on its promise.
In his first interview to the Indian media after he became PM, Modi spoke to Editor-in-Chief Sanjoy Narayan and Executive Editor Shishir Gupta.
Q- Ten months after coming to power, what would you consider your major achievements?
A: Achievements have to be seen with reference to the past.
In what situation did the people bring us to power?
And what is the situation now?
Is there a policy paralysis anymore?
Is there a transparency issue?
Is there stagnancy in governance?
Instead, there is dynamism.
You can see this.
Our vision and commitment is towards the country’s progress, its place in the world and the happiness of its people.
We have taken a series of measures which has restored faith in our capacity to deliver with transparency, efficiency and speed.
We are looking at the interests of the poor of the country and their empowerment.
The direction of our government is reflected in the recent enabling Union Budget, a futuristic railway budget, the pooling of gas for stranded power plants and for fertiliser plants.
These show our firm commitment towards a prosperous and powerful India.
Good governance with good intentions is the hallmark of our government.
Implementation with integrity is our core passion.
We have converted certain adversities born of legacies into opportunities.
The recent conclusion of the auctions in coal and spectrum establishes that the curse of scam and corruption is avoidable and transparency possible if there is political will.
Former prime ministers have been talking about leakage in subsidies.
Our initiative of distribution of LPG subsidy through direct bank transfer is a shining example of our concrete strategy for helping the poor and the marginalised.
For the first time, we have come out with a sound social security umbrella for the weaker sections.
We have restored the global credibility of India in terms of its politics, governance and economy.
This is because the growth of the economy has been restored.
We have left behind countries like China in terms of our GDP growth.
We have left behind the US in terms of steel production.
The current account deficit has come down.
Global institutions like the IMF, OECD and others are predicting even better growth potential in the coming months and years.
India is, thus, back on the global radar.
Hindustan Times front page on May 27, 2014.
The 63-year-old Modi was sworn in by President Pranab Mukherjee 10 days after leading the NDA to a landslide win in the world’s biggest election.
Q- After a month in office, you had said that you were new to Delhi and were struggling to convey your intentions and sincerity to bring a positive change in this country.
Do you still face that challenge?
Have you changed Delhi or has Delhi changed you?
A: When I said this, I meant the central government.
I believe it is changing fast.
Since I had come from a state, I had the sincerity and openness to look at the issues.
I used the perspective of the common man of the country who had voted us to power.
We have worked hard and sat together repeatedly and tried to remove the silos, barriers and bottlenecks.
There is a very large Hindustan beyond Delhi.
Also, now, the central and state governments are working together in the spirit of co-operation rather than as giver and taker.
A true partnership for national development has emerged.
We have succeeded to a large extent in changing the work culture, making it pro-active and professional.
My experience is that Delhi functions in the way defined by its leadership.
I am hopeful of extraordinary outcomes, both towards changing Delhi (the central government) and towards changing the country through Delhi.
I have done a small thing, one that appears small from outside.
I regularly interact with secretaries (bureaucrats) over tea; it is part of my working style… teams are made this way.
I also asked them to go with their families and spend, at least, a night there and tell their children how it all started.
Q- You have empowered the bureaucracy.
You asked them to go to the states and assess for themselves.
Do you think the bureaucracy is delivering?
A: Look, it’s like the pace at which the media operates – a pace that can’t really be kept up with by the authorities.
Let me explain: If there is a ditch on the road, media has to just take a picture or video and put it up.
That takes two minutes, but the person who has to fill it up and do the repairs will, at least, take 24 hours.
By and large, I am satisfied with their performance.
Q- The business community is upset that not much has changed in terms of ease of doing business and with what they see as a spate of tax notices?
Do you think your government has been able to make a difference?
A: First of all, you have to understand that my government is working for the common man.
Our priority is the poor of the country.
We want good governance through a dynamic and seamless government.
Results are visible in all sectors.
Industry has to come forward to take the benefits of the process we have set in motion.
I would request the media to counterpose two things together: The allegations our Congress friends level against us, and the complaints that businessmen have.
The Congress says we are a government of industrialists and industrialists say we do nothing for them!
Our job is to run a policy-driven government.
The government’s job is good governance for everybody.
My job is not to spoon-feed anyone.
The private sector of the country is still stuck with legacy issues of governance – these include tax terrorism, duty inversion and selective exemption.
That is why we tried to address many such issues during the Budget of 2015-16 and to correct them across the board.
Q- This session of Parliament saw severe competition among you and the Congress to look pro-poor.
Your comments?
A. In the 60-year rule of the Congress, the poor of this country have remained poor or have become poorer.
Many countries of the world have surpassed us on all counts, including poverty alleviation.
The Congress did incremental work so as to keep the issue relevant for the next elections.
The coal and spectrum scandals did not benefit the poor.
Nor did the Commonwealth Games fiasco and loot.
Everyone knows who were their beneficiaries.
The result of the Congress’ so-called pro-poor politics and governance of 60 years is that absolute poverty is still our biggest challenge.
One-fourth of the families are without shelter.
Health, education, water, electricity and roads are even bigger unrealised dreams for a large number of citizens of this country.
We rolled out a scheme like Jan Dhan in the first five months.
We opened more than 12 crore bank accounts for financial inclusion.
We took it up in the first four months and are going to complete this task in the next few months.
Don’t the children of the poor study in these public schools?
The so-called pro-poor have been just repeating that there is leakage in subsidy.
We have come out with a comprehensive social security scheme for the poor and marginalised, old and those with low-income levels.
We have set up a skill development ministry to enhance employability of the youth, to whom we are committed to provide jobs through initiatives like Make in India.
In the past, the country had witnessed a jobless and low-growth economy.
Why were these things not done in past 60 years?
Who prevented them?
Moreover, had this been done by the Congress on the eve of elections, it would have been termed pro-poor.
The worry of the Opposition, especially the Congress, is not that we are not pro-poor.
Their worry is that they are being exposed.
We are thankful to the parties for supporting our honest intentions.
These two legislations will prove to be landmarks in the evolution of transparent governance and efficient allocation of key natural resources, which is the need of the hour as the country aspires for quick economic development.
The passing of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill was the next important outcome of this part of the session.
Finally, this important legislation enabling a hike in FDI in the capital-starved insurance sector has been cleared after a long delay of seven years.
The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015 introduced in the Lok Sabha is again a historic initiative for curbing and retrieving black money.
We believe in dialogue with both allies and opposition parties.
I have myself appealed in Parliament that we are ready to discuss and accommodate any issues where political parties have a different view.
I do hope that most of the parties would cooperate on issues of urgent national importance and adopt a bipartisan stance.
Q- You are heading for France, Germany and Canada in the second week of April.
What are your expectations from the visit?
A. I like to combine visits to more than one place when I go on my international tours in order to get more done.
Canada is rich in hydrocarbons and other natural resources.
An Indian Prime Minister would be visiting Canada after a long time.
France and Germany have the manufacturing and skill base which is useful to us.
France is our dependable strategic partner.
In Germany, I am attending the prestigious Hannover Fair where India will be a partner country.
I expect my visit to be helpful in advancing our Make in India initiative.
The free trade agreement discussions are ongoing and would be reflected in my meetings.
Q- You invited the Pakistani Prime Minister to your swearing-in ceremony.
Indo-Pak relations have, however, gone downhill since then.
When should we expect the resumption of bilateral dialogue?
Will there be any pre-conditions?
This remains a guiding factor in our foreign policy.
The dividends are visible in the quantum leap in relations with Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka.
But peace cannot co-exist with terrorism, can it?
Peace can only thrive when the climate is right.
We remain open to bilateral dialogue with Pakistan on all outstanding issues in an environment free from terrorism and violence.
The Shimla Agreement and Lahore Declaration have to be the basis for going forward.
Q- Ahead of your visit to China, there is much expectation and hope about a possible breakthrough in border talks between the two countries.
How realistic are these expectations?
A. The visit of President Xi to India has certainly given the relationship a new level of energy.
I look forward to going to China fairly soon to further build our relationship.
In so far as the border is concerned, the most important point right now is that peace and tranquillity must not be disturbed.
That would create conditions for us to arrive at a mutually-acceptable solution.
Q- Your personal chemistry with US President Barack Obama, as with many other world leaders, has been evident.
Where do you think India figures in the US’ geo-strategic interest in Asia and have you noticed any shift in its approach?
A. This friendship is based on mutual respect and mutual interest.
Events of the recent past have further strengthened my belief, which is also shared by the US President.
We are a rapidly growing economy and can do a lot for each other.
The convergence in our interests is strong and will guide further development of our ties.
Hindustan Times front page on September 29, 2014.
PM Narendra Modi received a rapturous welcome from thousands of Indian-Americans at New York’s Madison Square Garden on his visit to the US.
Q- With unseasonal rains flattening grain and vegetable produce, the price situation is only worsening.
How worried are you?
What are the measures the government is considering to curb prices?
A. When we took charge, prices were already sky-rocketing.
To make matters worse, there was a delay in the monsoon.
Even then, we tried our best and succeeded in bringing down inflation.
While we were witnessing a little relief on this front, the unseasonal rains have given another unfortunate jolt to agriculture.
It is, of course, a matter of great concern to us in the government.
I have also reviewed the situation through video-conference and during my visits in states.
The government will do everything possible for ensuring satisfactory supply of food grains and other edible products.
As of now, the supply side is satisfactory with reference to demand.
However, there is a serious issue of hoarding, exorbitant profits being realised by middle men and speculative behaviour.
State governments have been requested to take stern action against hoarders and black-marketers.
I am very confident that the joint efforts of the states and the Centre shall bear fruit.
Q- You have urged well-off Indians to give up their LPG subsidies to help the government contain mounting expenses.
Are you eventually looking at phasing out LPG subsidies for those who can afford as a matter of policy?
A. It is the responsibility of the government to take care of the poor.
Thus, subsidy is and should be meant for those who really need it.
It should reach the right people, at the right time and in the right proportion.
It is a humanitarian issue and not just an economic issue.
The culture of our country is that of giving; not of cornering something which belongs to others.
Thus, I am appealing to people who are well off.
I re-affirm that the policy of the government is only to reduce leakages by efficient administration of subsidies.
We will use it for meeting energy requirements of the kitchens of the poor, who still use wood fuel and suffer wood-smoke-related health hazards.
Q- Industry in India, as well as globally, has been clamouring for more flexible labour laws in India.
These obviously have social and political implications.
How can India’s labour laws be reformed?
The labour reforms that we are undertaking are fundamentally aimed towards the benefit of the labour force itself.
We have to ensure the welfare and security of the labour force.
Moreover, we all want job creation.
We need work for millions and millions of hands.
We must, therefore, expand the job market.
Thus, our labour reforms have these twin objectives.
With that in mind, we have made a lot of changes which ensure the safety, security and well being of the labour force.
I launched such initiatives as a package called Shramev Jayate.
We have also brought about certain changes in this year’s Budget in the direction of giving flexibility in choosing between EPF or New Pension Scheme and also between ESI and another health insurance scheme.
We are addressing the issues involved in non-payment of EPF amounts to the labour.
We have to use the potential of our talented youth for betterment of our lives and development of the country.
That is why, along with formation of my government we set up a new ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship.
Going further, in the recent Budget, we have launched two schemes dedicated to innovation, incubation and facilitation programmes.
They are the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) and Self-Employment and Talent Utilisation (SETU).
I have already launched a programme for Digital India.
We are also strengthening our IPR regime.
A task force is working on this front.
Q- The BJP’s dream run ended on a disastrous note in the Delhi elections.
Many analysts have interpreted it as the end of the ‘Modi wave’.
How would you respond to it?
A. This is a purely political question.
We respect the verdict of the people of Delhi.
However, I find it amusing to hear that those who did not talk about a ‘Modi wave’ in the context of the outcome of the 2014 general elections are now engaged in intense discussion regarding the ‘Modi wave’.
You have to respect the verdict of the people who have voted during all elections held after the Lok Sabha elections.
Take the cases of the Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Haryana and J&K state elections or the local body elections in Assam, Punjab, MP and Rajasthan.
You said in the Lok Sabha that you were not even consulted about the release of Hurriyat leader Masarat Alam.
Are you happy with the government in Srinagar?
A. These are teething troubles.
We need to have patience.
I myself and my party have made our stand very clear that any lenience towards anti-national elements and terrorists will not be acceptable.
However, we should not forget the larger picture.
The alliance in Jammu and Kashmir is one of the most important developments on the contemporary political scene.
It has the potential to resolve one of our most difficult national problems through people’s participation and good governance.
Q- During your election campaign and thereafter, you said that you want to bring the northeastern region of the country into the national mainstream.
Do you think it is working?
A. Yes, I said this.
I had also said that the eight states of the Northeast are the Ashta Lakshmi for the country as they have huge potential.
This region can contribute a lot in the development of the whole country.
In the last 10 months, I have visited the Northeast twice.
In addition to being with the people of those regions on their important occasions, I have taken up infrastructure projects in various sectors which include water, energy, railways etc.
I am very keen on developing infrastructure and connectivity.
Phase one of gauge conversion of the Lumding-Silchar railway line has been completed in the last eight months.
The trial run is going on.
I have also appealed to the people of the country to accord respect to and ensure the security of the people belonging to the Northeast.
With this purpose, we organised the conference of DGs in the Northeast.
I am confident that with our efforts, the northeastern region of our country will emerge as an active partner in the process of national development.
Q- You recently observed the judiciary should not be influenced by “five-star activists”.
That has created questions in people’s minds.
Do you think the judiciary is stepping in because the executive is leaving a vacuum in many cases?
Kisike irade par shaq nahin karna chahiye (We should not suspect someone’s intentions).
In a major policy drive to give a boost to petroleum and hydrocarbon sector, the Government has unveiled a series of initiatives.
The Union Cabinet and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in its meeting today has taken the following decisions –
2. Marketing and Pricing freedom for new gas production from Deepwater, Ultra Deepwater and High Pressure-High Temperature Areas.
3. Policy for grant of extension to the Production Sharing Contracts for small, medium sized and discovered fields
Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy, HELP: Innovative Policy for future
The present policy regime for exploration and production of oil and gas, known as New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), been in existence for 18 years.
Over the years, various problems and issues have arisen.
Presently, there are separate policies and licenses for different hydrocarbons.
There are separate policy regimes for conventional oil and gas, coal-bed methane, shale oil and gas and gas hydrates.
Different fiscal terms are also in force for allocation of acreages for exploration for different hydrocarbons.
In practice, there is overlapping of resources between different contracts.
Unconventional hydrocarbons (shale gas and shale oil) were unknown when NELP was framed.
This fragmented policy framework leads to inefficiencies in exploiting natural resources.
When a contractor discovers oil or gas, he is expected to share with the Government the profit from his venture, as per the percentage given in his bid.
To prevent loss of Government revenue, these are requirements for Government approval at various stages to prevent the contractor from exaggerating the cost.
Activities cannot be commenced till the approval is given.
This process of approval of activities and cost gives the Government a lot of discretion and has become a major source of delays and disputes.
Many projects have been delayed for months and years due to disagreement between the Government and the contractor regarding the necessity or lack of necessity for particular items of cost, and the correctness of the cost.
Another feature of the current system is that exploration is confined to blocks which have been put on tender by the Government.
There are situations where exploration companies may themselves have information or interest regarding other areas where they may like to pursue exploration.
Currently these opportunities remain untapped, until and unless Government brings them to bidding at some stage.
Currently, the producer price of gas is fixed administratively by the Government.
This has led to loss of revenue, a large number of disputes, arbitrations and court cases.
There is a need for concerted policy measures to stimulate domestic production.
· There will be a uniform licensing system which will cover all hydrocarbons, i.e. oil, gas, coal bed methane etc. under a single license and policy framework.
· Contracts will be based on “biddable revenue sharing”.
Bidders will be required to quote revenue sharein their bids and this will be a key parameter for selecting the winning bid.
They will quote a different share at two levels of revenue called “lower revenue point” and “higher revenue point”.
Revenue share for intermediate points will be calculated by linear interpolation.
This will enable a faster coverage of the available geographical area.
· A concessional royalty regime will be implemented for deep water and ultra-deep water areas.
· In shallow water areas, the royalty rates shall be reduced from 10% to 7.5%.
· The contractor will have freedom for pricing and marketing of gas produced in the domestic market on arms length basis.
To safeguard the Government revenue, the Government’s share of profit will be calculated based on the higher of prevailing international crude price or actual price.
The new policy regime marks a generational shift and modernization of the oil and gas exploration policy.
Marketing and pricing freedom will further simplify the process.
These will remove the discretion in the hands of the Government, reduce disputes, avoid opportunities for corruption, reduce administrative delays and thus stimulate growth.
Marketing and Pricing freedom for new gas production from Deepwater, Ultra Deep water and High Pressure-High Temperature Areas
Imports of hydrocarbons occupy a large share of India’s total imports.
Currently, over three-quarters of the domestic requirement of crude oil and approximately a third of domestic requirement of gas are met through imports.
In terms of macro-economic impact and also in terms of energy security, it is of paramount importance that domestic production of hydrocarbons be increased.
Much of the unexploited oil and gas available in India is in areas characterized by deep water/ultra-deep water or high pressure/high temperature.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved a mechanism for pricing of domestically produced natural gason 18.10.2014.
Recognizing the need for incentivizing gas production from deep water, ultra deep water and High Pressure-High Temperature (HPHT) areas on account of higher costs and higher risks involved in exploitation of gas from such areas, in principle approval was also given for a premium on the gas price for the gas to be produced from new discoveries from such areas.
There are a number of discoveries of gas in deep water/ultra- deep water, high pressure/high temperature areas which have not been developed.
ONGC and other operators have been requesting a higher price for gas to be produced from such fields, without which they may not be economical to bring to production.
Meanwhile, domestic gas production is showing a declining trend.
With the economy growing at over 7%, demand for petroleum products including gas is increasing.
The sector thus faces a situation of rising demand, falling production and consequently rapid increase in imports.
In this background, after extensive consultations, it was felt that rather than fixing a premium, it would be more appropriate to provide marketing and pricing freedom to the gas to be produced from the new discoveries as well as existing discoveries which are yet to commence production.
However, in order to protect user industries from market imperfections, this freedom would be accompanied by a price ceiling based on opportunity cost of imported fuels.
After a careful consideration of the country’s strategic, economic and environmental interests and interests of both producing and consuming industries, a new policy is being introduced which is balanced.
The salient features of the new policy are as follows:
· For all the discoveries in deep water/ultra-deep water/high temperature/ high pressure areas which are yet to commence commercial production as on 1.1.2016 and for all future discoveries in such areas, the producers will be allowed marketing freedom including pricing freedom.
· To protect user industries from any market imperfections, this freedom would be subject to a ceiling price on the basis of landed price of alternative fuels.
To the extent that domestic gas can be produced and sold at a price below import parity price, it will not only benefit the overall economy by boosting employment and GDP and reducing imports, but also benefit the user industry by lowering the average price.
· The ceiling shall be based on publicly available prices of substitute fuels and the method of calculation shall be communicated transparently.
The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas will notify the periodic revision of gas price ceiling under these guidelines.
In the case of existing discoveries which are yet to commence commercial production as on 1.1.2016, if there is pending arbitration or litigation filed by the contractors directly pertaining to gas pricing covering such fields, this policy guideline shall apply only on the conclusion/withdrawal of such litigation/arbitration and the attendant legal proceedings.
All gas fields currently under production will continue to be governed by the pricing regime which is currently applicable to them.
Production Enhancement:
The decision is expected to improve the viability of some of the discoveries already made in such areas and also would lead to monetization of future discoveries as well.
Besides, these there are around 10 discoveries which have been notified and whose potential is yet to be established.
There would be substantial employment generated during the development phase of these discoveries and a part of it would continue during the production phase of the block.
Besides, these there would be around 20000 persons required during the construction phase.
These personnel will take care of fabrication workshops, marine crew in barges, civil works of onshore terminal etc.
Policy for grant of extension to the Production Sharing Contracts for small, medium sized and discovered fields
28 small, medium sized fields discovered by National Oil Companies (ONGC and OIL) were awarded to Private Joint Ventures through Production Sharing Contract (PSC) between 1994-1998 for periods varying from 18 to 25 years.
These Contracts are effective from different points of time.
The earliest of PSCs were signed in the year 1994.
Out of 28 PSCs, two fields in which the duration of the PSC had expired in 2013 had been granted extension up to 2018.
The remaining PSCs would start expiring from 2018.
For many of these fields the recoverable reserves are not likely to be produced within the remaining duration of contract.
It is expected to expedite decision making, enable timely planning by the contractors, and lead to increased oil and gas production.
The following process and guidelines for extension of contracts for small and medium sized discovered fields is being put in place:
(i) The contractor should submit the application for extension of Contract at least 2 years in advance of the expiry date, but not more than 6 years in advance.
The Director General Hydrocarbons (DGH) will make a recommendation within 6 months of submission of application by the contractor.
The Government will take a decision on the request for extension within 3 months of receipt of the proposal from DGH.
(ii) The Government share of Profit Petroleum during the extended period of contract shall be 10% higher than the share as calculated using the normal PSC provisions in any year during the extended period.
For example, if the current profit share, is 10 or 20%, it shall become 20 or 30% respectively.
(iv) The extension of these PSCs would be considered for 10 years both for oil and gas fields or economic life of the Field, whichever is earlier.
The policy for PSC extension will lead to production of hydrocarbons beyond the present term of PSC.
The reserves which are likely to get monetized during the extended period are of the order of 15.7 MMT of oil and 20.6 MMT of Oil Equivalent of gas.
The reserves associated with this field would lead to monetization of reserves worth USD 8.25 Billion (around 53000 Crore).
The monetization of these reserves would require an additional investment of USD 3 to 4 Billion.
Employment Generation Potential:
The extension of these contracts is expected to bring extra investments in the fields and would generate both direct (related to field operations) and indirect employment (related to service industry associated with these fields).
The extension of contracts would also envisage that the present employment levels in these fields are maintained for a longer period of time.
Presently, medium sized fields are employing around 300 personnel for field operations while for small sized fields this would be around 40 to 60 persons.
The investments in these fields may also lead to construction and laying of facilities which would employ several unskilled labourers, over and above the skilled labourers.
Transparency and Minimum Government and Maximum Governance:
With a view to enable the E&P companies to take investment decisions for exploitation of the remaining reserves this extension policy has been approved so as to grant extensions in a fair and transparent manner.
The policy aims at bringing out clear terms of extension so that the resources can be expeditiously exploited in the interest of energy security of the country and improving the investment climate.
Ever since then due to a number of administrative and legal uncertainties, which were raised and examined at various times,the contract was never finalized.
This will enable this long pending and proven oil reserve to come into production, and create new employment.

I am delighted to participate in this function to celebrate the elevation to sainthood of two great saints of Kerala – Saint Kuriakose Elias Chavara and Saint Euphresia.
The whole country is proud of their recognition.
Their elevation was preceded by that of Saint Alphonsa, who also hailed from Kerala.
The life and deeds of Saint Chavara and Saint Euphresia are an inspiration not only to the Christian community, but to humanity as a whole.
They are shining examples of dedication to God through selfless service for the betterment of mankind.
In an era when access to education was limited, he stressed that every church should have a school.
He thus opened the doors of education to people from all sections of society.
Few outside Kerala know that he started a Sanskrit school, and also a printing press.
His contribution towards women’s empowerment was also noteworthy.
Saint Euphrasia was a mystic who dedicated her life to prayer and devotion to God.
Both these saints dedicated their life to God through service of fellow beings.
The ancient Indian saying: “आत्मानो मोक्षार्थम् जगत हितायाचा” – welfare of the world is the way to moksha (salvation) – explains their life.
Spiritualism is rooted in India`s heritage.
Indian saints and Greek sages had intellectual and spiritual exchanges thousands of years back.
India’s openness to new ideas is manifest in the Rig Veda: आनो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः Let noble thoughts come to us from all sides.
This philosophy has guided our intellectual discourse since time immemorial.
Mother India gave birth to many religious and spiritual streams.
Some of them have even travelled beyond Indian borders.
The tradition of welcoming, respecting and honouring all faiths is as old as India itself.
As Swami Vivekananda said: We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true.
This principle of equal respect and treatment for all faiths has been a part of India`s ethos for thousands of years.
And that is how it became integral to the Constitution of India.
Our Constitution did not evolve in a vacuum.
It has roots in the ancient cultural traditions of India.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had inspired us to dream of a land where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.
It is that heaven of freedom we are duty bound to create and preserve.
Let me now come to the issue which is central and critical for peace and harmony in the contemporary world.
The world is increasingly witnessing division and hostility on religious lines.
This has become a matter of global concern.
In this context the ancient Indian plea of mutual respect for all faiths is now beginning to manifest in global discourse.
This long felt need and urge for mutually respectful relations led to the interfaith conference on `Faith in Human Rights` at the Hague on tenth December, 2008.
This was coincidentally also the 60th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations.
Religious leaders representing every major world religion – Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Baha`i Faith, Buddhism, Islam, Taoism and indigenous religions met, discussed and pledged to uphold the Universal Declaration and of freedom of religion or belief.
In their historic declaration, they defined what constitutes freedom of faith and how it is to be safeguarded.
We consider the freedom to have, to retain, and to adopt, a religion or belief, is a personal choice of a citizen.
And now it has been.
This shows that the rest of the world too is evolving along the lines of ancient India.
Speaking for India, and for my government, I declare that my government stands by every word of the above declaration.
My government will ensure that there is complete freedom of faith and that everyone has the undeniable right to retain or adopt the religion of his or her choice without coercion or undue influence.
My government will not allow any religious group, belonging to the majority or the minority, to incite hatred against others, overtly or covertly.
Mine will be a government that gives equal respect to all religions.
My government will act strongly in this regard.
With this commitment, I appeal to all religious groups to act with restraint, mutual respect, and tolerance in the true spirit of this ancient nation which is manifest in our Constitution and is in line with the Hague Declaration.
This will make India proud.
We can achieve this through unity.
Unity strengthens us.
Division weakens us.
I sincerely request all Indians, and all of you present here to support me in this huge task.
You have completed two years as Prime Minister.
What do you consider the biggest gain for the government?
Is there anything that you feel the government could have achieved but has not yet — any regrets?
Inflation was high.
Above all, the common citizen felt helpless.
Today, all of these have disappeared along with the previous government.
There is belief and there is hope.
A strong foundation has been laid for a takeoff.
This transformation from gloom to confidence in the future and from economic decline to sustained growth has the potential to transform India.
As regards regrets, I am not sure if my answer will be to your liking.
Before and during the parliamentary elections, there was a section of the media which strongly hoped that we would not win.
My regret is that in the last two years, I have not been able to convince or persuade that section regarding our point of view.
My challenge is to win over these sceptics, and persuade them of our sincerity and good intentions.
Countries across the world appear to have become more inward-looking; Brexit is one of the signs.
Do you think global trade, including movement of people, will suffer in the near future?
For centuries it has been clear that for each country its own interests are supreme.
Global linkages can be strengthened by harnessing the interests of other countries.
Today, whether it is technology or trade, in movement of human resources or capital and in research and innovation, we live in an interconnected and interdependent world.
And, the nations naturally keep their interests in mind even as they forge bonds of economic cooperation with other countries.
Regarding Brexit, it is a subject that requires in-depth examination.
In this regard, we will take correct decisions keeping in mind our interests.
You have often talked about cooperative federalism.
But there has been criticism that you are not accommodating enough of other parties, and other party-ruled states.
Delhi, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, have complaints against the Union government.
Wouldn’t you like to them along on the path to development?
If you look at the facts, you will find that this government has done more for states, regardless of the party they are ruled by, than any government since Independence.
The recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission led to an increase in the states’ share of central taxes from 32% to 42%.
Despite advice to the contrary from many civil servants, we decided to accept the recommendations.
Initially, some of our critics said the increase would be offset by reduction in centrally sponsored schemes.
The total additional resources transferred to the states, after adjusting for the reduction in centrally sponsored schemes, was nearly Rs 1,44,800 crore.
I am proud of my government’s record in treating opposition-ruled states as full and as equal partners in ‘Team India’.
Let me give you another concrete example.
The sharp reduction in the Centre’s share of taxes made by the Finance Commission necessitated redesign of centrally sponsored schemes.
In fact the Commission had recommended their scrapping.
Since Independence, the structure and funding pattern of centrally sponsored schemes have always been decided by the Centre unilaterally.
No country is an island unto itself today.
We have to work together.
Would you look at the verdict as a referendum on the central government?
Uttar Pradesh has its own importance.
Fifteen years of misrule has resulted in the state declining not just in the field of education, but also in industrial development.
In the ranking of the composite educational development index — U-DISE — Uttar Pradesh was at the bottom among all states and Union territories in 2014-15.
So this means Uttar Pradesh is in bad shape on each of these parameters.
Our strategy will be to take Uttar Pradesh on the path of development.
The Union government has especially approved projects worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore for Uttar Pradesh.
Out of this, Rs 68,000 crore is for roads, and Rs 27,000 crore for railway, power and petroleum projects.
We must pay attention to balanced industrial development in the state.
Eastern Uttar Pradesh cannot be neglected.
It is an area that is economically, educationally, and industrially backward.
To reduce this imbalance, we are investing significantly in the region for the Dedicated Freight Corridor project.
The corridor will also provide a boost to chemical, cement, fertiliser and other industries.
The Union government is also working to restart the fertiliser plant in Gorakhpur at a cost of Rs 6,000 crore.
A new AIIMS is also proposed in eastern Uttar Pradesh.
These steps will transform the industrial and economic landscape of eastern Uttar Pradesh.
You have often expressed your exasperation with the Opposition as far as pushing the legislative agenda of the government is concerned.
Do you really think you can still work out an amicable formula with the Opposition for meeting your targets?
In a democracy, there will always be parties with their own policies, their own strategies and their own priorities.
This is a basic feature of a vibrant democracy.
But along with their priorities and compulsions, all parties also have to keep in mind the larger good and keep the country above party considerations.
I am happy to see that in two years of this Parliament, it has been extremely productive.
These debates took place in a healthy spirit.
In terms of the legislative agenda, most parties have cooperated with the government in the national interest.
In your question, you have lumped together the entire Opposition.
The fact is that barring one party, the Opposition has been constructive in pursuing the larger national interest.

For over half a century, India’s flagship initiative – Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation, ITEC – has offered training and skill development to 161 partner countries from Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Caribbean and Pacific Island states.
From Africa alone, over the last decade, over 25,000 students have trained in India on ITEC scholarships.
At the Third India-Africa Forum Summit in 2015, with participation of all 54 African countries, we decided to double the number of ITEC scholarships to 50,000 over a period of only 5 years.
Our growing engagement with Africa has led to the African Development Bank holding its Annual Meeting outside Africa for the first time, in India earlier this year.
Our development partnerships projects are providing water, electricity, roads, healthcare, tele-medicine, and basic infrastructure to people in dozens of countries across the world.
And, in all of this, our “no strings attached” model of cooperation is driven purely by the requirements and priorities of our partner countries.
The countries present here together represent almost half of the humanity.
Whatever we do, will impact the world substantially.
Yesterday, I had spoken about the BRICS driving the global transformation in the next ten years for it to be a Golden Decade.
1. Creating a Safer World: by organized and coordinated action on at least three issues: Counter Terrorism, Cyber Security and Disaster Management; 2.

I commend President Xi for ably steering the BRICS Chairmanship for the year 2017, and for his warm welcome and hospitality in this beautiful city of Xiamen.
I also welcome President Zuma and commit India’s full support for Johannesburg Summit next year.
I am very fortunate that once again I have got the opportunity to meet you.
His highness crown prince of Abu Dhabhi visited India in 2016.
Today, our relation with the gulf countries is not just confined to a buyer-seller relationship but it has become a partnership.
India takes pride in that more than 3 million Indians living in the gulf countries have become partners in the developmental journey of this region.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the gulf countries, I salute them.
They have provided this kind of good environment to more than 30 lakh Indians as if it is their second home outside India.
And, in a way, we have been able to experience a very good partnership among the human groups in the gulf countries.
In UAE, people were surprised when his highness crown prince took the initiative of constructing a temple in Abu Dhabi when I came here last time.
I would like to express my gratitude to his highness crown prince on behalf of all the 1.25 billion Indians.
But an opportunity will also be there for making the world community feel the mantra which we have followed for living our lives that is: the whole world is one family.
And because of this thing it will also become a medium for acquiring an unique Indian identity.
It will be a compelling responsibility for all those related with the construction of the temple, for all the future devotees that there should not be anything that might hurt the high ideals and principles of humanity even a bit.
I have this expectation from all of you.
Today, the country is scaling new heights of development.
It’s a matter of pride for India that today the country has been given a place of particular respect in a global level summit.
I have been invited to address the summit.
Here, it’s not difficult for you to gather information about India.
You have such knowledge about India that if I talk about one thing then you will talk about ten things.
And in a way a mini India resides here.
There is not even a single corner in this country where India is not represented.
Friends, why should we tax our mind!
From that kind of feeling, the inner feeling today has reached this stage where people ask: Modi Ji please tell when this thing will happen.
The destiny has entrusted India with some responsibilities for the fulfillment of her global role.
Today, the world says that the 21st century belongs to Asia.
We will have to work hard in order to make the 21st century a century of Asia even if there are no immediate gains.
We will have to work hard keeping in view our long term interests.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about Shreya (what must be done) and Priya (what is liked by us).
It should be our effort that we should move ahead by taking steps in the direction of those objectives that must be fulfilled.
There are some people who can immediately understand the step that we take.
If I replace currency then the poor section of the society immediately understands that it’s a solid step in the right direction.
However, the one who spent sleepless nights continues to weep even after two years.
For the last seven years it was being debated whether GST law should be implemented or not.
It’s been done now.
So it’s true that if we move to a new house after living in the earlier house for years we feel very happy during the night that we have constructed a good house, it’s a newly constructed house.
However, when we wake up the next morning we go the left side habitually believing that the bathroom was there and we hit the wall.
We later realise that it’s a new house and the bathroom is on the right side in this house.
Whether everybody has experienced this thing or not?
The country is changing.
I was in Abu Dhabi yesterday and have signed several agreements.
The brighter aspect of the partnership has begun.
I just wanted to say this.
But, I have to be in the next programme so I will not take much of your time.
You have turned up in such large numbers; you have showered so much love.
My eyes do not even reach the other side.
I’m extremely grateful to all of you.
I am finishing this visit in Jet speed.
I’m going to return after visiting five countries within 70-80 hours.
Today evening I am going to have the good luck of meeting the Indian community in very large numbers over there as well.
I need to share some of my thoughts with them as well.
Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
And I assure you that whatever dreams you have, whatever dreams your own people have in India, we are going to realise those dreams together and ahead of time.
I assure you of this thing.
Once again I thank you very much.

India is happy to work together with you for wipingtears from the past and ushering in a bright future.
I understand that the people associated with this service have been trained in India.

So that we know each other better and become even closer friends.

Our milk co-operatives in Gujarat and the Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad, are examples of highly successful and globally acclaimed women-led co-operative movements.
Here at the GES, more than 50 percent of the delegates are women.

They now inspire a new generation of women entrepreneurs.
I hope the deliberations in the summit would focus on how women entrepreneurship can be further supported.

I see that power in India’s young generation today.
I see 800 million potential entrepreneurs who can work towards making the world a better place.

We have succeeded in containing the fiscal and current account deficits, and curbing inflation.
To my entrepreneur friends from across the globe, I would like to say: Come, Make in India, Invest in India – for India, and for the world.
And once again assure you of our whole-hearted support.

I am happy to be here today on the occasion of the golden jubilee week of Auroville.
Sri Aurobindo’s vision of India’s spiritual leadership continues to inspire us, even today.
It is important today to remember the vast extent of action and thought of Shri Aurobindo.
A man of action, a philosopher, a poet, there were so many facets to his character.
And each of them was dedicated to the good of the nation and humanity.
In the words of RabindraNath Tagore:
Rabindranath, O Aurobindo, bows to thee!
As The Mother had observed, Auroville was to be a universal town.
The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity.
The large gathering here today, is a reflection of that idea.
For ages, India has been a spiritual destination for the world.
The great universities of Nalanda and Taxila hosted students from all over the world.
Many of the world’s great religions were born here.
They motivate people from all walks of life,) to take to a spiritual path in their day to day dealings.
Recently, the United Nations has declared June 21 as International Day of Yoga, recognizing a great Indian tradition.
Auroville has brought together men and women, young and old, cutting across boundaries and identities.
I understand that Auroville’s Charter was hand-written in French by the Divine Mother herself.
According to the Charter, the Mother set five high principles for Auroville.
The first high principle of Auroville is that it belongs to all humanity.
This is a reflection of our ancient credo of VasudhaivaKutumbakam — the world is one family.
I am told, that the inauguration ceremony of Auroville in 1968 was attended by delegates of 124 nations.
I learn that today, it has over two thousand, four hundred residents from forty-nine countries.
This leads us to the second high principle of Auroville.
Anyone who is willingly in service of the Divine Consciousness is entitled to live in Auroville.
The third founding principle of Auroville is that it will emerge as the bridge between the past and the future.
If one looks at where the world and India were in 1968 when Auroville was founded, the world was living in compartments and in a state of cold war.
The idea of Auroville saw the world getting integrated by trade, travel and communication.
Auroville was conceived with the vision of enveloping the whole of humanity in one small area.
This would show that the future would see an integrated world.
The fourth founding principle of Auroville is that it will connect the spiritual and material approaches of the contemporary world.
As the world progresses materially through science and technology, it will increasingly long for and need spiritual orientation for social order and stability.
At Auroville, the material and the spiritual, co-exist in harmony.
The fifth basic principle of Auroville is that it will be a place of un-ending learning and constant progress, so that it never stagnates.
Indian society is fundamentally diverse.
It has fostered dialogue and a philosophic tradition.
Auroville show-cases this ancient Indian tradition to the world by bringing together global diversity.
India is home to the age old tradition of Gurukul, where learning is not confined to classrooms; where life is a living laboratory.
Auroville too has developed as a place of un-ending and life-long education.
In ancient times, our sages and ‘Rishis’ would perform ‘yagya’ to begin great endeavours.
Occasionally, those yagyas would shape the course of history.
One such ‘Yagna’ for unity was performed here exactly 50 years ago.
Men and Women brought soils from all parts of the world.
In the mixing of the soils, began the journey of one-ness.
The world has received positive vibrations from Auroville, in many forms, over the years.
Be it un-ending education, environment regeneration, renewable energy, organic agriculture, appropriate building technologies, water management, or waste management.
Auroville has been a pioneer.
You have done a lot to promote quality education in the country.
On the occasion of 50 years of Auroville, I hope you can enhance your efforts in this direction.
Serving young minds through education will be a big tribute to Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.
He was also my Education Advisor, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
He is not amongst us today.
But his contribution to the field of education in India, is worth remembering.
May Auroville continue to come up with ideas to empower the ordinary citizens of this country.
May people from far and wide bring with them new ideas.
May Auroville become the centre where these ideas are synthesized.
May Auroville serve as a beacon to the world.
May it be the guardian which calls for breaking down narrow walls of the mind.
May it continue to invite everyone to celebrate the possibilities of humanity’s one-ness.
May the spirit of Maharishi Aurobindo and the Divine Mother, continue to guide Auroville to the eventual fulfilment of its lofty founding vision.

It is a great pleasure to visit Republic of Korea.
I sincerely thank President Park for the warm welcome and hospitality.
I had excellent discussions with President Park today.
Her own visit to India in January 2014 had a big impact on our relations.
I am pleased to visit Republic of Korea in the first year of my Government.
I have visited here before as Chief Minister.
Korea’s economic rise had left me deeply impressed.
In the short time since then, Korea’s global leadership in manufacturing and technology has become more visible.
Korea is also a strong pillar of democracy in Asia.
Korea’s rapid progress has made the vision of an Asian century stronger.
It will be based not only on the strength of Korea’s economy, but also its contribution to peace and stability in the region.
We consider Korea a crucial partner in India’s economic modernization.
I am here at a time of renewed momentum in the Indian economy.
We are pursuing a comprehensive programme of economic modernization that covers all sectors of our economy and all aspects of policies and procedures.
We have a special focus on infrastructure and developing a world class manufacturing sector.
Korea can be a leading partner in this enterprise.
For all these reasons, this is a very important visit for me.
I am pleased that we have agreed to upgrade the bilateral relationship to ‘Special Strategic Partnership’.
The decisions today reflect how seriously we take the new framework of our relationship.
Republic of Korea is the second country with which India will have a diplomatic and security dialogue in 2+2 format.
I welcome the decision to have regular cooperation between our national security councils.
We have also agreed to expand cooperation between our armed forces.
We intend to deepen our cooperation in defence technology and manufacture of defence equipment in India.
This sector offers huge opportunities in India.
I have requested President Park to support the participation of Korean companies in the defence sector in India.
Her response has been positive.
We had extensive discussions on our economic relations.
Many Korean brands are household names in India.
President Park and I see vast opportunities for Korean companies to participate in our ‘Make in India’ Mission.
I will meet Korea’s business leaders tomorrow.
Korean companies have the edge to succeed in India.
We will also establish a channel – Korea Plus – to facilitate their investment and operations in India.
I sought President Park’s support for participation of Korean companies in new areas.
Besides defence equipment, I invited Korean investments in areas like ship building, including LNG tankers.

Section 7 of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 will accordingly be amended to define units producing goods and rendering services in terms of annual turnover as follows:
• A micro enterprise will be defined as a unit where the annual turnover does not exceed five crore rupees;
• A small enterprise will be defined as a unit where the annual turnover is more than five crore rupees but does not exceed Rs 75 crore;

Ports in India are generally named after the city or town in which these are situated.
However, the Government, in special cases, after due consideration, have renamed the Ports after great leaders in the past.
By renaming Kandla Port as “Deendayal Port, Kandla”, a grateful nation would be remembering the invaluable contributions made by one of the greatest sons of India, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
This will inspire the People of Gujarat, particularly the Youth, who may not be fully aware of the contributions made by the great leader.
There have been public demands from various quarters in Gujarat, especially from Kachhh district, to rename ‘Kandla Port’ as ‘Deendayal Port, Kandla’.
He devoted his entire life serving the nation and worked among the masses and dedicated and sacrificed his life for the upliftment of the Poor & Working Class at the same time.
Upholding the values of democracy founded on tolerance, discipline, selflessness and respect for the law of the land, all his actions were based on the principles of ‘Integral Humanism’.
Throughout his life, he worked tirelessly for Indianisation of democracy, honouring the public opinion, selflessness and respect for law of the land.
Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay dedicated his entire life for public service and was the epitome of simplicity, honesty and selfless service for the poor and down-trodden.

This reform will promote Make in India, help exports and thus boost employment while providing enhanced revenue.
Together we will take India to new heights of progress”, the Prime Minister tweeted.
Your Excellency Mr. David Cameron!
Hon. Mr. Alan Yarrow, the Lord Mayor of London!
Ladies and Gentlemen!
It is a great pleasure for me to be with you this evening.
I must confess that there has been a delay in my coming to this great country.
But, the good news is that myself and His Excellency Cameron have been in constant touch.
We have been meeting frequently at various places and exchanging views.
UK and India have known each other very well since several centuries.
Our system of Governance is also based largely on the Westminster model.
• Our institutions know to interact with each other;
• Our people know to work with each other;
• Our businesses know to grow with each other.
That is the reason that UK is among India’s major trading partners.
UK is also the third largest foreign investor in India.
We have to effectively leverage the mutual understanding which is there for each other.
We are particularly keen to develop the sectors where UK is strong.
We are working hard to create conducive conditions for this engagement.
A strong Indian community here keeps pushing us for better and better integration with UK.
Since my Government took over, we have been working relentlessly to put the economy on track.
Particularly, we have worked very aggressively to make India an easy and simple place to do business.
We believe that this is necessary for improving the lives of ordinary citizens in India.
The results of our hard work are now visible.
IMF Chief has recently said that India is among few bright spots in global economy today.
Our growth rate in the last year was 7.3%.
No other country has made such a big improvement.
We are also committed to take these corrections at the State, district and city level.
States are moving hand-in-hand with the federal government in this task in the spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism.
Recently, we did a ranking of our state governments on ease of doing business with the help of the World Bank Group.
This has prompted the state governments into a healthy competition among themselves to ensure a business friendly eco-system.
This was for the first time that the World Bank involved itself in a sub-national exercise on ease of doing business.
One of the biggest challenges in India today is to productively employ the youth.
For meeting this challenge, we need to provide a huge push to manufacturing which has stagnated at around 16% of the GDP for several decades.
This share must reach around 25% in the short and medium term.
With this in view, we have launched the “Make in India” initiative.
We are working on all fronts to make India a global manufacturing hub.
To achieve this objective, apart from vigorous exercise for ease of doing business, we have fast tracked approvals and clearances for industry and infrastructure.
The hall mark of our strategy now is Policy driven Governance.
Measures like transparent auction and allocation of key natural resources like coal, spectrum, iron ore have created a level playing field for investors.
To enhance the flow of foreign investments, we have liberalized the FDI regime allowing 100% FDI in railways.
We enhanced the FDI limits to 49% in Defence and Insurance.
We are also conscious of the last mile operational issues in such policies.
In that spirit, early this week, we have carried out substantial changes in the FDI regime across 15 sectors.
To give an example: now there are just no restrictions in the FDI Policy for construction sector.
Similarly, very radical liberalization has been done in sectors like plantation, e-commerce and single brand retail.
Moreover, we have now brought most of the FDI proposals under the automatic route.
With this round of reforms, I can say that India is among the most open countries for Foreign Investments.
Infrastructure is another big challenge for India.
We are keen to build futuristic physical and social infrastructure.
Through self-imposed discipline in financial management, we have been able to allocate more resources for infrastructure sectors.
In addition, we are setting up an India Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
We have targeted an annual contribution of 3.5 billion US Dollars into this fund from our own resources.
We are putting in place a professional team for asset management.
We have also come up with the mechanism of Tax Free Infrastructure Bonds for projects in rail, road and other sectors.
We will work together with the British Government, Industry and the financial markets to deepen our relationship and harness their interest in India’s infrastructure.
Very soon, these bonds will become strong instruments for engagement between our financial markets.
There were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on the sentiments of foreign investors.
We have taken very decisive steps to remove a number of long pending concerns.
To give you some examples:-
• We have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance;
• We have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years previously;
• We have taken almost 60% of the defence items out of the licensing process and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate for the exports.
• We have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation and demonstrated this position in a number of ways.
We are keen to learn from your experience in structuring and implementing PPP projects.
A comprehensive National IPR policy is being finalized.
We want your active involvement in translating our dreams into reality.
Our commitment and aggressiveness to achieve the goal in a faster and effective manner offers immense opportunities to British Companies.
These opportunities range from building 50 million houses to setting up 100 smart cities; modernization of railway network and re-development of stations to new railway corridors; generation of 175 GW of renewable energy to transmission and distribution networks, from National Highways and bridges, to Metro rail networks.
Such a huge potential for creation of infrastructure and production of goods will not be available in any other country.
More importantly, no one place on the earth can offer the potential for usage and consumption on such a massive scale.
We are trying to harness this potential through our policies and people.
The campaigns like Digital India and Skill India are designed to prepare the people to take part in this process.
To tap their energy fully, we have also launched the Start up India Campaign.
We have witnessed massive growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past.
Some of these have already begun to challenge established global players.
India is on the threshold of a big IT revolution.
We are encouraging it to fast-track the services to our 1.25 billion people.
New Technology and renewable energy is our new Mantra.
Whatever we do, we will do in a cleaner and greener way.
Energy efficiency, water recycling, waste to energy, clean India and river cleaning are among those initiatives.
These initiatives provide additional avenues for investment in modern technology and human resources.
Ours is a country of the vibrant youth and a rising middle class.
There is a huge domestic market in India.
I have been saying that the three Ds of Democracy, Demography and Demand is our basic strength.
Moreover, talented young minds in India have now begun taking risks.
They are preferring to become Entrepreneurs.
Thus, we have moved forward from D to E which is Entrepreneurship.
Necessary conditions for take-off of the Indian economy have been created.
Never before, India was so well prepared to absorb talent, technology and investment from outside.
I can assure you that it will get better and better in the coming days.
We will be open to welcome your ideas, innovations and enterprises.
We are open to carry out necessary corrections in our policies and procedures.
Given the visionary and dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Cameron and his interest in India, I am personally eager to work with the British Government and companies.
With these words, I welcome you to India.
• At this point of time, it is wiser to be in India;
• Further, we are making it easier to invest in India;
• Believe me, we are making it even better to ‘Make in India’.

1. Create self-sufficiency in steel production by providing policy support & guidance to private manufacturers, MSME steel producers, CPSEs 2.
Some highlights of New Steel Policy
• The Policy seeks to increase consumption of steel and major segments are infrastructure, automobiles and housing.
• Potential of MSME steel sector has been recognised.
The initiative is aimed to spearhead R&D of national importance in iron & steel sector utilizing tripartite synergy amongst industry, national R&D laboratories and academic institutes.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today attended a Samajik Adhikarita Shivir for distribution of aids and assistive devices in Varanasi.
The distributed material included sewing machines, Braille kits, hearing aids, smart canes, and other smart devices.
The beneficiaries included differently abled persons and widows.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Narendra Modi recalled his speech even before taking oath of office as Prime Minister, where he had mentioned that his Government would be devoted to the service of the poor and downtrodden.
He said the Union Government has taken a series of steps in this direction.
He said this camp in Varanasi is just one of about 1800 such camps that have been held across the country since his Government came to power.
This number, he asserted, was far greater than the comparable number in the case of previous governments.
He said these camps had eliminated middlemen from the activity of distribution of aids and assistive devices.
The Prime Minister said that he has been the target of personal attacks, because middlemen are being eliminated and governance is being tightened.
He said these personal attacks will not deter him from his path, which is the service of the poor and weaker sections of society.
The Prime Minister spoke at length about replacing the word “viklang” with “divyang” in everyday usage, to describe differently-abled people.
He said the focus should not be on disabilities, but on the extra-ordinary abilities that differently abled people are blessed with.
The Prime Minister spoke of his Government’s Sugamya Bharat campaign to provide easy accessibility to differently-abled people.
He complimented the Railways for the launch of the Mahamana Express with modern passenger amenities, which he flagged-off on the occasion.
The Prime Minister spoke about the bus accident involving some people who were coming to attend this event.
He said Ministers and officers had rushed to the hospital, and the injured would be well taken care of.
Under the new policy, 69 oil fields which have been held by ONGC and OIL for many years, but have not been exploited, will be opened for competitive bidding.
Under this policy, exploration companies will be able to submit bids for exploiting these oil fields.
These oil fields have not been developed earlier as they were considered as marginal fields, and hence were of lower priority.
With appropriate changes in policy, it is expected that these fields can be brought into production.
In keeping with the principle of `Minimum Government Maximum Governance’, significant changes have been made in the design of the proposed contracts.
The earlier contracts were based on the concept of profit sharing.
The new policy for these marginal fields also allows the successful bidder to sell at the prevailing market price of gas, rather than at administered price.
In a series of Facebook posts from his account, the Prime Minister said:
“I will be visiting Israel on 4-6 July, 2017 upon invitation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
As the first Indian Prime Minister to do so, I am greatly looking forward to this unprecedented visit that will bring our two countries and people closer.
I will have in-depth talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu on the full spectrum of our partnership and strengthening it in diverse fields for mutual benefit.
I will meet President Reuven Ruvi Rivlin – who I had the pleasure of receiving in New Delhi in November last year, as well as other senior leaders.
I am particularly looking forward to interacting with the large vibrant Indian diaspora in Israel that represents an enduring link between our two peoples.
On the economic side, I will join with leading Indian and Israeli CEOs and start-ups to discuss our shared priority of expanding business and investment collaboration on the ground.
In addition, I hope to get insights into Israel’s accomplishments in technology and innovation through on-site visits.
During my stay, I will visit the Yad Vashem Memorial Museum to honour the memory of the victims of the holocaust that counts among the greatest tragedies in human history.
Later, I will also pay my respects to the courageous Indian soldiers who laid down their lives during the liberation of Haifa in 1918.
On the evening of 6 July, I will commence my visit to Hamburg for the 12th G-20 Summit hosted by Germany.
Over two days on 7th and 8th July, I look forward to engaging leaders from other G-20 countries on the vital issues affecting our world today that have a bearing on economic growth, sustainable development, and peace and stability.
We will review progress on decisions since the Hangzhou Summit last year and deliberate on issues of terrorism, climate, sustainable development, growth and trade, digitalisation, health, employment, migration, women’s empowerment, and partnership with Africa.
The theme chosen for this year is “Shaping an Inter-connected World”.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for:-
(i). Formally requesting the Council of Europe for India’s accession to the Council of Europe Convention on the transfer of Sentenced Persons through a letter; and
(ii). upon receiving the formal invitation from the Council of Europe to become a party to the Convention, to accede to the Convention on Transfer of Sentenced Persons.
Acceding to a multilateral convention of the Council of Europe on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, to which 64 States are Parties, would obviate the need to enter into bilateral arrangements with each one of them.
Accession to the Convention will help Indian Prisoners imprisoned in the Council of Europe Countries or vice-versa, to be near their families for serving the remaining part of their sentence.
This would facilitate the process of their social rehabilitation.
So far, a total of 64 countries have ratified the convention.
Hence the Repatriation of Prisoners Act, 2003 was enacted for achieving the above purpose.
For achieving the objectives of the Act, a Treaty/Agreement is required to be signed with countries having mutual interest with us on this matter.
So far, we have signed bilateral Agreements with 27 countries and we have also acceded to one multilateral treaty that is the Inter-American Convention on Swerving Criminal sentences Abroad (IAC) – which is signed by Member States of the Organisation of American States (OAS) but is also open to accession by non-OAS countries.

Over the last three years, the media has added great strength to ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ and effectively furthered the message of cleanliness.
In this day and age we are seeing the rise of social media and news being consumed through mobile phones.

It is trust and optimism that will take our nation forward.
We face the challenges and work to fulfil people’s aspirations.
Our friends in the Congress see things in two time periods.
BC- Before Congress, when nothing happened.
AD- After dynasty- where everything happened.
In all spheres, investment, steel sector, start ups, milk and agriculture, aviation, India’s progress is outstanding.
In hating Modi, the Opposition has begun to hate the nation.
That is why their leaders go to London and do press conferences to show India in bad light.
In their 55 years, sanitation coverage was around 38% and in our 55 months it is nearly 98%.
Gas connections in their 55 years was 12 crore, it is 13 crore in 55 months.
We have worked at greater speed in our five years.
Think about it, Congress imposed Emergency, but Modi is destroying institutions.
Congress insults Army, calls the Army Chief a Gunda but Modi is destroying institutions.
Congress leaders create stories that Indian Army is doing a coup…but Modi is destroying institutions.
Congress questions the EC and EVM but Modi is destroying institutions.
Congress bullies the judiciary but Modi is destroying institutions.
Congress calls Planning Commission a bunch of jokers…but Modi is destroying institutions.
The phone banking of the UPA did wonders for the friends of their leaders.
Due to such favouritism, our banking system witnessed many problems.
I want to say it on the floor of the Parliament that the Indian National Congress does not want our armed forces to be strong.
They do not want our security apparatus to be strong.
He had said that joining Congress is like committing suicide.
Thousands of organisations were getting funds from overseas.
We sought transparency in the process but these organisations shut down.
Why was such money allowed to come in without accountability?
Price rise and Congress are a team.
When Congress comes, so does rising prices.
The NDA Government has worked to keep prices under check.
What was the reason LED bulbs were so costly during the UPA era.
Our Government has worked towards the good health and wellbeing of the people of India.
Prices of stents, knee surgeries and medicines are coming down.
India will be friends with both Saudi Arabia and Iran.
I assure you, those who have looted the nation will continue to be scared of Narendra Modi.

I am deeply honoured by the invitation to address this august House.
I have had similar privilege in other Parliaments.
This is, however, special.
This honour has come to a Prime Minister of India for the first time.
It is a great honour for the 1.25 billion people of India.
I carry their greetings and warm wishes of friendship with me to this House and for all the people of Uganda.
Your presence, Madam Speaker, reminds me of my Lok Sabha, which also has a lady Speaker.
I also see a large number of young Members of Parliament here.
This is good news for democracy.
I am conscious of the history that brings us to this point, when the Prime Minister of the largest democracy is speaking to elected Members of the Parliament of another sovereign nation.
Over a century ago, the heroic labour connected Uganda to the shores of the Indian Ocean through railway.
Your gracious presence today speaks of the precious bonds of friendship and solidarity between our people.
You have brought peace and stability to your nation and to the region.
You have put it on the path of growth and progress amidst many challenges.
You have empowered women and made your nation more inclusive.
Your visionary leadership has enabled Ugandan people of Indian origin to return to their cherished home, regain their lives and help rebuild the nation that they deeply love.
In opening the State House to the celebration of Deepawali, you have lit up the many strands of ties that connect India and Uganda.
Among these, the most sacred is the site at Jinja, at the source of River Nile, where a portion of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed.
In his life and beyond, he is one with Africa and Africans.
And, at the sacred site in Jinja, where a statue of Gandhiji now stands, we will build a Gandhi Heritage Centre.
As we approach the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, there can be no better homage than a Centre to remind us of Africa’s role in shaping his mission that even inspired Africa to freedom and justice; and the universal and timeless values of his life and message.
The story of India’s own freedom struggle is closely linked to Africa.
Nowhere did it apply more than in Africa.
Twenty years before our independence, the leaders of our National Movement had linked India’s freedom struggle to the fight against colonial rule around the world, especially Africa.
Even as India stood on the threshold of independence, the fate of Africa was not far from our minds.
Free India did not forget his words.
India pursued Afro-Asian solidarity in Bandung.
India’s principled support to Africa’s liberation movements often came at a cost to our nation’s trade.
But, nothing mattered in comparison to Africa’s freedom.
Let us fight for mutual prosperity together.”
We in India rejoice in every African success, because of our deep bonds of friendships.
India is proud to be Africa’s partner.
And, Uganda is central to our commitment to the continent.
The first, of 141 million US dollars for electricity lines.
And the second, of 64 million US dollars for agriculture and dairy production.
As in the past, we will continue to support the aspirations of the people of Uganda – in agriculture and healthcare, education and training, infrastructure and energy, capacity building in government and training in defence.
Other than all these, 32 Heads of State or Government from Africa have visited India in the last four years.
My home state Gujarat was proud to be the host of the first ever meeting of the African Development Bank in India last year.
And we are also opening 18 new embassies in Africa.
Our development partnership currently includes implementation of 180 Lines of Credit worth about USD 11 billion in over 40 African countries.
At the last India Africa Forum Summit, we had committed a concessional Line of Credit of 10 billion U.S. dollars and 600 million dollars in grant assistance.
Indian companies have invested over US$ 54 billion in Africa.
Our trade with Africa is now over US$ 62 billion.
This is over 21 per cent more than in the previous year.
Africa’s exports to India are growing.
And, our economic ties are now increasingly driven by new partnerships of innovation in the digital economy.
The Pan Africa E-Network links 48 African countries to India, and to one another.
It can become the new backbone for digital innovation in Africa.
With several coastal nations, our partnership now increasingly seeks to harness the benefits of Blue Economy in a sustainable manner.
And, India’s medicines turned the tide on diseases that were once a threat to Africa’s future.
They also continue to make healthcare affordable and accessible to many.
As we work together for prosperity, we have stood together for peace.
We are proud of the work of Indian peacekeepers in over a dozen UN peacekeeping missions in Africa, since our first mission in Congo in 1960.
In all the UN peacekeeping Missions in the world, 163 Indians have made the supreme sacrifice.
Our defence and security cooperation is growing with nations in Africa, as we work together to counter terrorism and piracy, and keep our seas secure.
India’s engagement with Africa will continue to be guided by 10 principles.
One, Africa will be at the top of our priorities.
We will continue to intensify and deepen our engagement with Africa.
As we have shown, it will be sustained and regular.
Two, our development partnership will be guided by your priorities.
It will be on terms that will be comfortable for you, that will liberate your potential and not constrain your future.
We will rely on African talent and skills.
We will build as much local capacity and create as many local opportunities as possible.
Five, Africa has 60 per cent of the world’s arable land, but produces just 10 per cent of the global output.
We will work with you to improve Africa’s agriculture.
Six, our partnership will address the challenges of climate change.
We will work with Africa to ensure a just international climate order; to preserve our biodiversity; and, adopt clean and efficient energy sources.
Seven, we will strengthen our cooperation and mutual capabilities in combating terrorism and extremism; keeping our cyberspace safe and secure; and, supporting the UN in advancing and keeping peace;.
Eight, we will work with African nations to keep the oceans open and free for the benefit of all nations.
The world needs cooperation and not competition in the eastern shores of Africa and the eastern Indian Ocean.
That is why India’s vision of Indian Ocean Security is cooperative and inclusive, rooted in security and growth for all in the region.
That will be a key purpose of our foreign policy.
India will work with you and for you.
Our partnership will build instruments of empowerment in Africa.
We will stand in solidarity with your endeavours, in transparency, with respect and on the principle of equality.
We will speak for you, and with you.
Two-thirds of India and two-thirds of Africa is under the age of 35 years.
And, if the future belongs to the youth, then this century is ours to shape and build.
And, let us be guided by the Ugandan saying that is – “Anayejitahidi hufaidi” which means “one who makes the extra effort will benefit”.

Your Excellency, Taoiseach Enda Kenny,
It is truly a pleasure to be here in Ireland.
Short this visit may be, it is historic.
It has taken 59 years for an Indian Prime Minister to visit Ireland.
Thank you for your very warm reception and gracious hospitality.
Thank you for your kind words of friendship for India.
India and Ireland share much in common.
We can compare notes on our shared colonial history.
Our Constitutions have something sacred in common.
The Directive Principles of State Policy in the Indian Constitution are inspired by the Irish Constitution.
Irish experts gave us institutions like the Geological Survey of India and the first Linguistic Survey of India.
Today, sports manufacturers in India keep Ireland’s passion for rugby going.
In the pain of their unfading memory, we are also reminded of all that binds us today – our values and our aspirations and the challenges that we all face today.
India and Ireland must seek closer partnership and cooperation.
India and Ireland are among the fastest growing economies of Asia and Europe.
We are pleased that our bilateral trade and investment ties are growing, despite global and regional uncertainties.
Our economic partnership can have a strong technology focus – information technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, agriculture and clean energy.
Greater sensitivity of the European Union to India’s commercial interests and challenges will help us resume discussions on India-EU Broad-based Trade and Investment Agreement.
India and Ireland are ideally placed to form productive partnerships to take advantage of the opportunities in the digital age.
I hope that our Joint Working Group on Information Technology will meet soon to chart out the roadmap for collaboration.
I also hope that Ireland’s visa policy will be sensitive to the requirements of India’s Information Technology firms.
I am glad that we will soon have direct air services by airlines of both countries.
Ireland’s Science Centre in Karnataka is one example of that cooperation.
I was pleased to exchange views on a broad range of international challenges, including terrorism, radicalization and the situation in Europe and Asia.
Our discussions underlined the importance of closer cooperation between countries like India and Ireland, which share democratic values and are consistent advocates of international peace and stability.
In this context, we discussed the role of the United Nations and its Security Council in meeting these challenges in the 21st century.
India and Ireland have been partners in peacekeeping operations.
I thank Ireland for its leadership in sustainable development goals.
I sought Ireland’s support for the reforms of the UN Security Council within a fixed time frame – in particular, for successful conclusion of inter-governmental negotiations in the 70th year of the United Nations.
I also sought his support for India’s permanent membership of the reformed Security Council.
India and Ireland are peace-loving countries.
We have both been at the forefront on non-proliferation.
We respect Ireland’s strong and principled position on this issue.
India has also been a leading voice on universal nuclear disarmament since Independence.
We remain strongly committed to that goal.
Our credentials and record on non-proliferation are second to none.
Ireland’s support was crucial for India-specific exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2008.
With rapid growth in India’s enormous energy demand, it has opened a big option to pursue a sustainable development path.
India was the first country with which you established diplomatic relations in Asia.
We can now be your anchor in Asia.
Similarly, for India, I see Ireland as a vital gateway to Europe and a bridge across the Atlantic.
Thank you once again for your hospitality.
It has been a couple of decades since you last visited India.
I look forward to seeing you in India.

This was the period when, in the Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, and the mill-workers’ strike in Ahmedabad, the deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi’s thoughts and practices was amply and clearly visible.
The country didn’t know of him, he bore no influence then; it was just the beginning.
Mahatma Gandhi, through his demeanour and deeds, could inspire the poorest of the poor, the most illiterate, to unite and come together out into the open for the struggle against the British Rule; this was a manifestation of an incredible inner strength, through which we can experience the vastness of Mahatma Gandhi’s great persona.
And the British were simply unable to comprehend Gandhi Ji’s unique style of working, which encompassed both struggle and creation together.
In a way, Gandhi created two sides of the same coin; one being struggle and the other, creativity.
Gandhi’s style of working had an incredible balance.
‘New India’ is neither a government programme, nor is it the manifesto of a political party, nor is it a project.

Sometimes one is overcome by a sense of loneliness – – – students living in hostels are particularly vulnerable to it.
But I would still like to tell parents that if you notice your son or daughter or any other member of your family – – – earlier the entire family used to dine together.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal for taking up Hybrid Annuity based Public Private Partnership (PPP) model under Namami Gange Programme which aims to reform the wastewater sector in India.
Marking a paradigm shift in the implementation mode, Hybrid Annuity based Public Private Partnership (PPP) model will now be adopted to ensure performance, efficiency, viability and sustainability.
The SPV would enter into a Tripartite Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with participating State Governments and concerned Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for taking up individual projects.
These MoAs will aim at introducing reforms and regulatory measures for recovery of user charges on Polluters Pay principle, restrictions on usage of ground & fresh water for non-potable purposes through stricter monitoring and guidelines that promote re¬use of treated wastewater.
The Ministry in a first of its kind has already entered into an MoU with Ministries of Railways, for purchase of treated water from STPs wherever feasible to facilitate faster market development for treated wastewater.
Similar MoUs are also being worked out with other Ministries of Power, Petroleum, Industries etc.
This is a futuristic step taken by the Government where the market development for treated waste water and structural reforms are complementing the projects.
This will help taking up more number of projects with the same allocation as made available under Namami Gange programme with reduced financial liability in the initial years.
Spreading the stakes of the private participant over the entire period of concession would ensure continued operations over long-term.
Linking of performance standards with the annuities will ensure desired objective of treated water of appropriate standard.
It would help gradual capacity building of the Urban Local Bodies by setting ground for recovery of user charges on Polluter Pays Principle.
Development of the market for treated water will lead to reduced demand on riverine fresh-water and will result in enhanced flows in river Ganga.
These steps would also kick-start the process of responsible use of water in general and go a long way in mitigating the projected water shortage in the country.
It had been observed that benefits accrued from substantial investments made under various past programmes (Ganga Action Plan I & II, NGRBA, Yamuna Action Plan) were less than optimal.
According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), almost 30% of the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) monitored in the 4 states of UP, Uttarakhand, Bihar & West Bengal were not operational and 94% were non-compliant with the prescribed effluent standards.
Cabinet’s approval addresses the above issues that acted as road blocks for all previous efforts to clean river Ganga.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Opening Ceremony of the International Vesak Day Celebrations at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo.
The Prime Minister was greeted on arrival at the venue by Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, and Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.
Ceremonial Drummers and Traditional Dancers welcomed Prime Minister Modi, who lit a ceremonial lamp at the entrance of the auditorium.
The function began with the recital of the 5 Buddhist precepts.
He spoke of the ancient ties between the two nations, and said that Prime Minister Modi’s presence at the Vesak Day event today is of great significance, and will be taken note of, by the entire world.
The Prime Minister said he was grateful to President Maithripala Sirisena Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, and the people of Sri Lanka, for inviting him as the Chief Guest at the International Vesak Day festivities in Colombo.
“On this auspicious occasion, I also bring with me the greetings of 1.25 billion people from the land of the Samyak-sambuddha, the perfectly self awakened one,” the Prime Minister said.
Placed below are some key excerpts from the Prime Minister’s speech:
Bodh Gaya in India, where Prince Siddhartha became the Buddha, is the sacred nucleus of the Buddhist universe.
Lord Buddha’s first sermon in Varanasi, which I have the honour to represent in the Parliament, set in motion the wheel of Dhamma.
Centuries later, Anagarika Dharmapala undertook a similar journey, but this time, from Sri Lanka to India, to revive the spirit of Buddha in the land of its own origin.
The friendship between India and Sri Lanka was etched in time by the “Great Master”.
Buddhism imparts an ever present radiance to our relationship.
It draws its strength as much through our interconnected values of Buddhism as it does from the limitless possibilities of our shared future.
Ours is a friendship that lives in the hearts of our people and in the fabric of our societies.
To honour and deepen our links of Buddhist heritage, I have the great pleasure to announce that from August this year, Air India will operate direct flights between Colombo and Varanasi.
This will ease travel to the land of Buddha for my brothers and sisters from Sri Lanka, and help you directly visit Sravasti, Kusinagar, Sankasa, Kaushambi and Sarnath.
Today, India’s development cooperation with Sri Lanka amounts to US Dollars 2.6 billion.
The Middle Path shown by Buddha, speaks to all of us.
Its universality and evergreen nature are striking.
This arises principally because of Tanhaa, or Trishna in Sanskrit, the thirst, which in turn stems from greed.
Our desire to achieve all our wants has created income inequalities in communities and disturbed social harmony.
Similarly, the biggest challenge to Sustainable World Peace today is not necessarily from conflict between the nation states.
It is from the mindsets, thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence.
The menace of terrorism in our region is a concrete manifestation of this destructive emotion.
As Buddha said, “there is no higher bliss than peace”.
On Vesak, my hope is that India and Sri Lanka will work together to uphold the ideals of Lord Buddha and promote values of peace, accommodation, inclusiveness, and compassion in the policies and conduct of our governments.
This is the true path to free individuals, families, societies, nations and the world at large from the three poisons of greed, hatred and ignorance.
On the blessed day of Vesak, let us light the lamps of knowledge to move out of darkness; let us look more within; and let us uphold nothing else but the truth.
And, dedicate our efforts to follow the path of Buddha whose light shines all over the world.
As the verse 387 of Dhammapada says:
I look forward to paying homage at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, in Kandy today afternoon.
May the Triple Gem of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha bless us all.

Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the people of Chhattisgarh on the State’s Foundation Day.
“Blessed with natural beauty & home to wonderful people, Chhattisgarh’s progress has been noteworthy.
I am delighted to welcome you on your first ever visit to India.
Just last month, we witnessed a thrilling conclusion to the Border-Gavaskar trophy.
In my speech at the Australian Parliament in 2014 I had spoken of legendary Bradman and Tendulkar.
Today, Virat Kohli in India and Steven Smith in Australia are shaping the young brigades of cricket.
I hope your visit to India is as productive as it has been for Steven Smith’s batting, the other Australian Captain.
I vividly recall our meetings on the sidelines of G-20.
They have always reflected a strong sense of convergence and purpose.
I particularly appreciate your active interest in advancing the substance of our engagement.
The journey of our cooperation is firmly on course.
Under your leadership, our relationship has touched new milestones.
And, your visit gives us an opportunity to shape new priorities in our strategic partnership.
The waters of the Indian Ocean remind us of our linked histories.
They are also a pointer to our connected destinies.
The values and principles of democracy and rule of law are common to both our nations.
Today, the vast scope of opportunities in our ties is defined by a strong desire for economic prosperity by 1.25 billion people of India, and Australia’s capacities and strengths.
In our discussions today, Prime Minister and I reviewed the entire gamut of bilateral relations.
We took a number of forward-looking decisions to further strengthen our partnership, including the decision to soon hold the next round of negotiations on our Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement.
In a lighter vein I am, of course, glad that our decisions are not subject to the D.R.S. review system.
Both India and Australia recognize the central value of education and innovation in the prosperity of our societies.
It is no surprise, therefore, that cooperation in the field of education and research is one of the most important aspects of our engagement.
The Australia-India Research Fund of nearly 100 million dollars has focused on collaborative research projects in the areas such as nano-technology, smart cities, infrastructure, agriculture and disease control.
Our joint development of bananas fortified with Vitamin A has entered the phase of field trials.
Our scientists are also collaborating on developing more nutritious and hardy varieties of pulses.
These are just two examples of our outstanding scientific cooperation firmly rooted in tangible outcomes that will improve the lives of millions including our farmers.
I also extend a warm welcome to the large delegation of Vice Chancellors and Heads of Vocational Training Institutions that is accompanying Prime Minister.
A number of institution-to-institution tie-ups have been concluded during this visit.
Student exchanges are an important element of bilateral education cooperation.
Australia is home to more than 60,000 Indian students.
Increasing number of Australian students are coming to study in India.
Responding to the aspirations of India’s youth, building world class institutions in India is one of the objectives of my government.
Prime Minister Turnbull and I discussed ways by which Australian Universities could connect and contribute to this goal.
Prime Minister and I share a conviction that our economic growth and prosperity must be gentle on the environment.
We are happy that our dialogue and cooperation in other forms of energy including renewable energy is on the up-swing.
I would also like to thank Prime Minister for Australia’s decision to join the International Solar Alliance.
And, With the passing of legislation in the Australian Parliament with bi-partisan support, Australia is now ready to export Uranium to India.
Prime Minister and I recognize that our future is deeply tied to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
We, therefore, agree on the need for a secure and rule based Indo-Pacific.
We are also aware that in this globalized world, challenges like terrorism and cyber security, extend beyond the boundaries of our region.
And, therefore, require global strategy and solutions.
Indeed, Prime Minister’s understanding and insight into regional and global issues brings a new dimension to our cooperation on matters that concern us both.
Our cooperation in the area of defence and security has reached new heights.
Our maritime exercises and exchanges have been productive.
Our bilateral mechanisms on counter-terrorism and trans-national crimes are functioning well.
I am particularly pleased that we have been able to conclude an MOU on Security Cooperation during this visit.
We also agree that strong regional institutions are necessary for peace, prosperity and a sense of balance in our region.
We would, therefore, actively work to cooperate more closely with members of the East Asia Summit and the Indian Ocean Rim countries to pursue our common interests.
A major pillar of strength in our partnership is the connect between our societies.
Australia is also home to nearly half-a-million people of Indian origin.
Their prosperity and vibrant culture enrich our partnership.
A very successful Festival of India called “Confluence” was held in many cities of Australia last year.
I thank Prime Minister for all the help and support accorded to the Festival by the Australian Government.
India and Australia have made major strides in our bilateral relations in recent years.
In months and years ahead, we only see promise and opportunities for our two nations.
Our strong and vibrant strategic partnership is of course important for the security and well-being of our societies.
But, it is also a major factor for peace, stability and security in our region.
With these words, Excellency, let me welcome you once again to India, and wish you a fruitful and productive stay.
On the 3rd of October, 2014, the pious occasion of Vijayadashmi, we embarked upon a journey together through the medium of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
Anshu Kumar & Amar Kumar from Delhi on Mygov, Vikas Yadav from Patna; on similar lines Monica Jain from Delhi, Prosenjit Sarkar from Bardhaman, West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur converge in asking a shared question.
It was a tiny joint; there was only one person who would make & serve tea.
He was not even adequately clad; it was a standalone kiosk on the edge of the road.
He first picked up a Laddoo from a glass container, offered the sweetmeat to me & said, “Sir, eat this before the tea get ready”.
On seeing his rather jubilant exuberance, I asked him, “But what exactly happened?”
And he replied, “India has exploded the bomb today!”
It was matter of great intrigue to me to see a lone tea seller in a remote, snow – clad hilly place,who possibly kept listening to the radio the entire day… watching that particular effect of the news on radio led me to realize & internalise that this was a medium that was truly connected with the masses… and that it was a mighty means of getting across.
In terms of the reach & depth of communication, radio has been incomparable.
I have been nursing that feeling ever since, acknowledging its power & strength.
And in 2014, when I took charge as the Pradhan Sevak, Principal Servant, it was my wish to reach out to the masses with the glorious saga of our country’s unity, her grand history, her valour, India’s diversity, our cultural diversity, virtues embedded in our society such as Purusharth, Tapasya, Passion & sacrifice; in a nutshell, the great story of India.
From remote villages to Metro cities, from farmers to young professionals … the array just prompted me to embark upon this journey of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
Recently, All India Radio got a survey done on ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
The medium of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has promoted many a mass revolution. #indiapositive has been the subject of quite an extensive discussion.
I am overjoyed on account of the fact that through ‘Mann Ki Baat’, radio is rising as a popular medium, more than ever before.
The fact is, if a leader gets hold of a microphone with assured listeners to the tune of millions, what else does he need?
Significantly, some young friends have attempted a study on the myriad subjects touched upon, over the many episodes of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
They did a lexical analysis of all the episodes to calculate the frequency of occurrence of particular words; whether there were some words that were oft-repeated!
When ‘Mann Ki Baat’ commenced, I had firmly decided that it would carry nothing political, or any praise for the Government, nor Modi for that matter anywhere.
The greatest bulwark in ensuring adherence to my resolve; in fact my highest inspiration, have been you.
As a run up to each episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the expectations & aspirations of listeners through their letters, online comments & phone calls are crystal clear.
Modi may come and go, but this country will never let go of its UNITY & permanence, our culture will always be immortal.
This new inspiration & zest will keep taking her to greater heights.
At times, when I look back, I am taken aback.
Who would have imagined that a small campaign “selfie with daughter”starting from a small village in Haryana would spread not only throughout the country but also across other countries as well.
Their heartsand my heart beat to the same rhythm.
In a way your question were the a personal,amiable touch.
My countrymen stay in my heart every moment and that is how the writer’s situation and ideas expressed in the letter become part of my thought process.
There are lakhs of persons whose names I have not been able to include in Mann Ki Baat but without any disappointment,they continue to sendin their letters and comments.
There are old baggage’s of our own lives and when they do not come in the way, it becomes easier to understand others.
I try to share the efforts and achievements of the youth as much as possible through “Mann Ki Baat”.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram- has posted on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat I should talk about the “Constitution Day” which falls on the26th November.
Democracy was embedded deep in Baba Saheb’s nature and he used to say that India’s democratic values have not been imported from outside.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the loss of lives due to capsizing of a boat in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district.

It will also enable the provision of adequate support to educational institutes for knowledge sharing, availability of job opportunities and fulfil the vision of Digital India.
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are of immense strategic significance for India.
The geographical configuration and the location of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands chain in the Bay of Bengal safeguard India’s eastern seaboard.
Then, there is an issue of redundancy, that is, no alternate media is available in case of any emergency.
Lack of bandwidth and telecom connectivity is also hampering socio-economic development of the islands.

Terrorism remains one of the greatest challenges to global peace and security.

1.Fareed Zakaria: After your election people have begun asking again a question that has been asked many times for the last two decades, which is, will India be the next China.
Prime Minister: India does not need to become anything else.
India must become only India.
This is a country that once upon a time was called ‘the golden bird’.
We have fallen from where we were before.
But now we have the chance to rise again.
Their contributions to global GDP have risen in parallel, and fallen in parallel.
Today’s era once again belongs to Asia.
India and China are both growing rapidly, together.
That is why India needs to remain India.
2.Fareed Zakaria: But people would still I think wonder can India achieve the kind of 8 & 9 % growth rates that China has done consistently for 30 years and India has only done for a short period.
There is a lot of capability.
And I have a clear road-map to channel it.
3.Fareed Zakaria: China’s behavior in the east China seas and the south China seas over the last two years has worried many of its neighbors.
The head of the governments in Philippines and Vietnam have made very sharp statements worrying about it.
Do you worry about it?
Prime Minister: India is different.
It is a country of 1.25 billion people.
We can’t run our country if we get worried about every small thing.
At the same time, we can’t close our eyes to problems.
That’s why India maintains that we are now in a different era.
We are not living in the eighteenth century.
China is also a country with an ancient cultural heritage.
That is why we should have trust in China’s understanding and have faith that it would accept global laws and will play its role in cooperating and moving forward.
4.Fareed Zakaria: Do you look at China and feel that it has been able to develop as fast as it has, really the fastest development in human history, because it is an authoritarian government, because the government has the power to build great infrastructure, to create incentives for investment.
Do you look at that and think to yourself that that would be, there is a price to democracy that you have to do things a little bit more slowly.
Prime Minister: If China is one example, then democratic countries provide another example.
They have also grown fast.
You can’t say that growth is not possible because of democracy.
Democracy is our commitment.
Democracy is in our DNA.
5.Fareed Zakaria: You don’t look at the power of the Chinese government and wish you had some of that authority.
Prime Minister: See, I have seen the strength of democracy.
If there were no democracy then someone like me, Modi, a child born in a poor family, how would he sit here?
This is the strength of democracy.
6.Fareed Zakaria: There are many people in the United States and some in India who wish that the United States and India were much closer allies.
This characterizes both the societies.
Indians and Americans have coexistence in their natural temperament.
Now, yes, for sure, there have been ups and downs in our relationship in the last century.
But from the end of the 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century, has witnessed a big change.
Our ties have deepened.
India and the United States of America are bound together, by history and by culture.
These ties will deepen further.
7.Fareed Zakaria: So far in your contacts with the Obama administration, you have had several cabinet ministers come here.
Do you feel that there is a genuine desire from Washington to try to upgrade the relationship with India substantially?
Prime Minister: Relations between India and America should not be seen within the limits of just Delhi and Washington.
It’s a much larger sphere.
The good thing is that the mood of both Delhi and Washington is in harmony with this understanding.
Both sides have played a role in this.
8.Fareed Zakaria: With regard to Russia’s action in Ukraine.
India has not been particularly active.
Do you, how do you view Russia’s annexation of the Crimea.
Prime Minister: Firstly, whatever happened there, innocent people died in a plane accident.
We have always expressed those views.
There is a saying in India that the person who should throw a stone first is the person who has not committed any sins.
In the world right now, a lot of people want to give advice.
But look within them, and they too have sinned in some way.
Ultimately, India’s view point is that efforts need to be made to sit together and talk, and to resolve problems in an ongoing process.
9.Fareed Zakaria: One of the areas that India has come on to the world scene or people have read about and heard about it, which has been unfortunate has been violence against women.
This issue of rape.
Prime Minister: Look, us political pundits shouldn’t tangle ourselves up in knots by searching for the root cause of this problem.
More damage is done by statements from political pundits.
Dignity of women is our collective responsibility.
There should be no compromise in this matter.
There should be no erosion in the law and order situation.
We have to revive the family culture in which a woman is respected and considered equal, her dignity encouraged.
The main thing here is girl child education.
10.Fareed Zakaria: Ayman-al- Zawahiri the head of Al Qaida has issued a video and an appeal trying to create an Al Qaida in India.
In south Asia he says but the message was really directed towards India and he says he wants to free Muslims from the oppression they face in Gujarat, in Kashmir.
If anyone thinks Indian Muslims will dance to their tune, they are delusional.
Indian Muslims will live for India.
They will die for India.
They will not want anything bad for India.
What is it that has made this community not as susceptible?
Prime Minister: Firstly, I am not the authority for doing a psychological and religious analysis on this … But the question is, whether or not humanity should be defended in the world?
Whether or not believers in humanity should unite?
So we have to frame this as a fight between humanity and inhumanity.
Nothing else.
12.Fareed Zakaria: When you look a year or two from now.
Let us say a year from now.
What would you like people to say that you have accomplished in your first year in office.
Prime Minister: See the biggest thing is that the people of the country have faith.
That trust should never break.
The public should have faith that this is the government they elected, and it’s trying to work for their welfare with honesty and commitment.
That’s the biggest thing.
If I can win the confidence of the people of India—not from my speeches—but by actions, then the power of 1.25 billion Indians will come together to take the country forward.
13.Fareed Zakaria: How do you relax?
What do you enjoy doing when you are not working?
Prime Minister: Look, I’m not the “not-working” type.
I derive pleasure from my work.
Work gives me relaxation too.
Every moment I am thinking of something new: making a new plan, new ways to work.
In the same way that a scientist draws pleasure from long hours in the laboratory, I draw pleasure in governance, in doing new things and bringing people together.
That pleasure is sufficient for me.
14.Fareed Zakaria: Do you meditate?
Do you do Yoga?
Prime Minister: I’m fortunate that I was introduced to the world of yoga and pranayama at an early age.
That has been very useful to me.
I always advise everyone to make this a part of their lives.
15.Fareed Zakaria: You gave a long speech about the benefits of Yoga.
Explain what you see them as.
That is Yoga.

He mentioned that this is a new feature of IAS training begun with the 2013 batch, and it ensures that IAS officers have a stint at the Centre right at the beginning of their career – an opportunity that their seniors may not have had.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu, the Chief Minister of Haryana, Shri Manohar Lal, and the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Shri Harish Rawat, today called on the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, and submitted the final report of the sub-group of Chief Ministers on Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan.
The Prime Minister complimented the Chief Ministers for their efforts.
He said that the task of accomplishing Swachh Bharat, though difficult, is not impossible to achieve.
Further, it has been recommended that one day in each month and one week each year (culminating with 2nd October) may be assigned for the activities of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and to reward best performing Gram Panchayat, Block, ULB, District and State as per the ratings.
The report proposes to enhance the assistance for construction of one unit of individual household toilet in both urban and rural areas to Rs. 15,000/-.
The report recommends integration of rag pickers into the waste management system so that their livelihood is not adversely affected.
Further, both Centre and States should make efforts towards eradication of manual scavenging activity through strict enforcement of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.
The Prime Minister said that the 330 MW Kishanganga Hydropower project would go a long way in fulfilling the electricity requirements of the State.
He emphasized the need for balanced development of all three regions of the State – Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approvedconveying of no objection to reduction in Government of India shareholding in IDBI Bank Limited to below 50% by dilution.
The acquisition has wide-ranging synergy benefits for customers, LIC and the bank.
Benefits to the two entities emanate from economies of scale, reduction in the costs of distribution and customer acquisition, greater efficiency and flexibility in operations, and greater opportunity for cross-selling of products and services.
These would help financially strengthen both LIC and the bank, as well as their subsidiaries which offer financial products such as housing finance and mutual funds.
Further, the bank would get an opportunity to tap 11 lakh LIC agents for doorstep banking services, positioning it to improve customer services and deepen financial inclusion.
The bank would also be positioned to benefit in terms of lower cost of funds through acquisition of low-cost deposits, and fee income from payment services.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved a Memorandum of Understanding which has been signed between Indian and Belgian government authorities at the Federal and regional level for energy.
The objective of this Memorandum of Understanding is to establish the basis for a cooperative institutional relationship to encourage and promote technical bilateral cooperation on new and renewable energy issues on the basis of mutual benefit, equality and reciprocity.
The areas of cooperation will focus on development of new and renewable energy technologies in the field of Wind energy, Biomass, Solar (thermal and photovoltaic), Smart grids, Geothermal energy, Marine energy, contribution of renewables to diversification of supply and energy security, and any other mutually agreed areas.
It is a true pleasure to welcome Her Excellency Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India.
Every Indian takes pride in the knowledge that Indian soldiers and बीर मुक्तिजोधा fought together to liberate Bangladesh from the reign of terror.
We agreed that the agenda of our cooperation has to remain focused on purposeful action.
We specifically looked at charting new avenues and tapping fresh opportunities in advancing our relationship.
We want to build cooperation in new areas, especially some high-technology areas, that have a deeper connect with the youth in both our societies.
These would include working in the fields of Electronics, Information Technology, Cyber Security, Space exploration, Civil Nuclear Energy, and others areas.
India has always stood for the prosperity of Bangladesh and its people.
We are a long-standing and trusted development partner of Bangladesh.
India and Bangladesh are also determined that the fruits of our cooperation must benefit our people.
In this context, I am happy to announce a new concessional Line of Credit of 4.5 billion dollars for the implemntation of projects in priority sectors for Bangladesh.
This brings our resource allocation for Bangladesh to more than 8 billion dollars over the past six years.
Energy Security is an important dimension of our development partnership.
And, our energy partnerhship continues to grow.
Today, we added an additional 60 Mega Watt of power to the 600 Mega Watt of power already flowing from India to Bangladesh.
The supply of another 500 Mega Watt has already been committed from the existing inter-connection.
We have also agreed to finance the diesel oil pipeline from Numaligarh to Parbatipur.
Our companies are entering into a long-term agreement for the supply of high speed diesel to Bangladesh.
We have also agreed on a time table for regular supply till the pipeline is constructed.
We are encouraging private sectors in both our countries to enter this space.
Several agreements for investments in the energy sector in Bangladesh are expected to be signed by the Indian companies in the coming days.
India will continue to be a willing partner in meeting the energy needs of Bangladesh, and its goal of achieving ‘Power for all by 2021’.
Connectivity is crucial for the success of bilateral development partnership, sub-regional economic projects and for the larger regional economic prosperity.
Today, together with the Honourable Chief Minister of West Bengal , we have added several new links to our growing connectivity.
Bus and train links between Kolkata and Khulna, and राधिकापुर-बीरोल have been restored today.
In-land water-ways routes are being optimized.
And, steps are being taken to put into operation the Coastal Shipping Agreement.
We are also happy to see the progress being made in two-way trans-shipment of goods.
We look forward to early implemntation of the B.B.I.N. Motor Vehicles Agreement.
This would usher in a new era of sub-regional integration.
Not just to forge wide-ranging business partnerships between our two economies.
But also for greater regional benefit.
In this, a major part of the effort has to be from the business and industry of the two countries.
We are happy to receive the high powered business delegation accompanying the Prime Minister.
Our agreement to open new Border Haats will empower border communities through trade and contribute to their livelihoods.
The training of 1500 Bangladesh civil servants in India has almost concluded.
We would undertake training along similar lines for 1500 Judicial Officers of Bangladesh in our judicial academies.
While our partnership brings prosperity to our people, it also works to protect them from forces of radicaliztion and extremism.
Her Government’s ‘zero-tolerance’ policy towards terrorism is an inspiration for all of us.
We agreed that peace, security and development for our people and for the region will remain central to our engagement.
Today, we have also taken a long overdue step by signing an agreement on close cooperation between our armed forces.
I am also happy to announce a Line of Credit of US dollars 500 million to support Bangladesh’s defence related procurement.
In implementing this line of credit, we will be guided by Bangladesh’s needs and priorities.
Our two countries share one of the longest land boundaries.
During my visit to Dhaka in June 2015, we had concluded the Land Boundary Agreement.
Its implemntation is now underway.
Along with our shared land boundaries are our shared rivers.
They sustain our peoples and their livelihoods.
And, the one that has attracted the greatest attention is the Teesta.
This is important for India, for Bangladesh and for India-Bangladesh relationship.
I am very happy that the Chief Minister of West Bengal is my honoured guest today .
I know that her feelings for Bangladesh are as warm as my own.
I assure you and the people of Bangladesh of our commitment and continuing efforts.
Bangabandu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a dear friend of India and a towering leader.
As a mark of our respect and deep admiration for the father of Bangladesh, a prominent road in our capital city has been named after him.
His life, struggle and contribution to the creation of Bangladesh will continue to inspire future generations.
To mark the Golden Jubilee Year of Bangladesh’s independence in 2021, we have agreed to jointly produce a documentary film on the Liberation War of Bangladesh.
We in India rejoice in our ties with Bangladesh.
Ties that have been forged in blood and generations of kin-ship.
Ties that seek a better and secure future for our people.
With these words, Excellency, I once again welcome you and your delegation to India.

• Distributes, e-rickshaws, pedal rickshaws.
• Beneficiaries to get Jan Dhan Accounts and RuPay cards.
• PM interacts with beneficiaries, shares their dreams with people.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today launched a significant financial inclusion initiative in Varanasi.
A total of 101 e-rickshaws, 501 pedal rickshaws, and push-carts are being given as part of this initiative.
The beneficiaries will also get bank accounts and RuPay cards under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
The e-rickshaws are equipped with digital gadgets including GPRS and cameras.
The initiative has been synergized through various financial institutions including SIDBI, IDBI Bank, UCO Bank and the American India Foundation.
Senior officials of these organizations were present on the occasion.
The Prime Minister declared that this event marked the beginning of an initiative that would bring about a change in the fortunes of the people of Varanasi.
He said a lot has been said about removal of poverty, but those efforts have not brought adequate results for several decades.
He said that there is a need to increase the pace and the scale of the outcomes of the initiatives to remove poverty.
He said the poor are willing to work hard to improve the lives of the future generations.
In this connection, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government was putting emphasis on skill development, to help make the poor self-reliant.
The Prime Minister had earlier interacted with some of the beneficiaries who received rickshaws and push-carts.
He shared their dreams with the gathering, which ranged from a better education for their children, to a boost in income that would result from enhanced sales with the aid of a push-cart.
Your Excellency President Xi Jinping, Your Excellency President Jacob Zuma, Your Excellency President Michel Temer, Your Excellency President Vladimir Putin,
I join 1.25 billion Indians in once again extending a very warm welcome to all of you in Goa for the eighth (8th) BRICS Summit.
I am honoured to chair the BRICS Leaders’ Plenary Meeting.
Our exchanges earlier during the day were productive.
This session should build on them and deliberate on a pro-active agenda of action for BRICS.
The footprint of intra-BRICS engagement has expanded over time to include large areas of economic activity.
The scope of our partnership today stretches from agriculture to industry and innovation; trade to tourism; environment to energy; films to football; skill development to smart cities; and from fighting corruption and money laundering to securing our societies.
This year, we have taken BRICS to our cities and provinces and linked it directly to our people from different walks of life.
We are celebrating 10 years of our partnership under BRICS.
A decade of collaboration has produced strong benefits of cooperation.
We are entitled to take pride in our initiatives and achievements.
The establishment of New Development Bank and the Contingency Reserve Arrangement are indeed signature achievements.
In a world of new security challenges and continuing economic uncertainties, BRICS stands as a beacon of peace potential and promise.
Our work holds much meaning for the developing world.
In the past year, BRICS have played an active role in shaping the global agenda for change and development.
Our association with Agenda 2030, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development has been purposeful and productive.
And, we remain at the forefront of pushing change in the global governance architectures.
While our achievements have been substantial, we need to sustain the positive direction and strong momentum of intra-BRICS engagement.
We also need to add more content to it.
Let me offer some thoughts for your consideration.
First, the process of institution building in BRICS must continue to remain a focus area.
The institutions that we build must support the development of our countries and regions.
They should enable greater flexibility and freedom, and offer wider choices in responding to our developmental priorities.
We look forward to translating into reality the idea of a BRICS Credit Rating Agency.
We must also speed up the work on setting up BRICS Agriculture Research Centre, BRICS Railway Research Network, and BRICS Sports Council.
There is also a clear need to build norms, create structures and pool our capacities to stop tax evasion, and fight against black money and corruption.
Our agencies must also build mechanisms of information sharing to bring to justice the tax offenders and money launderers.
BRICS should push for empowering the global governance institutions to reflect today’s reality.
Second, transform the quantum and quality of trade and investment linkages among BRICS.
In 2015, intra-BRICS trade stood at about 250 billion US Dollars.
We should set ourselves a target to double this number to US Dollars five hundred billion by 2020.
This requires businesses and industry in all five countries to scale up their engagement.
And, for governments to facilitate this process to the fullest.
Our agreement on a tax and custom cooperation framework is a good start.
The BRICS Trade Fair and Exhibition just concluded in New Delhi should become a regular platform for business exchanges.
And, the BRICS New Development Bank must play an active role to support this objective.
It can also help integrate our SMEs into global value chains.
We must also coordinate closely to preserve the central role of the Doha Development Round and the WTO.
Alongside, we should increase our cooperation and convergence at the G-20, WTO and other fora.
India has tabled a draft of the Trade Facilitation Agreement for Services at the WTO.
It seeks to maximize the benefits of services liberalization and trade to the developing countries.
A strong BRICS support to this proposal will be in our collective economic interest.
Third, focus on key priorities of our economic transformations.
Urbanization, infrastructure and innovation represent the key focus areas for BRICS economies.
Under India’s Chairmanship, we have placed emphasis on digital- technology, smart-cities, urbanization, and cooperation between our cities.
The next billion internet users will come from emerging markets.
Our cooperation must grab this opportunity to transform the basic structure of our economies.
Fourth, secure our societies.
In the world we inhabit today, security and counter-terrorism cooperation is necessary if we are to secure the lives of our citizens.
Terrorism casts a long shadow on our development and economic prosperity.
Its reach is now global.
It has grown more lethal and adept at the use of technology.
Selective approaches to terrorist individuals and organizations will not only be futile but also counter-productive.
There must be no distinction based on artificial and self-serving grounds.
Criminality should be the only basis for punitive action against the individuals and organizations responsible for carrying out terrorist acts.
Terrorist funding, their weapons supply, training and political support must be systematically cut off.
In this respect, we need to deepen the security cooperation between our National Security Advisors.
Early adoption of the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism will be an expression of our resolve to fight this menace.
Fifth, thriving people-to-people exchanges is the lifeblood of BRICS.
It brings vibrancy and richness to our partnership.
We have chosen to highlight this dimension this year.
The BRICS Films Festival, Trade Fair, Tourism Convention, Sports Council, Football Tournament and other related activities will help in creating millions of young stakeholders that will ultimately carry our partnership forward.
I am eager to hear from my fellow BRICS leaders on their vision for a stronger, deeper and vibrant BRICS community.
I thank you for your attention.
PM’s 14th interaction through PRAGATI
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired his fourteenth interaction through PRAGATI – the ICT-based, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation.
The Prime Minister reviewed the progress towards handling and resolution of grievances related to school education and literacy.
He said that there is now an expectation among the people, that the Government will be able to resolve these grievances.
The Prime Minister specifically asked concerned officials to systematize the measures being taken by them to address grievances of students.
He instructed them to use all available technological tools to ensure that school-children do not face inconvenience.
He appreciated the sensitivity that has been shown in this regard by various departments of the Central and State Governments.
During an appraisal of the progress of Aadhaar enrolment, it was noted that overall enrolment is now close to 105 crore, and special attention is being given to the North-Eastern States which are lacking in this regard.
The Prime Minister urged States to accelerate enrolment among children in the 5 to 18 age-group so that scholarships and other educational benefits become more accessible to them.
The Prime Minister also reviewed the progress of vital infrastructure projects in the road, railway and power sectors, spread over several states including Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim and Maharashtra.
Among the projects reviewed was Nangal Dam – Talwara Railway line, which was first sanctioned in 1981-82, and has been pending since then.
He laid the foundation Stone of Employees’ State Insurance Corporation’s (ESIC) multi speciality Hospital at Tiruppur.
This State-of-the-art, 100- bedded Hospital will cater to the medical needs of over one-lakh workers and their family members in Tiruppur and nearby areas covered under ESI Act.
Earlier these people were catered by the two ESIC dispensaries functioning in the city.
For any advanced medical intervention, they had to travel at least 50 km to reach the ESIC Medical College Hospital in Coimbatore.
He dedicated to the nation, ESIC Hospital Chennai.
This 470-bedded hospital with state of art facilities will provide quality treatment on all disciplines of medicine.
PM also laid foundation stone for a new integrated building at Trichy Airport and for the modernization of Chennai airport.
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL’s) Ennore Coastal Terminal was dedicated to the nation on this occasion.
It will be a bigger and better alternative to its Tondiarpet facility.
With this terminal in place, products can be moved along the coast from Kochi, thereby also reducing the cost of movement by road.
Prime Minister Modi also inaugurated new Crude Oil Pipeline from Chennai Port to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (CPCL) Manali Refinery.
The pipeline, built with enhanced safety features, will ensure safe and reliable supply of crude oil, and will cater to the needs of Tamil Nadu and neighbouring states.
Passenger Service for a section of Chennai Metro from AG-DMS Metro station to Washermenpet Metro Station was inaugurated by PM.
This 10 km section is a part of Phase-1 of Chennai Metro.
With this stretch all 45 km of the Phase I project becomes operational.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today has given its approval for signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Afghanistan on cooperation in the field of Human Resource Development.
Through this MoU, Government of India would provide access and share the technology of other major ICT Initiatives in Education such as National Digital Library of India (NDLI), Virtual Labs, Spoken Tutorials.
It is also proposed to establish Joint Master Degree Programmes between Indian and Afghanistan Universities / Institutions.
MHRD would assist the Ministry of Higher Education, Afghanistan in the areas of Curriculum Development and Capacity Development of Teaching Staff.
This is expected to promote student mobility under Study in India program, by attracting more foreign students to come and study in Afghan Institutions.
This MoU would be a significant mile-stone in the collaboration between two countries in education sector.
India and Afghanistan have strong diplomatic relations in various areas including education.
SWAYAM, India’s own MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) platform is one such major initiative, which offers various online courses prepared by the best faculty from across the country.
Till date, more than 35 Lakhs students have enrolled in about 2000 courses that have been offered through SWAYAM.
This includes courses from Class 9th to Post-Graduation and also for lifelong learning.
The students can avail credit transfer upto 20 % for the courses done through SWAYAM.
Excellency Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
I have been informed that Singapore is leading the world in putting driverless cars on the road.
Excellency Lee, you are a friend of India.
We commend your commitment and contribution to strengthening our ties.
It is indeed a great honour for me to welcome you here today.
This year, we were saddened by the demise of another great son of Singapore, former President S. R. Nathan.
He was a close friend of India, and we had the honour to confer on him the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman.
We will miss him.
To deliver benefits to both our people, our partnership aims to combine the strengths of Singapore with the scale of India; and dynamism of Singapore with vibrancy of our States.
During my visit last year we had drawn up a road map to realize our ambitious cooperative agenda.
Expeditious implementation of agreed decisions has also been an important element of our engagement.
Today, Excellency Lee and I undertook a detailed review of the shape and substance of our strategic partnership.
During my visit to Singapore, Prime Minister Lee had taken me on a visit to the Institute for Technical Education.
Rajasthan is also partnering with Singapore in the fields of urban development and waste management.
Singapore is already our partner in developing Amaravati, the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh.
The trade and investment ties form the bedrock of our bilateral relationship.
We enjoy a strong network of business to business partnerships.
In this context, Prime Minister Lee and I have agreed to expedite the second review of our Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement.
The MOU on Intellectual Property, which has been signed today, will facilitate greater business to business exchanges and collaborations.
Prime Minister Lee and I also welcome the issuance of corporate Rupee bonds in Singapore.
It is a step forward in our efforts to mobilize capital for India’s large infrastructure development needs.
Our defence and security cooperation is a key pillar of our strategic partnership.
As two maritime nations, keeping the sea lanes of communication open, and respect for international legal order of seas and oceans is a shared priority.
Our cooperation in the framework of ASEAN, East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Regional Framework is aimed at building an open and inclusive architecture for regional cooperation, in an atmosphere of trust and confidence.
Rising tide of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, and the rise of radicalization are grave challenges to our security.
They threaten the very fabric of our societies.
It is my firm belief that those who believe in peace and humanity need to stand and act together against this menace.
India has embarked on a path of strong economic growth and transformation.
In this journey, we regard Singapore as a key partner.
Recently, we benefitted from Deputy Prime Minister Shanmugaratnam’s ideas on transforming India.
I also deeply value your personal friendship, and your leadership in taking our bilateral relationship forward.
Once again, I extend to you and your delegation my warmest welcome.
I am confident that your visit to India will be productive and successful.
The State Government has offered 1.6 acres of land in lieu of 1.6 acres land of AAI and agreed to undertake and relocate all the existing infrastructure of AAI on the subject land on its own cost.
The exchange of land is not only beneficial to the State Government & AAI but also to the people.
Odisha Government wants to widen the State Government road near Bhubaneswar Airport (known as Ekamara Marg/Palashpalli Road) for streamlining the security arrangements of the VIP movements and creating buffer zone for public use.
For this purpose requires 1.6 acres land of AAI is required by the State Government.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today spoke at the opening session of the Conference of Governors at Rashtrapati Bhawan.
Mentioning the target of New India by 2022, the Prime Minister emphasized that this can be achieved only by making it a people’s movement.
Giving the example of the recent Hackathon conducted by the Union Government, where students had proposed technology solutions to several problems, he said Universities should be centres of innovation.
He encouraged Governors to lead by example on the cause of Swachhata, or cleanliness.
He said that Governors can also motivate banks to give loans under Mudra to tribals, Dalits and women, especially in the period between Constitution Day on November 26th, and Ambedkar Mahaparinirvana Diwas on December 6th.

The National Salt Satyagraha Memorial, dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister on January 30, 2019, recreates the spirit and the energy of one of the defining moments of India’s freedom struggle.
It is a depiction of the Dandi March by the Mahatma, and 80 of his fellow Satyagrahis – the occasion when a pinch of salt rocked the colonial rule.
While launching this scheme, he had said “A clean India would be the best tribute India could pay to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary in 2019”.
For the past four and half years, the scheme has been transformingthe length and breadth of India.
It has resulted in heightened awareness among the general public.
The interest in Khadi had waned since those heady days.
But it has been revived by the Prime Minister, especially through his speeches.

In addition, there will be a Medical College, AYUSH Block, Auditorium, Night Shelter, Guest House, Hostels and residential facilities.
The establishment of the new AIIMS will create capital assets for which requisite specialized manpower will be created, based on the pattern of the six new AIIMS, for their maintenance and upkeep.
Setting up of new AIIMS would not only transform health education and training but also address the shortfall of health care professionals in the region.
Setting up new AIIMS in the states will lead to employment generation for nearly 3000 people in various faculty & non faculty posts in each of the AIIMS.
Further, indirect employment generation will take place due to facilities & services like shopping centre, canteens, etc. coming in the vicinity of new AIIMS.
The construction activity involved for creation of the physical infrastructure for the various new AIIMS is also expected to generate substantial employment in the construction phase as well.

This is the third time I am attending these Summits.
East Asia Summit is the premier forum for discussions on the challenges and opportunities before the Asia Pacific region.
Our ties with the countries of South East Asia are truly historic.
Our engagement and approach can be best encapsulated in just one word – connectivity.
Your Excellencies
Our interaction during the restricted session was constructive.
It enriched our mutual understanding and perspectives.
After more than a decade of existence, BRICS has developed a robust framework for cooperation.
We contribute stability and growth in a world drifting towards uncertainty.
While trade and economy have been the foundation of our cooperation, our endeavours today touch diverse areas of technology, tradition, culture, agriculture, environment, energy, sports, and ICT.
The New Development Bank has started disbursing loans in pursuit of its mandate to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development in BRICS countries.
We are in mission-mode to eradicate poverty; to ensure health, sanitation, skills, food security, gender equality, energy, education and innovation.
National programmes of Clean Ganga, Renewable Energy, Digital India, Smart Cities, Housing for All and Skill India are laying the basis for clean, green and inclusive development.
They are also tapping the creative energy of our 800 million youth.
Our women’s empowerment programmes are productivity multipliers that mainstream women in nation building.
We have also stepped up the fight against black money and corruption.
First, last year we discussed pooling our efforts to create a BRICS rating agency.
An Expert Group has since been studying the viability of such an agency.
I would urge that the roadmap for its creation should be finalized at the earliest.
Third, affordable, reliable, and sustainable access to energy is crucial for the development of our nations.
It will bring together a coalition of 121 countries for mutual gains through enhanced solar energy utilisation.
Our five countries have complementary skills and strengths to promote use of renewable and solar energy.
We would wish to see more clean energy funding, particularly in solar energy, from the NDB.
Fourth, we are nations with large youth populations.
We need to mainstream our youth in our joint initiatives as far as possible.
Fifth, at the Goa Summit last year we had exchanged thoughts on smart-cities, urbanization, and disaster-management in the context of cooperation between our cities.
Sixth, Technology and innovation are the foundations of the next generation of global growth and transformation.
In the last decade, two generations of leader of our countries contributed to the emergence and establishment of BRICS.
We acquired credibility, wielded influence and spurred growth.
Now, the next decade is crucial.
In an environment where we seek stability, sustainable development and prosperity.
BRICS leadership will be crucial in driving this transformation.
If we as BRICS can set the agenda in these areas, the world will call this its Golden Decade.
I am confident that it will help the BRICS in our shared journey to scale new heights of partnership.
(ii) That the Madhya Pradesh Government will pay for the difference in the area of the land measuring 0.59 acres at the present land rates as both the lands are in the same zone of land rates.
(iii) That the Madhya Pradesh Government will pay the occupation charges on 0.89 acre already in possession at the present land rates, till it is surrendered by Govt. of Madhya Pradesh to L&DO/MoHUA.

The Madhya Pradesh Government will not utilise this land for any purpose other than for construction of its State Guest House.
Excellency, the warmth of your hospitality and welcome during my visit to the Kyrgyz Republic in July last year is still fresh in my mind.
Your visit this time helps us to carry forward the momentum of our cooperation and high level contacts.
We are also bound by a common belief in democratic values and traditions.
President Atambayev and I held extensive discussions on the full range of our bilateral engagement.
We focused on our common priority of diversifying and deepening bilateral engagement.
We also discussed how we could work together to secure our youth and society against the common challenges of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism.
We agreed on the need to coordinate and work closely in addressing and overcoming these challenges for our common benefit.
We regard Kyrgyz Republic as a valuable partner in our common pursuit of making Central Asia a region of sustainable peace, stability and prosperity.
Our joint military exercises on counter-terrorism are now an annual feature.
The next edition has been planned for first quarter of next year in Kyrgyz Republic.
President Atambayev and I agreed on the need to connect our economies more deeply.
We will encourage industry and business on both sides to play a leading role in exploiting opportunities in healthcare, tourism, information technology, agriculture, mining and energy.
We have decided to build on our development cooperation including in capacity building and training.
People have been at the center of such initiatives.
We shall give special emphasis to youth exchanges in our technical and economic cooperation programme with Kyrgyz Republic.
The understandings concluded today will support our thrust in these directions.
We are taking steps to expand this project to other regions of the Kyrgyz Republic.
India and the Kyrgyz Republic will be marking the 25th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in March 2017.
As we approach this milestone, President Atambayev’s visit to India will drive the process and our efforts of deepening our partnership.
It will also help consolidate the recent gains in our engagement and reinforce our ties in the months and years ahead.
I wish President Atambaev a memorable and productive visit in India.
Two Groups of Secretaries to the Government of India, today presented ideas on Education and Crisis Management, to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.
With this, all nine presentations on various governance related themes have now been made in the current series.
Speaking at the conclusion of the presentations, the Prime Minister emphasized that the Union Government is open to new ideas.
The focus of the budget is on issues ranging from agriculture to Infrastructure.
On the one hand, the budget covers aspects such as health plans to address the concerns of the poor and middle class, while on the other hand it has plans to increase the wealth of small entrepreneurs in the country.
Other aspects range from food processing to fiber optics, from road to shipping, concerns of youth to those of senior citizens, rural India to Ayushman India and Digital India to Start up India.
The budget is expected to give a boost to the hopes and aspirations of 125 crore people of the country.
It is expected to accelerate the development process of the country.
It is farmer friendly, common man friendly, business environment friendly as well as development friendly.
More savings for the middle class, new generation infrastructure for 21st Century India and assurance of better health – all these are concrete steps towards Ease of Living.
We have seen how Amul was instrumental in ensuring fair price to the farmers engaged in the dairy sector.
We are also familiar with the cluster based approach for the development of the industry in our country.
Now, keeping in mind the agricultural produce in different districts, agricultural cluster approach will be adopted in different districts across the country.
I welcome the plan to develop storage, processing and marketing facilities for a particular agricultural produce after identifying the relevant districts.
In our country, the cooperative societies are exempted from paying income tax.
Therefore, income tax exemption for the ‘Farmer Producer Organization’ -FPO, which is meant for the welfare of the farmers, is a welcome step.
By providing the linkages between the Self Help Groups for women engaged in organic, aromatic and herbal cultivation and the ‘Farmer Producer Organizations’ the income of the farmers will be increased.
Similarly, the Gobar-Dhan Yojana will help in keeping the village clean, while increasing the income of farmers and cattle herders.
In our country farmers take up different occupations along with the farming.
Some are associated with pisciculture, animal husbandry, poultry or bee-keeping.
In these blocks, emphasis has been laid on modernization of infrastructure of 22 thousand rural business centers, by innovative and increased connectivity in the villages.
No tax will be levied on interest up to Rs 50,000 on their Bank and Post Office deposits.
Health insurance premium worth Rs 50,000 will be exempt from the Income tax.
Besides, relief from Income Tax has been provided on expenditure up to Rs 1 lakh incurred on treatment of serious diseases.
For a long time, the small and medium enterprises or the MSME in our country had to pay higher taxes than the big industries.
A bold step has been taken in this budget wherein the government has reduced the tax rate for MSME by 5%.
They will now have to pay only 25% tax in place of 30% which was the practice earlier.
MSME sector has been experiencing stress due to NPA in big industries.
The small entrepreneurs must not suffer because of the fault of others.
Therefore, the government will soon announce corrective measures to resolve the problems related to NPA and Stressed Account in the MSME sector.
This will give a push to shift from informal to formal sector and will generate new job opportunities.
Now the government will contribute 12% in EPF Account of new laborers for a period of 3 years.
This is a major step towards empowerment of working women.
In order to realize the dream of modern India, to enhance Ease of Living of the common man and to ensure stability in development, India requires Next Generation Infrastructure.
Special emphasis has been given to development of infrastructure related to Digital India.
The budget has ensured the following – remunerative price of crop to the farmer, upliftment of the poor with welfare schemes, respecting honesty of tax paying citizen, support to the spirit of entrepreneurs with a right tax structure and hailing the contribution of senior citizens to the country.
The agreement aims to establish the basis for a cooperative institutional relationship to encourage and promote technical bilateral cooperation on new and renewable issues on the basis of mutual benefit equality and reciprocity.
The Agreement envisages establishing a Joint Committee to develop Work Plans in order to implement the Agreement.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal for ratification of Minamata Convention on Mercury and depositing the instrument of ratification enabling India to become a Party of the Convention.
The approval entails Ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury along with flexibility for continued use of mercury-based products and processes involving mercury compound up to 2025.
The Minamata Convention on Mercury will be implemented in the context of sustainable development with the objective to protect human health and environment from the anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds.
The Convention protects the most vulnerable from the harmful effects of mercury and also protects the developmental space of developing countries.
Therefore, the interest of the poor and vulnerable groups will be protected.
The Minamata Convention on Mercury will further urge enterprises to move to mercury-free alternatives in products and non-mercury technologies in manufacturing processes.
This will drive research & development, and promote innovation.

Development of UCG is envisaged to provide for energy security.
An Inter-Ministerial Committee under the Ministry of Coal with members from concerned Ministries will be responsible for identification of the areas, deciding about blocks to be put to bidding or awarding them to PSUs on nomination basis.
Ministry of Coal may engage a consultant for development of the contract document.
For development of bid documents, work programme, conducting the bidding process, evaluation of bids, monitoring and process protocols etc., Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL) will be the nodal agency.
In the perspective of next two years some explored blocks will be identified for offer.

In a couple of hours from now, I would meet the E.U. leadership for the 13th India-E.U. Summit.
For India, E.U. is one of our strongest strategic partners.
Trade, Investment, and technology partnership between India and the E.U. would be one of the focus areas of our discussions.
I feel that a progressive path and creative mind-set to India-E.U Trade and Investment Agreement can enable all the European countries, including Belgium, to benefit from India’s strong economic growth.
I once again express my sincere gratitude to Prime Minister Charles Michel for his time, welcome and hospitality.

The Prime Minister mentioned that the Union Budget presentation is being advanced by about a month to ensure speedier implementation of projects and schemes.
He urged all States to align their plans with this advancement, so that they could take maximum advantage of this move.
On the upcoming occasion of Sardar Patel Jayanti, the Prime Minister urged all Secretaries and Chief Secretaries to work towards ensuring that at least one website out of the departments and organizations under them, is available in all officially recognized Indian languages.
Thank you, Shantanu, John, Satya, Paul, Sunder, and Venkatesh,
A big thank you!
I am sure this was not pre-arranged.
But, here on stage you see a perfect picture of India-U.S. partnership in the digital economy.
Good Evening, everyone!
If there was ever a gathering under one roof that could claim to be shaping the world, it is this.
And, I am not talking about those in public office, here or in India!
It’s a great pleasure to be here in California.
It is one of the last places in the world to see the sun set.
But, it is here that new ideas see the first light of the day.
It’s a great honour that you have joined us tonight.
I have met many of you in Delhi and New York, and on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
These are the new neighborhoods of our new world.
If Facebook were a country, it would be the third most populous one and the most connected.
Google today has made teachers less awe-inspiring and grandparents more idle.
Twitter has turned everyone into a reporter.
The traffic lights that need to work the best are on CISCO routers.
The status that now matters is not whether you are awake or asleep, but whether you are online or offline.
The most fundamental debate for our youth is the choice between Android, iOS or Windows.
From computing to communication, entertainment to education, from printing documents to printing products, and, now to internet of things, it’s been a long journey in a short time.
In India, a mother in a distant hill village has a better chance to save her new born infant.
A child in a remote village has better access to education.
A small farmer is more confident about his land holding and getting better market price.
A fisherman on the sea has a better catch.
And, a young professional in San Francisco can Skype daily to comfort her sick grandmother in India.
An initiative by a father in Haryana for “Selfie with daughter” to draw attention to the girl child became an international movement.
All this is because of the work you people are doing.
By using Space technology and internet, we have been able to identify in the last few months 170 applications that will make governance better and development faster.
The pace at which people are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income.
I like recounting my meeting with a group of unlettered tribal women in a remote part of Gujarat.
They were present at a local milk chilling plant I was inaugurating.
They were using cell phones to take photographs of the event.
I asked them what they would do with the images.
The answer was a surprise for me.
They said,they would go back, have the images downloaded on to a computer and take printouts.
Yes, they were familiar with the language of our digital world.
And, farmers in Maharashtra State have created a Whatsapp group to share information on farming practices.
We will continue to see human struggles and successes.
We will witness human glory and tragedies.
But, in this digital age, we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago.
This is what sets us apart from the century that we have just left behind.
There may be still some who see the digital economy as the tool of the rich, educated and the privileged.
I see technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity.
Social media is reducing social barriers.
Technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses, not in 24 hours but in 24 minutes.
When you think of the exponential speed and scale of expansion of social media or a service, you have to believe that it is equally possible to rapidly transform the lives of those who have long stood on the margins of hope.
So, friends out of this conviction was born the vision of Digital India.
It is an enterprise for India’s transformation on a scale that is, perhaps, unmatched in human history.
We will transform governance, making it more transparent, accountable, accessible and participative.
I spoke of E-Governance as a foundation of better governance – efficient, economical and effective.
I now speak of M-Governance or mobile governance.
That is the way to go in a country with one billion cell phones and use of smart phones growing at high double digit rates.
It has the potential to make development a truly inclusive and comprehensive mass movement.
It puts governance within everyone’s reach.
After MyGov.in, I have just launched the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
They are helping me stay in close touch with people.
I learn a great deal from their suggestions and complaints.
We want to free our citizens from the burden of excessive paper documents in every office.
We want paperless transactions.
We have set up Ebiz portal to make approvals for businesses and citizens easy and efficient so that they concentrate their energy on their goals, not on government processes.
We are using technology to impart scale and speed to development.
Information, education, skills, healthcare, livelihood, financial inclusion, small and village enterprises, opportunities for women, conservation of natural resources, distributed clean energy – entirely new possibilities have emerged to change the development model.
But for all this, we must bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way that we seek to ensure general literacy.
We must ensure that technology is accessible, affordable, and adds value.
We want our 1.25 billion citizens to be digitally connected.
We already have broadband usage across India go up by 63% last year.
We need to accelerate this further.
We have launched an aggressive expansion of the National Optical Fibre Network that will take broadband to our 600,000 villages.
We will connect all schools and colleges with broadband.
Building I-ways are as important as highways.
We are expanding our public Wi-Fi hotspots.
For example, we want to ensure that free Wi Fi is not only there in airport lounges, but also on our railway platforms.
Teaming up with Google, we will cover 500 railway stations in a short time.
We are also setting up Common Service Centres in villages and towns.
We will also use information technology to build smart cities.
For me, access also means that content should be in local languages.
In a country with 22 official languages, it is a formidable, but an important task.
Affordability of products and services is critical for our success.
There are many dimensions to this.
We will promote manufacture of quality and affordable products in India.
That is part of our vision of Make in India, Digital India and Design in India.
As our economy and our lives get more wired, we are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security, intellectual property rights and cyber security.
And,I know to achieve the vision of Digital India, the government must also start thinking a bit like you.
So, from creating infrastructure to services, from manufacture of products to human resource development, from support governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy, Digital India is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you.
But, we also know that we will not reach new destinations without taking new roads.
Much of India that we dream of is yet to be built.
So, we have the opportunity to shape its path now.
And, we have the talent, enterprise and skills to succeed.
We also have the strength of the partnership between India and the United States.
Indians and Americans have worked together to shape the knowledge economy.
They have made us aware of the vast potential of technology.
From large corporate to young professionals in this great centre of innovation, each can be part of the Digital India story.
The sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be a major force of good for our world and our planet.
Today, we speak of India-U.S. partnership as a defining partnership of this century.
It hinges on two major reasons.
Both converge here in California.
We all know that the dynamic Asia Pacific Region will shape the course of this century.
And, India and the United States, the world’s two largest democracies, are located at the two ends of this region.
We have the responsibility to shape a future of peace, stability and prosperity in this region.
Even more, in this Digital Age, we can draw on the strength of our values and partnership to shape a better and more sustainable future for the world.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today congratulated Shri Harivansh, on his election as Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.
Speaking in the Upper House, shortly after the election, the Prime Minister also expressed happiness that the Leader of the House, Shri Arun Jaitley, is back in the House, after recovering from illness.
The Prime Minister noted that we are marking the anniversary of the Quit India Movement today.
He said that Harivansh ji hails from Ballia, a land which has been linked with the freedom struggle, right from the 1857 war of independence.
The Prime Minister added that Shri Harivansh has been inspired by Loknayak Jaya Prakash Narayan.
The Prime Minister recalled that Harivansh ji had also worked with former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar ji.

He thanked the Chairman and all the members, for the smooth conduct of the election.
The discussions focused on subjects such as increasing the share of gas in India’s energy mix, fresh investment in oil and gas exploration in India, regulatory frameworks, international acquisition of oil and gas assets, emerging areas such as shale gas and coal-bed methane, and the oil and gas sector related possibilities of “Make in India.”
The Prime Minister emphasized his vision for a fresh look at the sector, to bring in investment, technological upgradation, and development of human resource.

The MoU was signed on 22.6.2018.
The Traditional Systems of Medicine in India are well organized, codified and well documented comprised of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy.
These systems hold tremendous potential in the global health scenario.
I am also delighted to reciprocate President Michel’s exceptional hospitality in March, this year.
He has led his country with great vision.
He is a strong global voice of concern on climate change, especially for small island countries.
Excellency, just as we appreciate your country’s beauty, we admire your Nation’s progress.
President Michel has also been instrumental for the progress in our relationship.
We value this greatly because Seychelles is a key strategic partner for India.
Just as the range of our interests are broad, so are the foundations of our relationship deep – our shared values, ties of kinship, unmatched mutual respect and trust, and a partnership of equality.
I am pleased that we are making good progress on the decisions from my very productive visit in March.
President Michel’s visit has imparted additional momentum to our relations.
We have excellent security cooperation, especially for maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region.
We are honoured to be a partner in providing aircraft, naval vessels and coastal radar systems for strengthening surveillance capacities.
Our cooperation in hydrography surveys is extensive and growing.
I have conveyed that India will gift one more Interceptor Coastguard boat to Seychelles.
In March, I had announced that we would gift a second Dornier aircraft to Seychelles.
I am pleased that we have completed the process quickly and signed the agreement today.
President and I place strong emphasis on Ocean or Blue Economy.
I believe, as he does, that we should look at small island countries as large ocean states with vast potential.
We are pleased that sustainable use of oceans and marine resources is a distinct element in the Sustainable Development Goals in the United Nations that were finalised recently.
Our bilateral agreement for cooperation on blue economy is a huge step forward in our relationship and in promoting sustainable ocean economy in the region.
We look forward to cooperating in Space, including in the areas of managing land and marine resources, fisheries advisory, weather forecasting and disaster management.
We have begun preparations for infrastructure development on the Assumption Island in Seychelles.
We had spoken in March about improving connectivity.
The Air Services Agreement today will enable more and easier connections between the two countries.
Climate change is a major global challenge.
It is a serious threat to island countries like Seychelles.
With a shoreline of 7500 kilometres and nearly 1300 islands, India has similar concerns.
We both have ambitious National plans for a more sustainable future.
I shared our desire to press for reforms of the United Nations, including its Security Council, in this 70th anniversary year.
We greatly appreciate Seychelles’ support for India’s candidature for permanent membership of an expanded United Nations Security Council.
I also conveyed our desire to work with Small Island Developing States to realise their vision of Samoa Pathway and to be a source of strength for each other in international forums.
I thank President Michel for his support for the Third India-Africa Forum Summit to be held in October.
Let me also express our gratitude to Seychelles for their active support in making the International Day of Yoga a big success.
Excellency, we are two Nations of vastly different sizes.
I am confident that this milestone year for our relationship will be the springboard for taking our strategic partnership to a new level.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi praised the beauty of North East India and urged people to share their photos of their North East visits on Instagram using #MagnificentNortheast yesterday.
He promised that he will share his photos as well.
Today he has shared some of his photos of North East visits.
Yesterday, had requested you all to share pictures of your visits to the Northeast on Instagram using #MagnificentNortheast.
I shared some of the pictures in a Story on my page.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, visited the Facebook Headquarters in California.
The Prime Minister and CEO, Facebook Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, participated in a townhall Q&A session.
During the event, The Prime Minister answered questions on a diverse range of issues.
The Prime Minister responded to Mr. Mark Zuckerberg’s statement that Steve Jobs had asked him to visit a temple in India, to reconnect with his vision.
He said this was a unique link between science and spirituality.
He said that over the last 15 months, the world had changed its attitude of looking at India.
In response to a question on whether social media and the internet could become a tool for governance and citizen engagement, he said social media had enabled the Government to get real-time feedback on its actions.
He spoke of his engagement on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, and how he had tweeted greetings to the people of Israel, on the occasion of Hanukkah, in Hebrew, on Twitter, and how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had replied in Hindi.
The Prime Minister said this was a new dimension in diplomacy.
In a voice that choked repeatedly with emotion, the Prime Minister spoke of his parents, especially his mother, and how she had struggled to bring up her children.
He said that this story of struggle is not just of his mother alone, but many other mothers in India as well.
He spoke of his commitment to involve women in the decision making process of governance.
The Prime Minister visited the Google Headquarters, where he was received by Mr. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google.
He was given an overview of some of Google’s innovations and future plans.
Mr. Eric Schmidt and Mr. Larry Page were present.
During a demonstration of Google Streetview, the Prime Minister asked for Khagaul to be pinpointed on Google Earth.
Khagaul near Patna is where the great ancient astronomer Aryabhatta had an observatory.
Roundtable on Renewable Energy.
Dr. Ernest Moniz, Secretary of Energy, United States; and Prof. Steven Chu, former US Secretary of Energy were present at the roundtable meeting.
Top energy CEOs and investors, including Ahmad Chatila, CEO SunEdison; Nikesh Arora, President and COO, Softbank; K.R. Sridhar, CEO, Bloom Energy; Jonathan Wolfson, CEO, Solazyme; John Doerr, Venture Capitalist; and Ira Ehrenpreis of DBL partners were present.
Prof Arun Majumdar, Prof Roger Noll, Dr. Anjani Kochar, and Prof. Sally Benson, all from Stanford University, participated.
Among the views expressed at the roundtable, was a clear assertion that India has the makings of becoming the “clean energy world capital.”
The participants said that clean and renewable energy will soon be an inexpensive energy option, with electricity storage becoming cheaper.
Participants were of the view that States and Cities in India should be allowed to take the lead in clean energy initiatives.
A related thought was that the current grid is not designed for carrying the 175 GigaWatts (GW) of renewable energy that India is targeting, and therefore a complimentary effort is required on the grid side.
Private investment was emphasized as vital for realizing the vision of 175 GW, with a parallel example being given of how Israel had solved its water shortage using private investment.
The Prime Minister thanked the participants for their views, and emphasized India’s commitment to realize the vision of 175 GigaWatts of clean energy.
He said there is massive scope of investment in the sector, for example, through the Railways, where 100 percent FDI has been allowed.
He said the Government is working to address issues in regulation, and address the financial health of Discoms.
The Prime Minister also gave an overview of initiatives already undertaken in the area of renewable energy, such as Kochi Airport becoming a solar-powered airport, and solar panels being installed over a canal in Gujarat.
The Prime Minister addressed the Start-Up Konnect event, which was a platform for Indian Start-Ups to showcase their innovations.
He spoke of his vision for Start-Ups in India:
“The convergence of technology, integration across diverse fields, distributed architecture and people willing to back an idea, have opened a new world for enterprise.
This ecosystem was born in the Silicon Valley.
No community is shaping our world as much as the one on this Californian Coast.
That underlines America’s success and inspires the world.
So, I see Startups, technology and innovation as exciting and effective instruments for India’s transformation, and for creating jobs for our youth.
India’s own ecosystem of startups is evolving rapidly.
Address to Indian Community
The Prime Minister addressed the Indian diaspora at the SAP arena.
He spoke of the partnership between India and US, forged on the shared values of democracy and innovation.
He gave a broad overview of the work done by his Government over the last fifteen months.
The late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was the last person with a Parliamentary majority before you, described people’s expectations of him as “scary”.
At the end of one year, what is your impression of running the government?
From the potential I have seen in the country, I believe there is no logic in it staying poor and underdeveloped.
Countries that attained freedom much later have developed more than us; we too could have been there.
There is nothing lacking in the country.
I won’t go into where we went wrong or who did wrong.
Even the media that is usually critical of the government (which is natural and how it should be) has been furthering this particular campaign.
Such has been the awareness created today that children point out to their parents if they litter.
This has shown the real strength of the country.
Then I have seen the strength of the government machinery.
When I declared we’ll open bank accounts before January 26, everyone was shocked: this is something that has never happened in 60 years, what is this man saying!
But within around 100 days, before December 25, the targets were nearly met by all.
The government machinery and bank employees went to people’s homes.
This shows if given clear guidance and road map are given, government employees have the ability to deliver results.
What has been your main thrust in the first year, what did you want to do?
I was new for Delhi, Delhi was new for me, I had also not had much interaction with Delhi or its bureaucracy.
So to shed light to see how things were, I started with small trials to see if the system’s frequency matched mine or not.
And within three I months I found it matched perfectly.
That gave me a huge confidence.
So I combine self-discipline in personal life with a humane approach to others.
In all of this, my 13 years’ experience has been of tremendous use.
What is the difference you find between running a state, as you did in Gujarat, and running a nation?
Fundamentally there is no difference.
Ultimately, you have to run the administration, do human resource management.
But at the Centre there are certain new domains, such as defence or foreign affairs.
One issue is that in states you have an organic team, but at the Centre it is an assembled team that has come in from states for two or three years.
People keep taunting you with the question where are the ‘achhe din’?
What exactly do you mean by achhe din and have you delivered?
When visiting an ailing person, we say don’t worry, he’ll be well [“achha ho jayega”].
The word ‘achha’ [good] here is in the context of the ‘burra’ [bad] that the patient is going through.
So my idea of ‘achhe din’ is riddance of that bad.
And I believe we have achieved this.
It would have been good if these people had asked the Congress ‘gareebi hatao’ has been your slogan since 1970, has it happened?
The country was fed up with all of this.
And you have changed that in this one year?
There is no question of such things now.
What do you hear on coal auctions now?
Rs 3 lakh crore will come to the government’s coffers.
How did you bring about this ‘cleaning up of corruption’?
There has to be zero tolerance on this matter at the top.
Just my being honest is not enough.
It should be visible in my speech, conduct, manner, policy, tradition, everything.
I alone being ‘pure’ will not do.
The way to achieve this is to lay down a policy on everything in black and white.
The grey areas should be minimal, even if they can’t be zero.
Bureaucrats then have very little scope for discrimination; that in turn leaves no scope for corruption.
Are there going to be more measures to block corruption like this?
A cement sack was procured at Rs 360, now it is Rs 150 — though my figures may not be exact.
What about bringing back the black money that was promised?
First of all, none of those who have been in power thus far have any right to question my government on black money.
All this black money was generated because they took no measures to check it.
Despite directions from the Supreme Court, they did not constitute an SIT for three years.
This means people holding black money were given that period to cover their trails.
Had they acted the day the court gave the orders, the country would have gained billions of rupees.
To get black money back from abroad we need cooperation of countries around the world.
At the G20 Summit, I ensured an entry regarding cooperation on black money in the final resolution.
So can we expect all people hoarding black money will be caught and their names revealed?
I want to request a group of senior journalists to compile a list of all the criticism that has been there against my government.
This is the greatest achievement of this government.
An issue that concerns Punjab and Haryana particularly is farmer distress.
The charge is that the Centre did not move quickly enough when unseasonal rain damaged farmers’ crops and they were committing suicide.
Also why did you not visit the affected people?
Let us look at the record.
There had been a long-standing policy that compensation would be paid to farmers only if the damage was more than 50 per cent.
We brought that down to 33 per cent.
The compensation was increased by 50 per cent.
Earlier, damaged grain was not procured by government agencies.
These were decisions for which farmers had been crying for years.
As for my visiting farms, tell me if a Congress leader has visited a farm in the past 10 years.
Were there no farming calamities?
As chief minister I used to regularly visit farmers.
My job now was to collect information, take decisions, mobilise the machinery.
Now it is trying to amend it.
People allege it is anti-farmer and pro-corporate.
For 60 years they went with the old land acquisition laws.
Were they anti-farmer all this while?
Those who have forced 3 lakh farmers to commit suicide have no moral authority to complain now.
The earlier law was 120 years old.
For political interest they hurriedly brought in a law.
But later on they removed those from the draft.
After the NDA came to power, we realised there were certain points in the law that would have made the farmers’ situation worse if we did not bring in the ordinance.
Also, chief ministers of several states ruled by various parties came to demand changes in the law, including Kerala.
We could not have made it a point of ego to say that we won’t change the law just because we supported it in 2013.
Our intention is to amend only those provisions in the 2013 Act that militate against the process of growth and are against the interest of farmers.
The reforms in this Act will ensure greater irrigation potential, rural infrastructure, including electricity, schools and hospitals.
The debate should be on merit.
Are you confident of getting the Bill passed in Parliament?
This is not a matter of life or death for me.
And neither was it the agenda of my party or the government.
So I am trying my level best.
I am still prepared to accept any suggestions.
Do you plan a new deal for the farmers?
The farmer is the backbone of our nation; 60 per cent of the population is engaged in farm-related activities.
However, agriculture’s contribution to the GDP is only 15 per cent.
We need to modernise agriculture to improve productivity and quality.
What would you list as your major achievements in the past one year?
I can say with pride that there has not been a single instance of corruption.
Our mission and commitment is towards the country’s progress.
We have embarked on a path of transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in our policies.
Initiatives like the Jan Dhan Yojana, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Soil Health Card and the recently launched Social Security Schemes for the people at large are aimed at giving more income and security to the common man.
Emphasis on renewable energy is demonstration of the fact that we not only care about the present but also the future.
The recent Union Budget gave a boost of Rs 1 lakh crore to the infrastructure sector through public investment.
Pooling of gas for stalled power projects and fertiliser units shows our commitment to address the bottlenecks of the previous government.
We have taken up the task of construction of toilets in every school.
It is unfortunate that even after almost 68 years of Independence our schools did not have functional toilets.
New interventions on Ganga rejuvenation, skill development, mobile and broadband connectivity for all villages, and ‘Make in India’ is going to open new vistas of growth.
This is just a beginning.
On the economy, are you satisfied with the progress made so far with regard to inflation, jobs, growth in production, investment and exports?
The 10-year period of the previous government was characterised by high prices and spiralling inflation.
Our efforts on both the demand and supply side have ensured that inflation is under check.
It inflation is now well below 5 per cent.
Our efforts on economic front have been appreciated not only within the country but also by international organisations like IMF, World Bank and the OECD.
The foreign currency reserves are at an all-time high of US $35 billion.
This also shows tremendous confidence of foreign investors in our economy.
The GDP growth last year was 7.4 per cent.
In the current year India’s GDP growth is expected to be the highest amongst all major economies of the world.
We have taken more initiatives in this budget.
We have made substantial progress in rationalising our procedures and forms.
We are putting more and more approvals online.
We have also relaxed FDI in various sectors, especially insurance.
But people say you have been lucky with inflation, as oil prices went down substantially.
When I say I am lucky, people attack me, they don’t like it!
What is this?
Your call to “Make-in-India” is significant.
What has been the response?
The response to the initiative has been very significant not only within India but outside as well.
Wherever I travelled in the past one year, I met senior executives of industry in that country and they all were very excited about our “Make-in-India” plan.
We have laid emphasis on ease of doing business, making government more accountable, introducing technology in governance and reforms in all layers of government.
We have essentially taken the reform process to an entirely different level where both the Central and the state governments respond through a policy-based system and not by way of discretion or nepotism.
Similarly we are emphasising that the companies supplying defence equipment to us undertake to manufacture in India also.
On Defence, you went to France and made a bold decision to purchase 36 Rafael fighter aircraft.
People have questioned the rationale behind this step.
A good government has to strike the right balance between different priorities.
“Make in India” is very important for me.
So too is ensuring national security.
I will not compromise on either.
The purchase of Rafale aircraft was guided by the need to respond to the immediate operational requirements of the Air Force which was affecting our defence capability.
How can that be questioned?
In fact, the challenge is to break a logjam that we inherited from the previous government.
Some decision had to be taken.
We consulted all concerned and decided that we will have only a government-to-government deal.
There will be further discussions on this matter soon.
I would mention that during my recent visit to France, the senior leadership of their defence industry showed great enthusiasm for participating in our “Make in India” programme.
Do you think this way is going to be the future of defence procurement?
That will be decided case to case.
Will you deliver on the one-rank-one-pension (OROP) promise to the defence personnel?
The dialogue is being actively pursued.
There is no need to have any doubt on this.
For me this is not a political agenda.
Skill India is something you have championed.
How do you plan to make India the skill capital of the world?
The strategy is to upgrade and create new institutions to provide modern skills to our people.
The ministry in consultation with state governments is mapping the available skills in each district.
I am confident that with these efforts, we should be able to create a large pool of very skilled manpower that would act as a catalyst for our programme of “Make in India”.
It would also be available to other countries facing shortage of such skilled manpower.
Foreign policy has been a success area for you.
What is thrust of your foreign policy, what is the mission with which you went to all these nations?
First, I have travelled abroad no more than earlier prime ministers.
The media needs to bring out facts, and not create wrong perceptions.
Then you can look at the outcomes.
Thus far we have been a balancing power, always seeking others’ favour.
How long can we continue to do that?
Why don’t we grow into a global player?
It is clear in my mind we are no more just a balancing power, but a global player.
We speak on equal terms with all, whether it is the US or China.
Today we approach the world with greater self-assurance.
We have shown the confidence to engage all major powers simultaneously and effectively.
With our seven neighbours, our guiding principal is to have a humanitarian approach.
Even foreign policy ‘experts’ in the country have not noticed that our interaction with all these seven countries has been on humanitarian issues.
We helped the Maldives with drinking water; Sri Lanka pronounced the death sentence for five Indian fishermen, but we brought them back alive, when they (UPA) could not get one Sarabjit from Pakistan; in Afghanistan we rescued Father Prem who had been kidnapped by the Taliban.
In Nepal, we arrived immediately to do our duty as a neighbour.
From Yemen, we rescued people of 48 nationalities trapped amidst the fighting there; we saved some people from Pakistan, and Pakistan saved some of our people.
What about Iraq – Punjabis are still being held captive there.
In Iraq, we have saved so many people, including nurses.
You are visiting Bangladesh next week after resolving the border issue.
Will there be also a deal on the sharing of Teesta waters?
We had settled the long pending land boundary issues with Bangladesh by taking all parties into confidence.
The media has not realised this was a massive achievement and is talking of other issues.
Had this been elsewhere in the world this would have been cited as an example as big as the fall of the Berlin Wall.
The entire mood of our neighbourhood has changed dramatically because of our message of shared prosperity being implemented on the ground.
Mine is practical and outcome-based diplomacy.
Do you think India can sort out the border issue with China as we did with Bangladesh?
Let’s see where it takes us.
This is a very important relationship which has its complexities and challenges.
I am deeply committed to improving our ties.
President Xi expressed similar sentiments during his interactions with me.
Creating a more positive environment to expand our economic cooperation and address outstanding differences on the border is the immediate goal.
But the Chinese appear to be playing a dual game?
India must have confidence in itself.
World relations are not founded on suspicion.
You invited Nawaz Sharif for your swearing-in ceremony.
But after that relations have not moved forward?
Our effort at all times is to promote friendship with Pakistan.
All I can say is bombs do not help.
We have had done enough of fighting, there have been wars, terrorism, but that has not got us anywhere.
It is time we joined hands to fight poverty.
People on both sides will benefit.
With Pakistan, obviously we can only progress in an atmosphere free of terror.
They know that the basis of our engagement is the Simla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration.
If they take a step forward accordingly, I am willing to take two.
But there can be no compromise on our national security.
In J&K, your party has formed the government with the PDP.
That is historic.
Do you think the government will stabilise?
Will the issue of AFSPA be a hurdle?
There is a larger picture there.
We have to respect the mandate of the people.
It could either be an elected government or Governor’s rule.
The alliance in the state is one of the most important developments on the political scene.
It has the potential to resolve one of our most difficult national problems through people’s participation and good governance.
We need to understand that the two parties have varied views on some very important issues.
However, we have taken a pledge to work for the development of the state and its people.
Both the parties have come together on an agreed Common Minimum Programme.
It is now our duty to rise to the expectations of the people of the state and implement the Common Minimum Programme in letter and spirit and not digress from it.
And the demand on lifting AFSPA?
As I said, strictly follow whatever is agreed upon in the minimum programme.
You have strong development agenda.
But there are some leaders in the party and ministers in the government who speak out of turn.
There is a feeling that some of your own people are not respecting the moratorium on communal tension that you had called for on Independence Day.
How long would you flog one instance?
One minister said something inappropriate, he apologised in the House; the party as well as I condemned his statement.
Continuing to harp on these issues will not serve any purpose.
It is a country of 1.25 billion, you can’t ascribe to the government everything that someone mutters.
Tell me what crisis has been there in the country in the past one year.
So there is no reason for the minority communities to feel insecure?
In the second year, what can we expect from the government?
It will be development, development and development.

Indians from every corner of the country, Indians working in different sectors, present a grand view.
I’ve visited Oman nearly 10 years ago.
I was going to Africa as then chief minister of Gujarat and during that journey I had passed through Salala.
I was longing to visit Oman to meet all of you, to be amongst you.
Today, that opportunity has come.
Relations between India and Oman are hundreds of, thousands of years old.
You people would have also noticed as to what extent the interest of gulf countries in India has gone up along with India’s rising stature and progress.
Naturally, there is a new momentum in India’s historic relations with Oman.
His Majesty Sultan also has a distinguished relation with India.
Today, my presence in this stadium named after His Majesty Sultan to have an audience with you people in such a large numbers has a special importance.
This reflects that how much warmth His Majesty Sultan himself has shown for India and Indians.
We are extremely grateful to him for this special gesture.
We have been working to make the life of the common man of the country easier by following the formula of: Minimum Government – Maximum Governance.
We have included all these things in culture of the government: simplification of the processes; repealing unnecessary laws; reducing the size of forms in the government office from 40-50 pages to 4-5 pages; creating system for online filling of those forms; giving a sincere hearing to the grievances of the people and work on them.
In the changed India, now the poor people are not being insultingly turned back from the banks.
In the changed India, the government is coming home to provide the gas connection, to provide the electricity connection.
The poor people have been given life and safety insurance at a premium of 90 paise per day and one rupee per day.
An amount of Rs. 2,000 crore has been disbursed as the claim to poor people under these insurance schemes.

The country’s funds are saved when the decisions are taken with a clear conscience and as per a well laid out policy.
When the work is being carried out in an efficient manner, when the present resources are being utilised in the best possible manner then the country’s funds are saved.
I consider you people an important partner in the development of the country and in the nation building.
The impact of the solemn pledges made by you people for making a New India will also be seen in India.
Before each episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat, ’suggestions pour in Aakashvani, on NarendraModiApp, come through on MyGov, by the phone and come by the means of recorded messages from every corner of the country and people of every age group, And sometimes when I take the time to view them, for me it becomes an extremely pleasant experience.
These are suggestions that have emerged out of a certain squeeze of life’s experiences.
And therefore it is their natural desire that it gets a mention in ‘Mann Ki Baat’
According to me all of these things are extremely positive steps.
In the previous ‘Mann Ki Baat’, some people had suggested to me that food was being wasted; not only had I expressed my concern but mentioned it too.
Some time back, Shri Mr. Jagat Bhai from Gujarat, had sent his book, ‘Save the Sparrows’ in which he not only expressed concern about the continuously declining number of sparrows, but also what steps he has taken in a mission mode for the conservation of the sparrow which is very nicely described in that book.
Friends have you ever thought of travelling in a Second Class railway Compartment without a reservation, and going for atleast a 24 hours ride?
What great experience it will be?
You might not get to sleep and have to travel standing.
You’re able to ride a bicycle but have you ever tried to operate the three-wheeler cycle or rickshaw which transports people?
But before leaving for a particular place, preparing for the journey and upon reaching your destination gathering information about it like a seeker of knowledge, understanding about the place and having discussions with the local people, if you make an effort in this manner then the pleasure of visiting the particular place would be something else!
Do try to do it; of course do not travel too much in one go.
I know you do it, but have you ever wondered that you can earn using this very scheme?
The joy of a vacation coupled with income !
I read a line in a newspaper, ‘Every Indian is a VIP on the road’.

It is a great pleasure and privilege to join our military leaders again.
I am delighted that we are meeting at a base outside Delhi.
And, the passage to our future prosperity and security also lies on this ocean.
It also holds the key to the fortunes of the world.
This aircraft carrier is the instrument of our maritime power and a symbol of our maritime responsibility.
They defend our seas and protect our borders.
They keep our Nation secure and our citizens safe.
And, in calamity and conflicts, they do more than just bring relief and hope to our people.
They lift the spirit of the Nation and win the trust of the world.
In Chennai, you battled the fury of rain and the river to save lives.
In Nepal, you served with courage, humility and compassion.
And, as in Nepal, in Yemen’s conflict, you held out your hand to every human in distress, not just fellow citizens.
Our forces reflect our Nation’s diversity and its unity.
They embody the timeless culture of India and the finest tradition of our military.
And, their success comes from the leadership that you provide.
Today, I express our Nation’s gratitude to our military.
I pay homage to those who made the supreme sacrifice, in silence and service, so that India marches ahead.
Our thoughts are with the soldiers keeping vigil on the harshest frontiers of the world; with their families that say uncertain farewells when they leave home; and, their loved ones who must sometimes bear their coffins.
I know how an officer, in the prime of his youth, feels when he does not make the next grade, not because he was not outstanding or was less deserving, but because the room above was small.
So, to honour your service and uphold your welfare will always be our solemn duty.
For this reason, we have moved with speed to implement the One Rank One Pension promise that had remained unfulfilled for decades.
And, we will build the National War Memorial and Museum that you so richly deserve in the heart of our nation’s capital.
We will also improve skills and opportunities for our ex-servicemen, so that when they leave the Service, they can still serve the nation with pride and dignity.
I also pay tribute to our internal security forces.
I complement our negotiators for bringing new hope in the long standing Naga problem.
India is at an exciting moment of change.

We have become the fastest growing major economy in the world.
And, our economy is on a more stable path.
Our factories are humming with activity again.
We are building the next generation infrastructure at a higher pace and with an eye to the future.
Foreign Investments are rising sharply and so is India’s ranking as a place to do business in.
Every citizen can see a future of opportunities and fulfilled basic needs with confidence.
This is important for India’s prosperity, and also our security.
In an inter-dependent world, India’s transformation is closely linked with our international partnerships.
And, so is our security.
So, there is new intensity and purpose in our foreign policy.
In the East, we have strengthened our traditional partnerships with Japan, Korea and ASEAN.
We have made new openings in the region, including with Australia, Mongolia and Pacific Islands.
We have extended our reach in the Indian Ocean Region, and for the first time articulated a clear strategy for our maritime region.
We have raised our engagement with Africa to a new level.
We have retraced our ancient links to Central Asia.
We have established closer relations and security cooperation in West Asia and Gulf, even as we have revived our close relations with Iran.
Russia has always been a source of strength for us.
It remains important for our future, too.
With the United States, we have advanced our partnership in a comprehensive manner, including in defence.
Our strategic partnerships in Europe have deepened.
Across the world, India is seen not just as a new bright spot of the global economy.
It is also seen as an anchor for regional and global peace, security and stability.
And, as the world seeks to deal with rising threat of terrorism and radicalism, countries across all regions, including in the Islamic world, have reached out to seek cooperation with India.
Above all, it is our neighbourhood that is most critical for our future and for our place in the world.
But, ours is a difficult neighbourhood with the full spectrum of security challenges.
We see terrorism and ceasefire violations; reckless nuclear build up and threats; border transgressions; and, continuing military modernization and expansion.
The shadow of West Asian instability is becoming longer.
Beyond that, our region is marked by uncertain political transitions, weak institutions and internal conflicts.
And, major powers have also increased their engagement in our land and maritime neighbourhood.
From Maldives and Sri Lanka in the seas to Nepal and Bhutan in the mountains, we are working to safeguard our interests and our relationships.
The Land Boundary Agreement has boosted our growing relationship and security cooperation with Bangladesh.
We are engaging Pakistan to try and turn the course of history, bring an end to terrorism, build peaceful relations, advance cooperation and promote stability and prosperity in our region.
There are many challenges and barriers on the path.
But, the effort is worth it, because the peace dividends are huge and the future of our children is at stake.
So, we will test their intentions to define the path ahead.
For this, we have started a new NSA-level dialogue to bring security experts face to face with each other.
But, we will never drop our guard on security and we will continue to judge progress on their commitments on terrorism.
We remain committed to help the great Afghan people build a united, peaceful, prosperous and democratic nation.
We are also pursuing closer relations with China to harness the full potential of our economic partnership.
We will aim to address outstanding issues, maintain stability on the border, and develop greater mutual understanding and trust in our overlapping neighbourhood.
I believe that India and China can engage constructively across the complexity of their relationship as two self-assured and confident nations, aware of their interests and responsibilities.
We will continue to strengthen our defence capabilities and infrastructure, engage our neighbours more closely and strengthen our regional and global partnerships, including in maritime security.
In a world of rapid changes, India faces familiar threats and new ones.
Our challenges cover land, sea and air at the same time.
It includes the full range, from terrorism to conventional threat to a nuclear environment.
Our responsibilities are no longer confined to our borders and coastlines.
They extend to our interests and citizens, spread across a world of widespread and unpredictable risks.
As our world gets transformed, the character of economies change and technology evolves, the nature of conflicts and the objectives of war will also change.
We know that old rivalries can play out in new theatres such as space and cyber.
And, new technologies offer us new ways to be more effective against both traditional and new challenges.
So, we in India must be ready for the present and prepare for the future.
India is confident that our defence forces are prepared to deter and defeat any misadventure.
Our strategic deterrence is robust and reliable, in accordance with our nuclear doctrine, and our political will is clear.
We have speeded up the process of defence procurements.
We have approved many long pending acquisitions.
We are taking firm steps to address shortages and cater for replacements.
We are advancing the pace of expansion of border infrastructure and improve the mobility of our forces and equipment.
This includes the strategic railways to the border region.
We are transforming defence manufacturing in India through radically new policies and initiatives.
Our public sector is gearing up to the challenge.
The private sector has responded with great enthusiasm.
And, foreign defence companies are coming here with ambitious new proposals for Make in India, from fighter jets and helicopters to transport aircraft and UAVs; from avionics to advanced material.
We can never call ourselves a secure nation and a strong military power unless we develop domestic capabilities.
This will also reduce capital costs and inventories.
In addition, it will be a huge catalyst for industry, employment and economic growth in India.
We will soon reform our procurement policies and process.
And, our offsets policy will become a strategic tool for improving our capabilities in defence technologies.
Defence technology will now be a national endeavour that taps the potential of all institutions in our country.
Armed Forces will be crucial to the success of Make in India Mission.
I am encouraged by your localization plans, especially in the capital intensive Navy and Air Force.
Above all, we look to our Armed Forces to prepare for the future.
And, it cannot be achieved by doing more of the same, or preparing perspective plans based on outdated doctrines and disconnected from financial realities.
We must define our aims and our instruments for the changing world.
At a time when major powers are reducing their forces and rely more on technology, we are still constantly seeking to expand the size of our forces.
Modernisation and expansion of forces at the same time is a difficult and unnecessary goal.
We need forces that are agile, mobile and driven by technology, not just human valour.
We must re-examine our assumptions that keep massive funds locked up in inventories.
As our security horizons and responsibilities extend beyond our shores and borders, we must prepare our forces for range and mobility.
We must fully incorporate the power of digital networks and space assets into our capabilities.
Equally, we must be prepared to defend them, for they will be the first targets of our adversaries.
And, Networks must be seamless and integrated across agencies and forces, and are precise, clear and quick in response.
We have been slow to reform the structures of our Armed Forces.
We should shorten the tooth-to-tail ratio.
And, we should promote jointness across every level of our Armed Forces.
We wear different colours, but we serve the same cause and bear the same flag.
Jointness at the top is a need that is long overdue.
Senior military leaders must have experience of tri-service commands, experience in technology-driven environment and exposure to the full spectrum of challenges – from terrorism to strategic.
We need military commanders who not only lead brilliantly in the field, but are also thought leaders who guide our forces and security systems into the future.
We should learn from the experience of the others, but we must frame our systems and commands on our own genius.
Our National Defence University will be a reality soon.
We also need reforms in senior defence management.
It is sad that many defence reform measures proposed in the past have not been implemented.
This is an area of priority for me.
In conclusion, to transform our country, every institution must reform itself.
Our Nation will progress when we all move forward in step.
And, we expect you to lead from the front in expenditure reforms or in clean energy and energy efficiency.
As you reform, we will do our best to meet your needs and keep you prepared.
As our economy grows, we will be able to secure ourselves better.
This is also a year when humanity has come together in the United Nations to combat poverty and climate change.
In the memories of the great tragedies of the past and in our united efforts for a better world, we are reminded of the enduring human story of progress and peril.
And, of the responsibilities that men and women in uniform bear.
To serve the cause of peace.
And, you will help India rise to its promise and its place in the world.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
A very warm welcome to all the delegates from across the world to the Partners’ Forum, 2018.
From bigger budgets to better out-comes, and from mind-set change to monitoring, there is lots to be done.
The India story is one of hope.Hope that road-blocks can be over-come.
I am pleased to note that Latin America and Caribbean region and India will be show-casing adaptations of the global strategy during the course of this Forum.
I hope that these adaptations will inspire other countries and regions to develop similar strategies.
I firmly believe that a nation prospers when its people and importantly the women, and childrenare educated; and are able to live independent, empowered and healthy lives.
This has provided 800 million health screening check-ups, and free referral treatment to 20 million children, in the last four years.
One thing that constantly worried us was the high out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by families to avail medical care.
We therefore launched the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.
Ayushman Bharat has a two-fold strategy.
We plan to start 150 thousand such Health & Wellness Centres by 2022.
The other arm of Ayushman Bharat is the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
This provides cashless, health insurance cover up to 5 lakh rupees per family, per year, covering 500 million citizens who are most poor and vulnerable.
This number is almost equal to the population of Canada, Mexico and the US taken together.
I instructed my officials to identify 117 ‘Aspirational Districts’.
Each such district has been entrusted to a team that works across sectors like education, water and sanitation, rural development with top-most priority to health and nutrition.
Till 2015, more than half of Indian women did not have access to clean fuel for cooking.
We all know the saying: If you educate a man, you educate an individual; but if you educate a woman you educate an entire family.
We have also introduced Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana, that is expected to benefit more than 50 million Pregnant Women and lactating mothers.
This scheme enables direct benefit transfer to their bank accounts to compensate for wage loss, enable better nutrition and adequate rest before and after delivery.
Women, children and youth will continue to remain at the heart of every policy, programme or initiative.
I would like to stress on the need for multi-stake-holder partnerships for achieving success.
In all our endeavours, we are aware that effective healthcare, especially for womenand children, is best organized through convergent action.
I have been given to understand that over the next two days this Forum will discuss12 success stories from all over the world.
Let us join our hands together as an expression of our commitment towards this noble cause.

The Multi-Modal Logistics Park will establish Jharsuguda as a prime logistics hub in Odisha and boost ease of doing business in the State.
The 15 km Balangir-Bichupali New Railway Line would connect coastal Odisha with western Odisha synchronising development across the State.
It will reduce travel time from Bhubaneswar and Puri to major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai.
The line would benefit many MSME and cottage industries in Odisha and open up opportunities for the mining sector in Odisha.
During the visit, the PM is likely to launch the following development projects –
The doubling of line will give a boost to industrial capacity in Odisha.

This is a time of slowdown in the global economy.
Developed countries and emerging markets are both facing slow growth.
Against this background, India is being seen as a bright spot.
Growth is projected to remain among the highest in the world.
India’s place as the fastest growing large economy has not come about by accident.
To see how far we have travelled, we should look back to 2012-13.
The fiscal deficit had reached alarming levels.
The currency was falling sharply.
Inflation was high.
The current account deficit was rising.
Confidence was low and foreign investors were turning away from India.
India was considered the weakest of the BRICS nations.
In less than 3 years, this government has transformed the economy.
We have cut the fiscal deficit target every year and also achieved it every year.
The current account deficit is low.
Even after the redemption of loans taken under the special currency swap in 2013, foreign exchange reserves are high.
Inflation is low, running at less than 4 per cent compared to double digit inflation under the previous government.
Public investment has increased largely, even while the overall fiscal deficit has been cut.
A new monetary policy framework has been introduced by law with an inflation target.
The Constitutional Amendment on Goods and Services Tax had remained pending for years.
It has been passed and the long awaited GST will soon be a reality.
We have made progress on improving the ease of doing business.
As a result of all these policies, Foreign Direct Investment has reached record levels.
By claiming that demonetisation has stopped a fast moving car, our critics too have acknowledged the speed of our progress.
Financial markets can play an important role in the modern economy.
They help in mobilizing savings.
They channel the savings towards productive investments.
However, history has shown that financial markets can also do damage, if not properly regulated.
It is to ensure good regulation that the Securities and Exchange Board of India, – SEBI – was established by the Government.
SEBI also has a role to promote the development of healthy securities markets.
Recently, the Forward Markets Commission has been abolished.
SEBI has been given the task of regulating commodity derivatives also.
This is a big challenge.
In the commodity markets, the spot market is not regulated by SEBI.
Agricultural markets are regulated by states.
And many commodities are purchased directly by the poor and the needy, not by investors.
Hence the economic and social impact of commodity derivatives is more sensitive.
For financial markets to function successfully, participants need to be well informed.
I am happy to note that the National Institute of Securities Markets is performing the role of educating various participants and providing skill certification.
Today, our mission has to be a `Skilled India’.
Indian youth should be able to compete with their counterparts in any corner of the world.
This institute has a vital role to play in such capacity building.
More than 5 lakh candidates have been certified by NISM till date.
India has earned a good name for its well-regulated securities markets.
The spread of electronic means of trading and the use of depositories have made our markets more transparent.
SEBI as an institution can also take pride in this.
However, there is still a long way to go for our securities and commodity markets.
As you know, my government is very keen to encourage start-ups.
Stock markets are essential for the start-up ecosystem.
However, it is not enough if the securities markets are considered as successful by international investors or financial experts.
Wealth creation is good, but for me that is not the main purpose.
• to the improvement of all sectors and
• to the welfare of the vast majority of citizens.
So, before I can consider financial markets to be fully successful, they have to meet three challenges.
Firstly, the primary aim of our stock market should be to help in raising capital for productive purposes.
Derivatives have a use in managing risk.
But many people feel derivatives are dominating the markets and the tail is wagging the dog.
We should ponder as to how well the capital market is performing its main function of providing capital.
Our markets should show that they are able to successfully raise capital for projects benefiting the vast majority of our population.
In particular, I am referring to infrastructure.
Today, most of our infrastructure projects are financed by the Government or through banks.
The use of capital markets for financing infrastructure is rare.
For infrastructure projects to be viable, it is very important that the borrowing should be of long duration.
It is said that we do not have a liquid long term bond market.
Various reasons are given for this.
My call to you is to find ways to enable the capital markets to provide long term capital for infrastructure.
We must move away from that.
Bond markets must become a source of long term infrastructure finance.
You are all aware of the huge capital requirements for improving urban infrastructure.
This government has launched an ambitious Smart Cities programme.
In this context, I am disappointed that even now, we do not have a municipal bond market.
There will be problems and difficulties in creating such a market.
But the true test of an expert innovation is when it solves a complex problem.
Can SEBI and the Department of Economic Affairs ensure that at least 10 cities in India issue municipal bonds within one year?
Secondly, the markets must provide benefits to the largest section of our society — namely our farmers.
The true measure of success is the impact in villages, not the impact in Dalal Street or Lutyens’ Delhi.
By that yardstick, we have a long way to go.
Our stock markets need to raise capital in innovative ways for projects in agriculture.
Our commodity markets must become useful to our farmers, not just avenues for speculation.
People say that derivatives can be used by farmers for reducing their risks.
But in practice, hardly any farmer in India uses derivatives.
That is the fact.
Unless and until we make the commodity markets directly useful to farmers, they are just a costly ornament in our economy, not a useful tool.
This Government has introduced e-NAM – the electronic National Agricultural Market.
SEBI should work for closer linkage between spot markets like e-NAM and derivatives markets to benefit farmers.
Thirdly, those who profit from financial markets must make a fair contribution to nation-building through taxes.
For various reasons, the contribution of tax from those who make money on the markets has been low.
To some extent, it may be due to illegal activities and fraud.
To stop this, SEBI has to be extremely vigilant.
To some extent, the low contribution of taxes may also be due to the structure of our tax laws.
Low or zero tax rate is given to certain types of financial income.
I call upon you to think about the contribution of market participants to the exchequer.
We should consider methods for increasing it in a fair, efficient and transparent way.
Earlier, there was a feeling that some investors were getting an unfair deal by using certain tax treaties.
As you know, those treaties have been amended by this government.
Now it is time to re-think and come up with a good design which is simple and transparent, but also fair and progressive.
I know that financial markets attach a lot of importance to the budget.
The budget cycle has an effect on the real economy.
In our existing budget calendar, the authorization of expenditure comes with the onset of the monsoon.
Government programmes are not active in the productive pre-monsoon months.
Hence, this year, we are advancing the date of the budget so that expenditure is authorized by the time the new financial year begins.
This will improve productivity and output.
My aim is to make India a developed country in one generation.
India cannot become a developed country without world class securities and commodity markets.
I wish the NISM all success.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has wished the very best to the athletes representing India at the Rio 2016 Paralympics, starting from 7th September.

My meeting with the Prime Minister aims to expand trade, investment and high technology partnership with this important E.U. member.
Along with Prime Minister Charles Michel, I would remote activate the India-Belgium ARIES (Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences) Telescope.
The European Union is a vital trading partner and the biggest export destination for India.
This Summit will advance our multifaceted engagement across a whole range of domains.
In Brussels, I would also be meeting with the Members of European Parliament (MEPs), Indologists, Belgian CEOs as well as a wide cross section of the Indian diaspora in Belgium.
I would also interact with the Board Members of the Association of Diamond Traders in Belgium.
The same evening, I will address a Community Programme and interact with the Indian community.
I also look forward to my interaction with the scientists associated with LIGO project.
On 2nd and 3rd April, at the invitation of H.M. King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, I will be visiting Saudi Arabia.
India’s ties with Saudi Arabia are special.
Robust people-to-people ties constitute a key component of our engagement.
I plan to work with the Saudi leadership to expand and deepen our bilateral relations.
Discussions on the regional situation would also be on the agenda.
Our economic ties are also expanding.
Saudi Arabia is India’s 4th largest trading partner, and is also India’s largest crude oil supplier.
The global economic growth remains weak, with slowdown in several major economies, volatile financial markets and competitive devaluation of currencies.
I congratulate the Turkish Presidency for coordinating efforts on Growth and Investment strategies and Employment Plans.
We must all now implement our commitments.
Multilateral Development Banks should enlarge their capital base to support infrastructure needs of the developing countries.
New institutions such as the New Development Bank are welcome additional sources of financing.
There is global consensus on the need to address climate change.
However, multilateral institutions should not impose such difficult safeguards and conditions on loans that they become barriers to development in many countries and undermine sustainable development.
We welcome the G20 focus on employment of women and, on youth this year.
We have reduced inflation and current account and fiscal deficits.
Our programmes of inclusive development, including Financial Inclusion, universal access to basic needs by target year, Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, Industrial Corridors and Smart Cities will boost growth and, employment in India.
This will be a source of strength for the global economy.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, interacted informally this evening with Trade Ministers from Africa.
The Ministers are currently in New Delhi, for the 4th India-Africa Trade Ministers’ Meeting which was held in New Delhi earlier today.
Minister of State for Commerce and Industry (Independent Charge), Smt.
Welcome friends,
It will be focused on the issues pertaining to the welfare of the poor.
We are hopeful of a breakthrough in the GST.
One of the reasons for our optimism is that all the states have cooperated in a positive manner.
All the political parties have also been extremely positive and cooperative in their response.
We have been able to move forward in this direction after arriving at a consensus on certain decisions subsequent to detailed discussion on this issue in a democratic manner.
The efforts are on to enlist the co-operation of all to ensure that GST is in place by this session.
I am extremely thankful to all of you once again.
The financial outlay for this purpose is Rs 14,832 crore.
Under this scheme, new AIIMS are established and Government medical colleges are upgraded.
The PMSSY, a Central Sector Scheme, aims at correcting the imbalances in the availability of affordable tertiary healthcare facilities in different parts of the country in general, and augmenting facilities for quality medical education in the under-served States in particular.
Setting up of new AIIMS would not only transform health education and training but also address the shortfall of health care professionals in the region.
Setting up new AIIMS in various states will lead to employment generation for nearly 3000 people in various faculty & non-faculty posts in each of the AIIMS.
Further, indirect employment generation will take place due to facilities & services like shopping centre, canteens, etc. coming in the vicinity of new AIIMS.
PMSSY has two components –
Projects under PMSSY:
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the establishment of “Fund of Funds for Startups” (FFS) at Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) for contribution to various Alternative Investment Funds (AIF), registered with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) which would extend funding support to Startups.
The Fund is expected to generate employment for 18 lakh persons on full deployment.
The expertise of SIDBI would be utilized to manage the day to day operations of the FFS.
The monitoring and review of performance would be linked to the implementation of the Start Up Action Plan to enable execution as per timelines and milestones.
Accelerating innovation driven entrepreneurship and business creation through Start-ups is crucial for large-scale employment generation.
This would encompass support at seed stage, early stage and growth stage.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has expressed sadness over the loss of lives due to the collapse ofan under-construction flyover in Varanasi.
“Extremely saddened by the loss of lives due to the collapse of an under-construction flyover in Varanasi.
The UP Government is monitoring the situation very closely and is working on the ground to assist the affected”, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has extended his greetings on the occasion of Navroz.
PM said, ” Navroz Mubarak to the Parsi community!
I pray that everyone’s dreams and aspirations are fulfilled.”
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today dedicated to the nation, Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited, a petrochemical complex, at Lepetkata, near Dibrugarh.
He also dedicated to the nation, the wax plant of Numaligarh Refineries Limited.
He said rapid industrial development of the country is necessary to create employment for India’s youth.
In this context, the Prime Minister mentioned his PRAGATI initiative, which he said is giving impetus to stalled projects worth lakhs of crore rupees.
In this context, he said the Union Government is paying special attention to the North-Eastern region by boosting infrastructure and connectivity.
The Prime Minister said that the initiatives of the Union Government, including MUDRA and Start-up India, were aimed at creating fresh opportunities for the youth.
He said employment opportunities have to be created not just in big cities but in smaller towns too.
He said the Union Government is working on the principle of cooperative federalism, and both the Centre and States have to work together for development.
Senior leaders of the Muslim community from across the country, including Syed Sultan-Ul-Hasan Chishti Misbahi (Sazzada Nashin, Ajmer Sharif), Hazrat Ghulam Yasin Sahib (Shahar Kazi, Varanasi), Sheikh Wasim Ashrafi (Imam Tanzeem, Mumbai), Er.
While expressing apprehensions about the trend of increased radicalisation and emerging threat of terrorism, the leaders underlined the need for greater unity and collective efforts to meet the challenge.
The leaders brought to the notice of Shri Narendra Modi, issues relating to properties of Muslim shrines, Masjids and Madrassas.
They also sought the support of the Government in providing better facilities to Muslim youth particularly in the field of education.
The Prime Minister gave a patient hearing to the delegation and assured them of his full support in meeting grievances of all sections of the Muslim society.
He emphasized the need of empowerment of the Muslim youth to enable them to play a larger role in nation building.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has congratulated Justice Dipak Misra on taking oath as the Chief Justice of India.
“I congratulate Justice Dipak Misra on taking oath as the Chief Justice of India.
I hope this opportunity, this visit of yours, will also provide you an occasion to return to India more often.
TIME: Thank you, we hope so as well.
Modi: For more than forty years now, I have had an opportunity and chance to travel all across India.
There would perhaps be more than 400 districts of India where I have spent a night.
That was a part which I was not aware of till I entered the government here.
The biggest challenge I think was that I was new to the Federal government structures.
But within a very short time I have bridged the gap through very focused and concentrated actions.
There is now a meeting of minds.
Because of that, within a very short period of time, we have been able to establish a smooth, seamless working mechanism within the Federal structure.
I wanted to change this thought process, the fundamental thought process as to how the Federal Government and the State governments perceive each other.
I wanted the Federal Government and the State Governments to work together for the country.
I basically wanted to bring about a complete change in the thinking that Federal government is a giver to the State government, and the State government is a recipient of the largesse from the Federal government.
And I think within a very short period of time, I have managed to achieve that objective to a very large extent.
I coined a term for that, which I call cooperative Federalism.
I took it actually a step further and called it cooperative competitive Federalism.
Essentially the concept is that it would encourage different State governments to compete with each other for the growth of the country.
Similarly, it was my experience after I entered the Federal government that different departments of the Government of India tend to work in silos.
Each department seems to work as a Government in itself.
My effort has been to ensure that these silos get broken down, that there is a collective thought process which is brought about in the Federal government.
And also it has invigorated the administrative system of the Federal government which looks at a problem in a collective manner rather than as individual silos.
Would “Make in India” for example mean that jobs from the US would come here?
So, the debate that we had on the service sector, would that not switch to manufacturing sector?
How should the US see you?
Modi: I am extremely grateful to President Obama for the thoughtful and generous manner in which he has described me.
What he has written in TIME magazine recently, I am also very grateful to him.
If I have to describe the India-US relationship in a single word, I will say we are natural allies.
What should the India-US relationship be, what India can do for the US, what the US can do for India, I think that is a rather limited point of view to take.
I think the way we should look at it is what India and the US can together do for the world.
That is the perspective in which we approach our relationship with the United States.
TIME: You have visited 16 countries already in this year.
Who would you say are your other natural allies?
Modi: I think this is an expected question from a journalistic point of view!
There are several countries of the world with which India has strategic partnerships.
There are several other countries with which we have a relationship that is comprehensive in some other respects.
So I think it is important for us to see each relationship in an overall perspective and also how India approaches that relationship with each country.
If you look at the India-US relationship for example, the role that the Indian diaspora has played in the relationship is extremely crucial.
Also our worldview… in addition to our shared democratic values, there are convergences in our worldview on different situations in the world.
TIME: Prime Minister, you will be visiting China very soon.
China is increasingly assertive and influential on the world stage including in the South Asia region.
Do you think you can do business with China’s leaders?
Can India and China ever be friends?
Modi: After the India-China war in 1962, in the early 90s, India and China agreed on a framework for peace and tranquillity on the border.
Further, since nearly last three decades until this time that we have entered into the 21stcentury, there is by and large peace and tranquillity on the India-China border.
It is not a volatile border.
Not a single bullet has been fired for over a quarter of a century now.
This essentially goes to prove that both countries have learnt from history.
I firmly believe that there is not a single country in the world, whether its population is one million or much more, which would not want to increase its influence internationally.
I think it is a very natural tendency for the nations to increase their influence in the international space, as they pursue their international relations with different countries.
I firmly believe that with due regard to international rules and regulations, and with full respect for human values, I think with these two perspectives in mind each country has the right to increase its presence, its impact and influence internationally for the benefit of the global community.
TIME: I just wanted to ask a follow-up question.
On the eve of your visit to China, would you wish to send a special message to President Xi?
Would you like to say something to him on the eve of your visit?
That is the level of relationship that we currently have.
TIME: The US is gradually drawing down its forces in Afghanistan.
I am wondering whether you worry about the Taliban returning to power, and about the threat from ISIS and how you see that.
People talk of infrastructure development these days.
But if you go back in history, you’ll see that one of the former kings in the region Sher Shah Suri is the one who built the Kolkata-Kabul Grand Trunk Road.
The closeness of the India-Afghanistan relationship is not a new phenomenon.
It has existed since time immemorial.
And as a close friend, ever since India’s Independence, we have done and will continue to do whatever is required to be done to see Afghanistan grow and progress as a close friend.
We had a good meeting and extensive discussions.
We have in the past committed extensively to that.
In fact, India’s assistance to Afghanistan is close to about 2.2 billion dollars for reconstruction and development.
We have made further commitments to do whatever is required to be done for Afghanistan’s development.
And not only have we made commitments, we are also taking concrete and specific steps to implement those commitments.
I mentioned to him that the drawdown of troops is of course an independent decision of the American government, but in the interest of a stable government in Afghanistan, it would be important to hold consultations with the Afghan Government to understand their security needs as the US troops draw down.
And I did mention to him that we should all try to meet the security needs of Afghanistan post drawdown of American troops.
Rest of course is a decision that is for the US Government to take.
If you actually analyze the situation closely, what is needed perhaps is for the countries that believe in human values to come together and fight terrorism.
These individual groups or names will keep changing.
So it is important for the countries to go beyond the groups, beyond the individual names, beyond the geographical location they come from, beyond even looking at the victims of the terrorism, and fight terrorism as a unified force and as a collective.
I think that could be the first step for us to take.
At least it will clearly establish who you view as terrorist and who you do not view as terrorist.
The definitional aspects of terrorism will get addressed.
If you view terrorism in Syria from one perspective and terrorism outside Syria from another perspective, it can create problems.
If you view terrorism in categories such as good terrorism and bad terrorism, that too can create its own challenges.
Similarly, if you view Taliban as good Taliban or bad Taliban, that creates its own problems.
I believe that this can be easily done.
I think the other thing that we need to undertake as a focused measure is to delink terrorism from religion.
When I met President Obama both in September last year and in January this year, in September last year particularly, I did request him to lead the charge in delinking terrorism from religion.
I think if we are able to achieve this and if we go down this path, it would at least put an end to the emotional blackmailing which is inherent in this particular concept.
It would also help us additionally to isolate the terrorists completely who tend to use this interchange of arguments between terrorism and religion.
Where do they get their communication technology from?
Where do they get their financing from?
If we pass the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism and if we take the steps that I have just listed out, it will help the international community, help all of us to isolate those countries that stand in support of terrorism.
TIME: Prime Minister, you were mentioning about delinking terrorism from religion.
The other two groups that are creating a lot of headlines worldwide with their activities are Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab in Africa.
All of them claim to be doing what they are doing on behalf of Islam.
That is why when I framed my reply and I started my response, I basically prefaced it by saying that we have to look beyond individual groups.
I think terrorism is a thought process.
It is a thought process that is a great threat to the international community.
I am also not linking it to any particular religion or to the actions of religious leaders.
Sometimes that is obviously not very positive.
One was what the US and India can both do together in the world.
But one thing that the US is doing right now is trying to counter Russia’s influence in Ukraine.
Do you support international sanctions against Russia?
TIME: Another big international issue that is coming up is the Paris Climate Summit later this year.
Will India specify a peak for its emission, a cap on its emission?
So, please first ask forgiveness from the mother earth before you step on to it and cause it pain.
We also teach in our cultural history that the entire universe is a family.
For example, Indian bedtime stories – including school books – are quite replete with references to the Moon as maternal uncle and Sun as a grandfather.
So when we view these aspects purely from the perspective of a family, our association with Nature is much deeper and of a very different kind.
Insofar as the question specifically related to COP21 is concerned, I think if you look at the whole world, and the whole issue of climate change, if there is one part of the world which can provide natural leadership on this particular cause, it is this part of the world.
Insofar as my specific role and responsibility is concerned, I am acutely conscious and aware of that.
In fact, when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, my government was probably the fourth State government in the world to establish a Climate Change Department within my particular State.
And we closely linked its work to the growth policy that we adopted in the State.
In future too, in terms of initiatives that we are going to take, there is going to be a heavy focus on using energy that is environment friendly.
It is really an immense and huge initiative of my government.
River Ganges has a flow line of about 2,500 KM.
Roughly 40 per cent of India’s population is either directly or indirectly linked to this river.
It is not merely a Clean Ganga Initiative, not just cleaning of a river; it is actually a huge developmental initiative whose primary focus is to undertake development that is environment friendly.
Naturally, this reduces the environmental burden of agricultural cultivation within the country.
For the Himalayan region of India, I want to convert it into the organic cultivation capital for the entire world.
In India we provide to the households subsidized LPG gas cylinders for cooking.
Sometime ago, I requested the rich and the wealthy to give up their gas cylinder subsidy to free up the usage of the cooking gas cylinders.
Third, it will also reduce the health problems which are caused in poor families when they burn forest wood for cooking.
So, essentially we try to achieve all the three objectives – reduce carbon footprint, reduce forest degradation, yet improve the health of the poor families through this very simple environment friendly measure.
Another measure we have taken is to build Metro mass transportation facilities in 50 cities of India.
Similarly, in 500 cities of India, we have started elaborate waste water treatment and solid waste management plans.
The idea is to build these facilities through public private partnerships by using global competitive aspects.
I think the throw-away culture, the culture of disposables, causes a huge burden on the environment.
I think recycling, or the re-usage of the resources of the earth, is an important aspect which should be ingrained in our daily lifestyle.
President Obama said earlier this year that for India to succeed, it is critical that the nation does not splinter along religious lines.
What would you make from President Obama’s remarks?
Modi: India is a civilization with a history that is thousands of years old.
If you analyze the history of India carefully, you will probably not come across a single incident where India has attacked another country.
Similarly you will not find any references in our history where we have waged war based on ethnicity or religion.
Our philosophy of life, something that we have lived for thousands of years, is also reflected in our constitution.
Our constitution has not come out of any abstract insularity.
It essentially reflects our own civilizational ethos of equal respect for all religions.
As Indian scriptures say, “Truth is one but sages call it by different names”.
Similarly, Swami Vivekananda, when he travelled to Chicago for the World Congress of Religions, had said that respecting religions is not simply a question of universal tolerance; it is a question of believing that all religions are true.
So it is a positive approach and aspect that India and Indian civilization take towards religion.
If you look at one of the micro minorities of the world, the Parsi community, it has probably flourished the maximum in India.
One of our Chiefs of Army Staff has been from the Parsi community.
One of our biggest industrialists is from the Parsi community.
A Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was from this micro minority community.
So for us, the acceptance of all religions is in our blood, it is there in our civilization.
So, the underlying philosophy and the impulse of that particular motto is to take everybody together and move towards inclusive growth.
TIME: As we are heading to the US political campaign, a lot of America’s political leaders are talking about the role that their faith plays and their views of themselves as leaders.
Modi: Religion and faith are very personal matters.
So far as the government is concerned, there is only one holy book, which is the Constitution of India.
We also say ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam’ – the entire world is one family, and respect for all religions.
Those are the values I have grown up with.
Essentially the crux of Indian philosophy, the Hindu philosophy, is that all should be happy, all should be healthy, all should live life to the fullest.
It is not something that is specific to a particular religion, or to a particular sect.
And Hinduism is a religion with immense depth and vast diversity.
Modi: In so far the Bhartiya Janata Party and my government are concerned, we absolutely do not believe in this type of ideology.
And wherever an individual view might have been expressed with regard to a particular minority religion, we have immediately negated that.
For us, the unity and the integrity of the country are the top most priorities.
My Government will not tolerate or accept any discrimination based on caste, creed, and religion.
So there is no place for imaginary apprehensions with regard to the rights of the minorities in India.
TIME: Prime Minister, if I could go back to your election last year.
A key thing and the most important was the economy that was spoken about.
Modi: If you were to pick up the news papers for the period March-May 2014 last year and read them, you will actually get the context and key aspects of the context in which we were approaching the elections at that time.
One of which was that nothing seemed to be happening in the Government.
There seemed to be a complete policy paralysis at that time.
Two, corruption had spread throughout the system.
That was the context and the background in which I was elected.
My election, my government’s coming into power last year in 2014, should be viewed in the context of the developments over the last ten years in the country before May 2014.
You will actually see that, internationally, the whole world is, once again, excited and enthusiastic about India and the opportunities that India represents.
Another way to look at it is that, at the start of the 21st century, the term BRIC was coined to represent the four major emerging economies.
The assessment was that the BRIC countries will drive international economic growth.
Six-seven years before 2014, a view started emerging that ‘I’ in the BRIC had perhaps become less relevant or perhaps even a drag on the BRIC grouping.
In the last 10 months, the ‘I’ has reclaimed its position in the BRICS.
India is now one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
What we have done in the last one year is precisely as per that plan.
And in the next four years, we have step-by-step measures that would unfold as we go along.
Another example is increasing the Foreign Direct Investment cap in the field of insurance to 49%.
We ensured that it was passed by the parliament within the first year of our government.
India of course is a democracy.
You have a mandate in the Lower House of Parliament.
You do not have a majority in the Upper House.
Do you sometimes think that you would love to have President Xi’s power to push things through?
Modi: India by its very nature is a democracy.
In so far as different political parties of India are concerned, I firmly believe that they have the maturity and wisdom to make decisions that are in the best interests of the nation.
It is true that we do not have a majority in the Upper House.
Despite that, if you look at the productivity of the Parliament, it has actually been quite an achievement under our government.
Overall, it conveys a very positive message of legislative action.
In all, about 40 bills have been passed in the Parliament.
So if you were to ask me whether you need dictatorship to run India, no, you do not.
Whether you need a dictatorial thought to run the country, no, you do not.
Whether you need a powerful person who believes in concentrating power at one place, no you do not.
If anything is required to take India forward, it is an innate belief in democracy and democratic values.
I think that is what is needed and that is what we have.
If you were to ask me at a personal level to choose between democratic values on the one hand, and wealth, power, prosperity and fame on the other hand, I will very easily and without any doubt choose democracy and belief in democratic values.
TIME: One of the aspects, one of the pillars of a democracy is freedom of speech.
Earlier this year, the authorities in India banned a documentary about the terrible rape case that took place in December of 2012.
Do you think free speech should have some limits?
It has two or three aspects.
Three, it is also our responsibility to ensure protection of the victim.
If we had allowed such a thing to happen, in effect, we would have violated the dignity of the victim.
In so far as freedom of speech is concerned, as I mentioned earlier, there is absolutely no issue.
It is something that we greatly respect as an important aspect of our democratic values.
TIME: I wonder if I might ask one last question before we turn you over to Peter, who is very eager.
Modi: The question that you have asked actually touches my deepest core.
I was born in a very poor family.
I used to sell tea in a railway coach as a child.
I have seen poverty very closely.
I have lived in poverty.
As a child, my entire childhood was steeped in poverty.
I decided that I would not live for myself but would live for others and work for them.
My experience of growing up in poverty deeply impacted my childhood.
Till now, 25 nations have signed the Framework Agreement.
He thanked the various Members of the House, for adding vigour into the debate, and sharing insightful points
The opening remarks set the tone of his Government- “A government that works for the people of India, sensitive to people’s aspiration, honest, transparent, against corruption and for fast pace of development.”
PM said that India has seen remarkable progress in the last four years.
From foreign direct investment to steel sector, start-ups, milk and agriculture, aviation, India’s progress has been outstanding.
In 55 years, 12 crore gas connection were given.
Talking tough on corruption, PM said his Government is working tirelessly to bring the corrupt people to book.
On Benami Law, he said it was his government that implemented Benami Law and now people are getting caught for having the benami properties.
Speaking on Rafale, PM Modi said Defence Minister had answered to all the allegations in detail and the controversy was being created by those who think no defence deal can be done without kickbacks.
PM also said that about 20000 NGOs have shut their operations after the government sought details of their funding and these numbers may increase in future.
Explaining how the NDA Government has been working hard to ensure ease of living for all, he said the price rise has been checked as compared to the previous Governments.
Expressing his commitment towards a healthy India, PM said the prices of medicines and medical and surgical equipments have been brought down.
In the past four years, more than 6 lakh new professionals have joined the workforce and they have added to more number of jobs for the people.
He talked about how more than 1.80 crore people have been enrolled under Employees Provident Fund over between September 2017 to November 2018 , over a span of just 15 months , out of which 64% are below 28years age.
PM also told the LokSabha that more than 1.20 crore people have been registered under National Pension System or NPS.
Stating that India’s foreign policy has brought India to the fore in the global arena, PM said people hear what India has to say.
Lauding the role of generation next in charting the progress of India, he said “Those born in the 21st century are now going to be voters and thus, they will play a role in shaping India’s progress.”
PM summed it up saying that his Government will always fulfil the aspirations of the people of India.
Just a while ago we heard President Xi and Prime Minister May.
Here I am with my words.
Perhaps an overdose for some.
Or a problem of plenty for 24/7 News Channels.
It is a great privilege to speak to you at the inauguration of the second edition of the Raisina Dialogue.
Excellency Karzai Prime Minister Harper, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, it is a pleasure to see you in Delhi.
Also, a warm welcome to all the guests.
Over the next couple of days, you would hold numerous conversations on the state of the world around us.
You would debate its certainty and prevailing flux; its conflicts and risks; its successes and opportunities; its past behaviours and likely prognosis; and its potential black swans and the New Normals.
In May 2014, the people of India also ushered in a New Normal.
My fellow Indians spoke in one voice to entrust my government with a mandate for change.
Change not just of attitudes but of mindsets.
Change from a state of drift to one of purposeful actions.
Change to take bold decisions.
Every day at work, I draw on this sacred energy.
Every day at work, my ‘to do list’ is guided by the constant drive to reform and transform India, for prosperity and security of all Indians.
I am aware that India’s transformation is not separated from its external context.
Our economic growth; the welfare of our farmers; the employment opportunities for our youth; our access to capital, technology, markets and resources; And, security of our nation all of them are deeply impacted by developments in the world.
But, the reverse is also true.
Our desire to change our country has an indivisible link with the external world.
It is, therefore, only natural that India’s choices at home and our international priorities form part of a seamless continuum.
Firmly anchored in India’s transformational goals.
India is pursuing its transformation in unsettled times, which is equally the result of human progress and violent turmoil.
For multiple reasons and at multiple levels, the world is going through profound changes.
Globally connected societies, digital opportunities, technology shifts, knowledge boom and innovation are leading the march of humanity.
But, sluggish growth and economic volatility are also a sobering fact.
Physical borders may be less relevant in this age of bits and bytes.
But, walls within nations, a sentiment against trade and migration, and rising parochial and protectionist attitudes across the globe are also in stark evidence.
The result, Globalization gains are at risk and economic gains are no longer easy to come by.
Instability, violence, extremism, exclusion and transnational threats continue to proliferate in dangerous directions.
And, non-state actors are significant contributors to the spread of such challenges.
Institutions and architectures built for a different world, by a different world, are outdated.
Posing a barrier to effective multilateralism.
As the world begins to re-order itself a quarter century after the strategic clarity of the Cold War, the dust has not yet settled on what has replaced it.
But, a couple of things are clear.
And, we welcome it.
Because, it captures the reality of the rise of many nations.
Therefore, we need to guard against any instinct or inclination that promotes exclusion, especially in Asia.
The focus of this conference on Multilaterism with Multipolarity is thus timely.
We inhabit a strategically complex environment.
In the broad sweep of history, the changing world is not necessarily a new situation.
The crucial question is how do nations act in a situation where the frames of reference are shifting rapidly.
Our choices and actions are based on the strength of our national power.
Our actions and aspirations, capacities and human capital, democracy and demography,and strength and success. will continue to be an anchor for all round regional and global progress.
Our economic and political rise represents a regional and global opportunity of great significance.
It is a force for peace, a factor for stability and an engine for regional and global prosperity.
· Rebuilding connectivity, restoring bridges and rejoining India with our immediate and extended geographies.
· Shaping relationships networked with India’s economic priorities.
· Making India a human resource power to be reckoned with, by connecting our talented youth to global needs and opportunities.
· Building development partnerships that extend from the islands of the Indian Ocean and Pacific to the islands of the Caribbean and from the great continent of Africa to the Americas. · Creating Indian narratives on global challenges.
· Helping re-configure re-invigorate and rebuild global institutions and organizations. · Spreading the benefits of India’s civilizational legacies, including Yoga and Ayurveda, as a global good.
Transformation, therefore, is not just a domestic focus.
It encompasses our global agenda.
For me, Sab Ka Saath; Sab Ka Vikas is not just a vision for India.
It is a belief for the whole world.
And, it manifests itself several layers, multiple themes and different geographies.
Let me turn to those that are closest to us in terms of geography and shared interests.
A thriving well-connected and integrated neighbourhood is my dream.
In the last two and half years, we have partnered with almost all our neighbours to bring the region together.
Where necessary, we have shed the burdens of our past for the progressive future of our region.
The result of our efforts is there to see.
In the backdrop, our security engagement has deepened.
The completion of Afghanistan’s Parliament building and the India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam are two shining examples of our dedication to forge developmental partnership.
With Bangladesh, we have achieved greater convergence and political understanding, through connectivity and infrastructure projects, and significantly, the settlement of the land and maritime boundaries.
In Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives, our overall engagement in infrastructure, connectivity, energy and development projects is a source of progress and stability in the region.
My vision for our neighbourhood puts a premium on peaceful and harmonious ties with entire South Asia.
That vision had led me to invite leaders of all SAARC nations, including Pakistan, for my swearing in.
For this vision, I had also travelled to Lahore.
But, India alone cannot walk the path of peace.
It also has to be Pakistan’s journey to make.
Pakistan must walk away from terror if it wants to walk towards dialogue with India.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Further west, we have redefined, in a short span of time, and despite uncertainty and conflict, our partnerships with Gulf and West Asia, including Saudi Arabia, U.A.E, Qatar and Iran.
Next week, I will have the pleasure to host His Highness the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, as the Chief Guest at India’s Republic Day.
We have not just focused on changing the perception.
We have also changed the reality of our ties.
This has helped us protect and promote our security interests, nurture strong economic and energy ties and advance the material and social welfare of around 8 million Indians.
In Central Asia too, we have built our ties on the edifice of shared history and culture to unlock new vistas of prosperous partnership.
Our membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization provides a strong institutional link to our engagement with Central Asian nations.
We have invested in all round prosperity of our Central Asian brothers and sisters.
We have built a close engagement with the institutional structures in the region such as the East Asia Summit.
Our partnership with ASEAN and its member countries has served to enhance commerce, technology, investment, development, and security partnerships with the region.
It has also advanced our broad strategic interests and stability in the region.
In our engagement with China, as President Xi and I agreed, we have sought to tap the vast area of commercial and business opportunities in the relationship.
I see the development of India and China as an unprecedented opportunity, for our two countries and for the whole world.
At the same time, it is not unnatural for two large neighbouring powers to have some differences.
In the management of our relationship, and for peace and progress in the region, both our countries need to show sensitivity and respect for each other’s core concerns and interests.
Prevailing wisdom tells us that this century belongs to Asia.
The sharpest trajectory of change is happening in Asia.
There are large and vibrant pools of progress and prosperity that spread across the landscape of this region.
But, rising ambition and rivalries are generating visible stress points.
And, promote dialogue and predictable behavior rooted in international norms and respect for sovereignty.
In my conversation with President-elect Donald Trump, we agreed to keep building on these gains in our strategic partnership.
Russia is an abiding friend.
President Putin and I have held long conversations on the challenges that confront the world today.
Our trusted and strategic partnership, especially in the field of defence has deepened.
Our investments in new drivers of our relationship, and the emphasis on energy, trade, and S&T linkages are showing successful results.
We also enjoy a truly strategic partnership with Japan whose contours now stretch to all fields of economic activity.
Prime Minister Abe and I have spoken of our determination to intensify our cooperation further.
With Europe, we have a vision of strong partnership in India’s development, especially in knowledge industry and smart urbanization.
India has for decades been at the forefront of sharing our capacities and strengths with fellow developing countries.
With our brothers and sisters in Africa, we have further strengthened our ties in the last couple of years.
And, built meaningful development partnerships on the solid foundation of decades of traditional friendship and historical links.
Today, the footprint of our development partnership stretches all across the globe.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Our initiative of SAGAR – Security And Growth for All in the Region is not just limited to safe-guarding our mainland and islands.
It defines our efforts to deepen economic and security cooperation in our maritime relationships.
We know that convergence, cooperation, and collective action will advance economic activity and peace in our maritime region.
We also believe, that the primary responsibility for peace, prosperity and security in the Indian Ocean rests with those who live in this region.
Ours is not an exclusive approach.
And, we aim to bring countries together on the basis of respect for international law.
We believe that respecting Freedom of Navigation and adhering to international norms is essential for peace and economic growth in the larger and inter-linked marine geography of the Indo-Pacific.
In our choices and through our actions, we have sought to overcome barriers to our outreach to West and Central Asia, and eastwards to Asia-Pacific.
Two clear and successful examples of this are the tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan on Chabahar; and our commitment to bring on line the International North South Transport Corridor.
However, equally, connectivity in itself cannot override or undermine the sovereignty of other nations.
Only by respecting the sovereignty of countries involved, can regional connectivity corridors fulfill their promise and avoid differences and discord.
True to our traditions, we have shouldered the international burden of our commitments.
We have led assistance and relief efforts in times of disaster.
We were a credible first responder during the earthquake in Nepal, evacuation from Yemen and during humanitarian crises in the Maldives and Fiji.
We have also not hesitated in shouldering our responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.
We have increased collaboration on coastal surveillance, white shipping information and fighting non-traditional threats like piracy, smuggling and organized crime.
We have also shaped alternative narratives on long standing global challenges.
Our strong belief in delinking terrorism from religion, and rejecting artificial distinctions between good and bad terrorism, are now a global talking point.
And, those in our neighbourhood who support violence, encourage hatred, and export terror stand isolated and ignored.
On the other pressing challenge of global warming, we have moved into a leading role.
We have an ambitious agenda and an equally aggressive target to generate 175 giga watts from renewable energy.
And we have already made a good start.
We have shared our civilizational traditions to promote harmonious living with nature.
We also brought the international community together to create an International Solar Alliance, to harness the energy of sun to propel human growth.
A high point of our efforts has been the revival of international interest in the cultural and spiritual richness of India’s civilizational stream.
Today, Buddhism, yoga and Ayurveda are recognized as invaluable heritage of humanity as a whole.
Ladies & gentlemen,
Our task is cut out.
And, our vision is clear.
Our journey of transformation begins at home.
And, is strongly supported through our constructive and collaborative partnerships that span the globe.
With resolute steps at home, and expanding network of reliable friendships abroad, we will grasp the promise of a future that belongs to over a billion Indians.
And in this endeavor, you will find in India, my friends, a beacon of peace and progress, stability and success, and access and accommodation.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the establishment and operationalization of permanent campus of seven new Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) at Amritsar, Bodh Gaya, Nagpur, Sambalpur, Sirmaur, Vishakhapatnam and Jammu, and their recurring expenditure at a total cost of Rs 3775.42 crore (Rs 2999.96 crore asNon-Recurring and Rs 775.46 Crore as Recurring Expenditure).
These IIMs were established in the year 2015-16/2016-17.
These institutes are presently functioning from transit campuses.
IIM Amritsar
IIM Nagpur
IIM Vishakhapatnam
With this, all the 20 IIMs will have their own permanent campuses.
The IIMs will provide education to students to enable them to become professional managers.
The approval will promote economic and industrial development of the country.
As you are aware, this project took shape in the year 2007.
I was impressed by their understanding of the financial world, and also their contributions to their adopted countries.
Indians have a long tradition in mathematics.
India invented the concept of ‘zero’ and the ‘decimal system’ more than two thousand years ago.
It is no accident that Indians are now at the forefront of Information Technology and Finance, both areas of knowledge where zero plays a crucial role!
When the Gift city was conceptualised, I was Chief Minister of Gujarat.
Technological progress had accelerated manifold.
We had world class talent of Indian origin working in India and abroad.
I deliberated a lot with experts about how to make India, a thought leader, in the field of Finance.
It was clear that we would need to have the best facilities and the ability to transact in all markets in the world.
Gift city was born out of this vision.
Our aim was to provide world class facilities to India’s world class talent in finance and technology.
Today, with the inauguration of this Exchange, we have reached an important landmark in achieving that vision.
At that time, I had invited BSE to set up a world beating International Stock Exchange.
In the year 2015, during the Vibrant Gujarat event, they signed an MoU with Government of Gujarat.
Today, I am delighted to be here to inaugurate the new India International Exchange.
It is an important milestone not just for Gift city but for India, in creating 21st century infrastructure.
I am told this exchange will trade in equity, commodities, currencies and interest rate derivatives in the first phase.
Later, it will trade equity instruments of Indian and foreign companies.
I am told Masala bonds will also be available for trading here.
Many more companies from Asia, Africa and Europe should be able to raise funds from this important International Finance Centre.
The exchange, I am told, will work twenty two hours a day, starting when the Japanese markets start, and closing when US markets close.
I am sure, this exchange will set new standards for quality of service and speed of transactions across time zones.
It aims to provide onshore talent with an offshore technological and regulatory framework.
This is to enable Indian firms to compete on an equal footing with offshore financial centres.
Gift City IFSC will be able to provide facilities and regulations comparable to any other leading international finance centres in the world.
It is not easy to create an offshore-like environment in a large country like India with a huge domestic market.
India cannot be compared to small city states.
Such countries have very small local markets and hence can afford to have specially favourable tax and regulatory regimes.
Large countries cannot do the same.
There has been criticism for long that a lot of trading, even in Indian financial instruments, is currently taking place abroad.
It is said that India has stopped becoming the price setter for even some Indian financial instruments.
Gift city will be able to mitigate many of these criticisms.
But my vision for Gift City is larger.
My vision is that in ten years from now, Gift city should become the price setter for at least a few of the largest traded instruments in the world, whether in commodities, currencies, equities, interest rates or any other financial instrument.
India needs to create thirty crore new jobs over the next twenty years.
It is a huge endeavour.
The international exposure which our youth will be able to get from Gift city will ensure that more and more of them will be able to join this important field.
I urge Indian companies, exchanges and regulators, to help create a pool of experienced and world beating finance professionals.
They can work out of this great new city and provide services to the entire world.
Over next ten years, I expect this city to generate several lakh jobs.
You are aware of the importance I attach to the development of smart cities.
Gift city is the first ground up truly smart city in the country.
All the 100 smart cities will do well to understand how Gift city has been able to create its underground infrastructure which can compete with the best in the world.
I have said before that India can become a developed country in one generation.
New cities will be important in creating the new India of our dreams:
I hereby declare the India International Exchange open.
I wish Gift city and the India International Exchange the very best.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved MoU between the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, India and Mozambique.

The approval paves the way for applicability of Goods and Services Tax regime in the State of Jammu & Kashmir.
The decision comes in the wake of the increasing instances of cancer, limited cancer treatment facilities and the need for a hospital support to carry out further research in North Eastern Region.
The approximate non-recurring expenditure for strengthening of institute is estimated at Rs. 150 crore and annual recurring expenditure is estimated at Rs. 45- 50 crore.
Borooah Cancer Institute was established in 1974 in Guwahati with the aim and objective of investigation, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the North Eastern region of India by a voluntary organization.
Government of Assam took over the institute with all its assets and liabilities in 1986 and entered into a tripartite agreement with the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and North Eastern Council for management of the institute.
The institute is presently a 209 bedded hospital with 8 bedded ICU.
Tata Memorial hospital under DAE is a premier research institution in the field of cancer research and treatment.
TMC under the aegis of DAE has been extending financial and technical support to the institute since 1989.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed a large gathering at the swearing-in ceremony of the Council of Ministers of Assam.
He congratulated the people of Assam and said that in Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, they had a Chief Minister from the tribal community who is dedicated to serving society.
He expressed confidence that the new Government would serve the people of Assam and transform the State through development.
The Prime Minister said that the Union Government is working on the principle of cooperative federalism, and wants to give States maximum strength to enable them to progress.
He said democracy is about bhaagidaari (participation), and said the Centre and the States must walk shoulder to shoulder for development.
He stressed the need for comprehensive and all-round development of the Nation, and especially the eastern part of the country.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Hon’ble Prime Minister has today given its approval to Recommendations on Fiscal Deficit Targets and Additional Fiscal Deficit to States during Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) award period 2015-20 under the two flexibility options recommended in para 14.64 to 14.67 of its Report (volume – I).
FFC has adopted the fiscal deficit threshold limit of 3 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the States.
Further, FFC has provided a year-to-year flexibility for additional fiscal deficit to States.
FFC, taking into account the development needs and the current macro- economic requirement, provided additional headroom to a maximum of 0.5 per cent over and above the normal limit of 3 per cent in any given year to the States that have a favourable debt-GSDP ratio and interest payments-revenue receipts ratio in the previous two years.
However, the flexibility in availing the additional fiscal deficit will be available to State if there is no revenue deficit in the year in which borrowing limits are to be fixed and immediately preceding year.
Since the year 2015-16 is already over, the States will not get any benefit of additional borrowings for 2015-16.
However, the implications for the remaining period of FFC award, i.e., 2016-17 to 2019-20, would depend upon respective States’ eligibility based on the criteria prescribed by FFC.
For the year 2016-17, the following fiscal parameters need to be taken into account before determining states eligibility for additional borrowings of 0.5% of GSDP recommended by FFC: (Para 14.64 to 14.67 – Vol.
a) The revenue position of the State as per Finance Account for t-2 and as available from Revised Estimates for t-1.
To illustrate, for the year 2016-17, the revenue position of the State for 2014-15 (actual as per Finance Accounts) and 2015-16 (RE) would be relevant.
b) The IP/TRR ratio and Debt/GSDP ratio based on the data as contained in Finance Account for t-2.
To illustrate, for determining States’ eligibility for 2016-17, the IP/TRR ratio and Debt/GSDP ratio as disclosed in Finance Account of States for 2014-15 would be relevant.
There is no financial implication for Government of India as the borrowings are made by the respective State Governments within the fiscal deficit limits laid down by Finance Commission and incorporated in FRBMA of the States.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and the Federal Insurance Office, USA.
The MoU provides a framework for cooperation and coordination, including for the exchange of information and research assistance with respect to each Authority’s overview and other lawful responsibilities.
Under the agreement, both the countries intend to share their experiences on various regulatory functions and to provide mutual assistance including training activities.
India andUSA have also agreed to continue to facilitate cooperation on international standard-setting activities, financial stability and the development and implementation of consumer protection through sound prudential regulation of the insurance sector.
IRDAI is a body set up under the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999 to regulate, promote and ensure orderly growth of the insurance and re-insurance business in India.
Similarly, in USA, Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is vested with the authority to monitor all aspects of the insurance sector and to represent the USA on prudential aspects of international insurance.
India and USA have strong business relations with each other and both the countries have been in regular discussions at various political and official levels.
Various institutional mechanisms have also been put in place over time to strengthen bi-lateral cooperation on wide ranging multi-sectoral issues between the two countries.
USA is one of the major contributors of foreign direct investment in India and many insurance companies have set up joint venture with USA based insurance companies.
With increase in foreign investment cap to 49%, there is further scope for foreign investments in Indian insurance sector particularly from USA based companies.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has bowed to Swami Vivekananda, on his Jayanti.
“I bow to Swami Vivekananda on his Jayanti.
Today, on National Youth Day I salute the indomitable energy and enthusiasm of our youngsters, who are the builders of New India”, the Prime Minister said.

In his remarks on the occasion, the Prime Minister observed that people with such experience and capabilities, can never “retire” and should always continue to work in the field which interests them the most, for the benefit of the nation.
Implementation Strategy
Under the implementation strategy, the parties to the MoU will hold mutual consultations to structure the financial assistance, review the existing arrangements and related procedures.
EXIM Bank will identify viable projects in India.
For projects in third countries, both parties will jointly identify viable projects.
This amount may also be utilized by KEXIM as the financier without the participation of EXIM Bank subject to satisfaction of the purpose.
The Joint Statement issued in 2015 during the visit of the Prime Minister to the Republic of Korea stated that Korea intends to offer USD 10 billion of infrastructural development in India.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal of the Department of Health Research in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for setting up of a National Resource Facility for Bio-medical Research (NARF) at Genome Valley in Hyderabad by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).
The institution will be the first of its kind for quality laboratory animals for basic and applied biomedical research in the country.
It will be developed as a world-class facility for breeding and housing of animals such as primates, cabines and other specialized models such as transgenic and knockout rodents required for testing of various R&D products.
The facility will create, develop and provide access to a range of laboratory animals and related technological resources for advancement of biomedical research in the country, mainly to facilitate research in medical colleges, research and academic institutions, universities and Biotech/Bio-pharma companies.
The facility will also provide training facilities for personnel in the specialized areas in the field of biomedical research.
The State Government has allotted 102.69 acres of land at Genome Valley, Hyderabad, free of cost, to the ICMR for Establishment of National Animal Resource Facility (NARF) for Biomedical Research.
Ladies & Gentlemen,
1. I am delighted to be here again amidst such a large and distinguished gathering of political and business leaders.
Earlier today, I had the pleasure of meeting President Obama and we shared our thoughts on a wide range of issues concerning our two nations.
India’s bilateral relationship with the United States is stronger than ever and we both agreed that the future would be even brighter.
2. I am speaking to you at a time when the global economy continues to be weak.
Several parts of the world are still facing very difficult conditions.
This is a time when the world needs new engines of growth.
From the point of view of the world’s oldest democracy, obviously it would be nice if the new engines are democratic engines.
Obviously, India presents a large and growing market.
But India is much more than a market.
America remains at the forefront of scientific and technological innovation from Ø air traffic control to air quality improvement, Ø from drugs to drones, from hybrid cars to hydro fracking.
Indeed, to me, America is not just a country with a great past; it is a country with an exciting future.
I am therefore sure, that ours will be a partnership which sees both nations benefit.
5. A very unique feature of the Indo-American relationship is the critical role of the Indian-American community in the US economy.
It is rare that emigrants from one nation, who become immigrants in another, enjoy such high respect and repute in both countries.
Indian-Americans are a powerful cementing force in our growing economic and cultural ties.
6. I have just completed two years in office.
When I addressed you in 2014, I had just taken over the reins of government.
We faced a particularly challenging domestic and external environment.
Confidence of investors was at a low.
Doubts were being expressed about the future of the Indian economy.
The business community was unhappy with the inertia and stagnation that had set in.
There was frustration with archaic policies and red tape.
In 2 years, we have managed to overcome the odds and register an impressive economic performance.
7. I want to take this opportunity to describe to you the key elements of our policies.
I have said several times that my aim is to reform to transform.
For me, reforms are those policies that transform the lives of ordinary citizens.
In the last two years, we have taken a comprehensive package of reforms which go beyond more economic reforms.
I can classify them into four types.
9. Since we took office, inflation, the fiscal deficit and the balance of payments current account deficit have all fallen.
GDP growth, Foreign exchange reserves, stock market valuations, and investor confidence have all increased.
This success is the result of a series of well thought out policies.
We have legislated a monetary framework with inflation targeting and an independent monetary policy committee to curb inflation.
We embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation and our fiscal deficit has been reduced substantially in each of three budgets so far.
Even while cutting the fiscal deficit, we have greatly increased productive public investment.
10. This has been made possible in two ways.
Firstly, we imposed carbon taxes on fossil fuels.
We took the bold step of de-controlling diesel prices and thereby eliminated energy subsidies.
Secondly we have reduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods and use of technology.
Subsidies are increasingly credited directly to bank accounts of the deserving with fool proof biometric identification.
11. Let me now turn to our policies to stimulate growth and employment.
This audience is probably aware of the sweeping liberalization that we have undertaken in foreign direct investment.
We have put most sectors on automatic approval and opened up sectors like defence and railways to foreign investment.
The long pending insurance law reform was successfully passed.
Several insurance companies, including American companies, have already enhanced their investment in the insurance sector.
We have taken major steps to increase the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ and have already begun climbing steeply in the global rankings.
We are encouraging foreign and domestic investors to set up high quality and efficient manufacturing facilities.
We have greatly enhanced investment in roads, railways, ports and waterways to improve logistics.
We have made major process improvements in our ports to reduce the time taken for cargo to enter and exit.
We admire the start up eco-system in your country.
We are making a beginning in replicating it.
Our Start-Up India programme has stimulated a new breed of innovators.
In 2016, Bengaluru has become the fifth most preferred location for innovation centres.
It was not even in the top 10 in 2015.
12. For our economy to succeed, we need a strong banking system.
We inherited a system where cronyism and corruption were believed to be rampant in banking decisions and in appointments to public sector banks.
I held the first ever retreat of a Prime Minister with bankers.
We have set up clear performance measures and accountability mechanisms.
We are committed to ensuring adequate capital.
Interference in banking decisions has ended.
A new process for appointments has been put in place under a Bank Boards Bureau.
Credible and capable bankers have been appointed to head banks.
For the first time since banks were nationalized 47 years ago private sector professionals have been appointed in key positions.
13. I now turn to our policies to ensure that growth is inclusive.
We have brought two hundred million people into the banking system through the Jan Dhan Yojana.
This is more than the population of most countries in the world.
Now, these millions are part of our banking system, and words like ‘interest rate’ have a meaning for them.
These people have shown that there is great strength at the bottom of the pyramid.
14. The Jan Dhan Yojana has also transformed the ability of the poor to make and to receive electronic payments.
Every Jan Dhan account holder is eligible for a debit card.
We have introduced three non-subsidised but low cost schemes covering accident insurance, life insurance and pensions.
Because of their massive coverage the premia are low.
There are now over 120 million subscribers.
16. We have paid special attention to gender justice and to empowering women.
We have a new savings programme to help pay for girls’ education with a special high rate of interest.
To relieve rural women from the health hazards of cooking with firewood, we are giving 50 million new gas connections in poor rural areas.
Under our new self-employment financing programme (Mudra), over 70% of the beneficiaries are women.
More than 27 million new women-headed businesses have been assisted.
We have changed our policies to allow women in combat roles in the armed forces.
New rules are increasing the representation of women on corporate Boards of Directors.
17. Agriculture remains India’s mainstay in terms of providing livelihood.
There was a tendency to deprive farmers of subsidized fertilizer by diverting it for the production of chemicals.
A simple but very effective solution is neem-coating of fertilizer which makes it unsuitable for diversion.
We have moved towards universal neem-coating of urea.
It has already saved crores of rupees of diverted farm subsidies and improved fertilizer availability to farmers.
It is an example of how simple reforms can be very effective.
18. We have introduced a Soil Health Card nationally, which tells every farmer the condition of his or her soil.
It enables the farmer to choose the best crop and right quantity and mix of inputs.
This greatly reduces wastage of inputs and increases crop yield besides protecting the soil.
By reducing unnecessary chemical inputs, it is also good for health of consumers.
It reduces costs, increases yields, improves the environment and protects the health of consumers.
140 million soil health cards will be issued, requiring a collection of over twenty-five million soil samples, and tested through a nationwide network of nearly 1500 laboratories.
19. This brings me to an achievement that I think even our worst critics do not dispute.
This is the change in levels of corruption.
For many years, economists and other experts have held corruption to be one of the main constraints on the growth of any developing economy.
We have taken decisive steps to curb corruption.
I have already referred to what has been done in public sector banks.
We have revamped our personnel management to ensure that senior positions are held by persons of integrity.
We have launched an on-going campaign against tax evasion and black money.
The poor are the greatest beneficiaries of the reduction in corruption.
20. Looking to the future let me outline what I see as the path we will follow in the coming years.
21. Firstly, we will continue to have disciplined and prudent macro-economic policies.
I firmly believe that sound macro-economic fundamentals are a necessary foundation for long term sustainable growth.
22. Secondly, we will combine this with a continued stress on inclusion and equity.
This is to ensure the fruits of development accrue not to a few, not to many but to all Indians.
And this will also mean continuing our attack on corruption.
23. Thirdly, we will continue to make progress on improving the investment climate and Ease of Doing Business.
We want to make India a destination which not only welcomes business but where it is easy to do business.
We have largely achieved the first by drastically liberalizing our foreign direct investment policies.
We have made a good beginning on the second and will continue to make further improvements.
24. We will continue to strengthen the “Make in India” initiative.
I see this as a win-win proposition for the U.S. and for India.
India is the future human resource powerhouse of the world with a young hard-working population.
In my vision, a partnership between American capital and innovation, and Indian human resources and entrepreneurship can be very powerful.
I am convinced we can strengthen both our economies through such a partnership.
25. We will continue to make our tax policies more predictable.
We have made major strides towards predictability by signing a number of Advance Pricing Agreements with the United States.
We are committed to taking this further.
At the same time, like the U.S., we are cracking down on tax evasion and unfair tax avoidance.
26. We will continue to open up our defence sector.
I am aware that licensing policies can sometimes slow down the process of investing in India’s defence sector.
It is setting up a locomotive manufacturing plant in the relatively poor state of Bihar.
I expect many more such investments.
27. The river Ganga has a special significance for India.
A transformed India, with one sixth of humanity will mean a transformed world.
The journey will be long.
The heartening effect of the novel way in which our 1.25 billion countrymen dedicated this Diwali to soldiers of our army, to our defence forces, was clearly evident on their faces.
But when I see your support, when I look at your co-operation; although numerous efforts are on to misguide you, despite that, and despite witnessing some disturbing incidents, you have whole heartedly comprehended the path of righteousness and truth, you have favourably accepted this step taken in the best national interest.
The whole world is watching – will hundred and twenty-five crore Indians finally attain success after facing numerous hardships?
I distinctly remember, when the Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojana was launched, bank personnel earnestly and zealously shouldered their responsibilities and showed that they could achieve what had not been accomplished during the last 70 years.
Now, what they did when they received a 2000 rupee note as wages?
Four women from the neighborhood got together and jointly made purchases and made the payment with the 2000 Rupee note; they did not need small currency as they had jointly made their purchases and had decided that they would settle accounts later when they were to meet next week.
Thus there are big arrears of payments, which remain pending.
All municipalities receive hardly 50% of their tax revenues.
Imagine the difference – from 3 to 3.5 thousand crores to 13 thousand crores.
We want that under this new system you should have a bank account; your wages should be deposited directly into your bank so that payment of minimum wages is ensured.
We have now cancelled the online surcharge and you might have seen in the newspapers during last 2-4 days that all extra charges for such cards have been abolished in order to strengthen the movement towards achieving a ‘cashless society’.
But not only this, you must devote half an hour, one hour or two hours daily to educate at least 10 families about what this technology is, how this technology is to be used, how to download the Apps of your banks, how to spend money from one’s account, how to make payment to shopkeepers.
There are many countries in the world where the youth have changed the nation’s life and it has to be accepted that it is the youth which brings about the great changes, which creates revolutions.
It appears as if the subject of cleanliness has become so dear to him that even on his father’s birth anniversary he remembered the Cleanliness Mission.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today gave its ex-post facto approval for Memoranda of understanding (MoU) signed between India and various countries for cooperation in the field of agriculture and allied sectors.
The MoU will help in the nature of capacity building, knowledge exchange through visits of scientists and technicians, exchange of genetic resources that aidin development of appropriate technologies and farm practices for enhancing agriculture productivity at farmers’ field.
Expertise and technology so developed is applied all over the country as per felt needs.
Expenditure incurred on implementation of such MoU is managed within the “financial allocation made for the Department.
Under Transaction of Business Rules, 1961, cases involving negotiations with foreign countries on treaties, agreements and other important matters need to be brought before the Cabinet for approval.
Earlier, prior approval under Rule 12 of the above rules was obtained in certain cases and subsequent Cabinet approval could not be obtained.
Therefore, ex-post-facto approval in respect of MoUs signed with 13 countries namely, Netherlands, Nepal, Cyprus,Israel, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Tanzania, Surinam, Zambia, Syria, Bhutan, Chile and Mauritius is being obtained.

Boost to Ease of Doing Business in Petroleum & Natural Gas Sector
The entire process, including Inter Ministerial Consultations (IMC) is quite lengthy and time consuming.
In consonance with the Government initiative of ‘Ease of Doing Business’, it is desirable to shorten the duration of time taken for award of the Blocks / Contract Areas.
In the first Bid round, 55 blocks, having an area of 59282 sq.km spreading across 11 States have been offered for bidding.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today interacted with Collectors and Officers-in-charge of aspirational districts, at a Conference organized by NITI Aayog at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre in New Delhi.
This event is in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Transforming India by 2022.
The Union Government has embarked upon a major policy initiative for the rapid transformation of 115 districts that are lagging on specific development parameters.
Six groups of officers made presentations on the themes of nutrition, education, basic infrastructure, agriculture and water resources, eradication of Left Wing Extremism and financial inclusion and skill development.
Addressing the gathering, which also included many Union Ministers and senior Union Government officers, the Prime Minister said this is the first official programme at the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre, and therefore has a special significance.
In that context, he added, this effort to develop 115 backward districts, is in keeping with the vision of Dr. Ambedkar, who worked for the upliftment of the under-privileged.
He emphasized that there is limitless potential, limitless possibilities, and limitless opportunities now in India.
In this context, he mentioned the improvement in ease of doing business.
He credited officials of the Government – and Team India – for this success.
The Prime Minister said that top-down solutions do not yield results.
Therefore, the effort is that people on the field contribute to solutions.
In this context, he appreciated the clarity of thought, and faith in conviction, in the presentations today.
The Prime Minister said that regional imbalances should not be allowed to increase indefinitely.
Therefore, the development of backward districts is imperative.
He said that success stories are vital to change the negative psyche and mindset in these areas.
The first step is to convert this mindset of pessimism into one of optimism, he explained.
The Prime Minister said that public movements for development require a meeting of minds in the core team.
In this context he suggested brainstorming at the district level.
There need to be systematic arrangements to involve people, he said, giving the example of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
He emphasized the importance of building positive narratives and optimism in the achievement of development targets.
We need to recognise and channelize the aspirations of the people of the aspirational districts, the Prime Minister said.
He said public participation should lead to a matching of the aspirations of people, with schemes of Governments.
He said the Collectors of the 115 aspirational districts have the opportunity to earn lasting satisfaction, by delivering on development objectives.
He said challenges are the path to achieving success in life, and these Collectors have the opportunity for that.
He called for a concerted effort to achieve visible results in three months, till Babasaheb Ambedkar’s birth anniversary on April 14th.
He said he wishes to personally visit one such well-performing district in the month of April.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its ex-post facto approvalfor signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which was signed in November, 2015between Airports Authority of India (On behalf of Government of India) and Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (On behalf of Government of Singapore) in Civil Aviation during Prime Minister’s visit to Singapore.
This cooperation will be extended to other airports with mutual consent.
The salient features of the MoU include collaboration in Civil Aviation Sector in the areas of (a) Master-planning and design (b) Traffic development (c) Commercial development (d) Service quality improvement (e) Training and development (f) Cargo handling and Management (g) Maintenance, repair and overhaul (h) Operation and management and (i) any other areas with mutual consent.
A need was felt that in order to ensure high standards of service at Ahmedabad and Jaipur airports, Airport Authority of India (AAI) may enter into operation and maintenance (O&M) contracts, either with or without the responsibility of maximization of non-aeronautical revenue in the terminal building (excluding land on city side and air side).

He said that every effort would be made to work towards the development of the State, keeping in mind this vision.
My colleagues in government,
Friends and Distinguished Guests from India and abroad,
I am happy, to be here today, to address the Sixth Delhi Economics Conclave.
This is a good platform for bringing together economists, policy-makers, and thought-leaders, from India and abroad.
– Maximum value for every rupee spent.
– Maximum empowerment for our poor.
– Maximum technology penetration among the masses.
But let me start by taking a brief look at the Indian economy.
We have embarked on a course of fiscal consolidation.
We have entered for the first time into a monetary framework agreement, with the Reserve Bank to curb inflation.
Even while cutting the fiscal deficit we have substantially increased productive public investment.
This has been made possible in two ways.
Firstly, we have imposed, carbon taxes on fossil fuels.
We have replaced them with taxes.
We have actually acted.
Secondly, we have reduced wasteful expenditure through innovative methods like the use of technology.
These are reforms that you are probably aware of.
But our reforms are far broader, and far deeper, than is generally recognised.
Before I elaborate on this, I would like to raise two issues.
The first is, REFORM FOR WHAT?
What is the aim of reform?
Is it just to increase the measured rate of GDP growth?
Or is it to bring about a transformation in society?
My answer is clear.
We must REFORM TO TRANSFORM.
Who is the target audience?
Is our aim to impress groups of experts and score points in intellectual discussions?
Or to achieve ranks in some international league table?
Again, my answer is clear.
It is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
In short, reform is not an end in itself.
Reform for me, is just a way station on the long journey to the destination.
The destination is transformation of India.
Therefore, REFORM TO TRANSFORM.
The reforms we have undertaken, are of many types.
For simplicity, I will classify them as financial, structural and institutional.
It will not be possible for me to cover all of them here.
But I will certainly mention some of the most important.
Let me start with the financial reforms.
We talk often about interest rates and credit policy.
Changes in interest rates are debated for months.
Tons of newsprint and hours of television are spent on it.
Interest rates are no doubt very important.
But are they important to a person locked out of the banking system?
To a person who has no prospect of ever lending or borrowing from a bank?
And if large sections of a country are in this position then how important are interest rates?
It is for this reason that development experts have been advocating financial inclusion.
What we have done in the last 17 months is to bring one hundred and ninety million people into the banking system.
This is more than the population of most of the countries in the world.
Not only have these people been brought into the system but they have shown that there is great strength at the bottom of the pyramid.
Believe it or not, accounts opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana today have a total balance of almost Rs. 26,000 crores or nearly four billion dollars.
Clearly our financial inclusion reform has been transformational.
And yet this quiet revolution has hardly been noticed.
The Jan Dhan Yojana has also transformed the ability of the poor to make and to receive electronic payments.
Every Jan Dhan account holder is eligible for a debit card.
India’s banks are also being encouraged to operate ‘mobile ATMs’.
A mobile ATM is one where cash can be drawn and simple banking tasks done through a hand held device.
Thanks to Jan Dhan Yojana and the RuPay debit card, we have also introduced healthy competition in the debit-credit card space.
This has traditionally been dominated by a few international players.
Even one year ago, there were hardly any indigenous card brands in the market.
Today, 36 % of debit cards in India are Ru-Pay cards.
Financial inclusion is not just about opening bank accounts or enabling electronic payments.
I firmly believe, that India has tremendous entrepreneurial energy.
This needs to be harnessed so that we become a nation of job-creators, rather than job seekers.
When we took office, we found that 58 million non-corporate enterprises provided one 128 million jobs.
60% of them were in rural areas.
Over 40% were owned by people from the Backward Classes and 15% by Scheduled Castes and Tribes.
But bank credit accounted for a tiny share of their financing.
Most of them never get any bank credit.
In other words the most employment-intensive sector of the economy gets the least credit!
While Jan Dhan Yojana was to bring banking to the unbanked the second reform was to bring funding to the unfunded.
We are creating a new financing and regulatory architecture under the Micro-Units Development and Refinance Agency scheme popularly known as MUDRA.
If one conservatively estimates that each loan creates 2 jobs we have laid the foundation for 12 million new jobs.
We are also creating an environment that fosters innovation and start-ups through the Atal Innovation Mission and the Self Employment and Talent Utilisation programme.
Another financial reform is the provision of a safety net through new social security schemes.
We have introduced three non-subsidised but low cost schemes covering accident insurance life insurance and pensions.
Because of their massive coverage the premia are low.
There are now over 120 million subscribers.
For many of these reforms to be successful we need a strong banking system.
We inherited a system where cronyism and corruption were believed to be rampant in banking decisions and in appointments to public sector banks.
After the first ever retreat of a Prime Minister with bankers, known as the Gyan Sangam, we have moved decisively to change this.
Major steps have been taken to improve efficiency, including clear performance measures and accountability mechanisms.
We have made a commitment to ensuring adequate capital.
But more than that there have been very powerful non-financial steps.
Interference in banking decisions has ended.
A new process for appointments is being put in place under the Bank Boards Bureau.
Credible and capable bankers have been appointed to head banks.
For the first time since banks were nationalised 46 years ago private sector professionals have been appointed in key positions.
This is a major reform.
There is a whole eco-system focused on alleviating poverty.
Perhaps this can be called the ‘poverty alleviation industry’.
Obviously the intentions are good.
Well designed schemes and subsidies do have an important place.
But empowering the poor is far more effective than empowering the poverty alleviation industry.
Our financial reforms empower the poor to fight poverty themselves.
I can take the analogy of a house.
So also, empowering the poor through financial inclusion and social security will provide a more stable and lasting solution.
Let me now turn to structural reforms in various sectors.
Agriculture remains India’s mainstay in terms of providing livelihood.
We have introduced a series of reforms.
There was a tendency to divert subsidised fertiliser for the production of chemicals.
This had been tried on a small scale earlier.
We are now moving towards universal neem-coating of urea.
This has already saved crores of rupees of diverted farm subsidies.
It is an example of how simple reforms can be very effective.
140 million soil health cards will be issued, requiring a collection of over twenty-five million soil samples.
They will be tested through a nationwide network of nearly 1500 laboratories.
About four million samples have already been collected.
This too is a reform to transform.
It involves building twenty million urban houses and thirty million rural houses, totalling nearly fifty million.
The programme will make sure no Indian is houseless.
It will also generate a large amount of employment mainly for the unskilled the semi-skilled and the poor.
This multi-pronged program is also a transformative reform.
Much has been said and written about India’s labour markets.
We have already undertaken some important steps.
Over a period of years, this will have a major impact on the quality of employment in India.
Before becoming Prime Minister, I had received many inputs about the reforms needed in India from many economic experts.
However, none of them touched on the issue of cleanliness and sanitation.
Sanitation has languished for years as a poor cousin of health or of drinking water supply.
Yet, you will all agree that poor sanitation and lack of cleanliness is much more than an issue of health.
It touches upon every aspect of our well-being.
It is of particular importance to women.
If this reform succeeds, as I am confident it will, India would have been transformed.
We have undertaken major managerial improvements in the transport sector.
However, this micro-economic virtue, can become a macro-economic vice.
It implies a high level of gold imports.
We have just launched a series of gold-related schemes.
These will provide Indians with the inflation protection of gold along with a modest interest without actually holding it.
If the scheme reaches its potential, it will help meet the rational expectations of the public while moderating imports.
Surely, this too is an important reform with potential to transform.
Let me now turn to institutional and governance reforms.
For years, the Planning Commission was widely criticised.
It was generally seen as a cumbersome centralising force which imposed central will on the states.
It is another matter that some of its strongest critics suddenly developed a nostalgic admiration for the institution they had hated till the previous day.
But we already have concrete examples of its transformative power.
As you all know, the 14th Finance Commission recommended that states be given an enhanced share of Central revenues as automatic devolution.
Despite some internal advice to the contrary, I decided to accept the recommendation.
This has created a need to restructure Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
Ever since the First Five Year Plan in 1952, such decisions were taken unilaterally by the Centre.
We did something very different.
The task of fixing the sharing pattern of Central schemes was entrusted not to a group of Central ministers but to a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers in NITI.
And I am delighted to say, that in a fine example of co-operative federalism at its best, the Chief Ministers have unanimously agreed on a set of recommendations.
This is despite the fact that this is a very complex issue, and that they come from many different political parties.
I received their report, on 27th October.
On many other issues too, the Chief Ministers are taking the lead in setting the national agenda.
By reforming the institution, we have transformed the relationship.
Our work on ‘Make in India’ and ‘Ease of Doing Business’ is of course well known.
Our push to ‘Make in India’ must be viewed in the context of the very slow growth in world trade.
The growth rate of trade exceeded GDP growth from 1983 to 2008.
Since then, trade has been growing more slowly than GDP.
Therefore, producing for domestic consumption is important for growth.
But a new feature, is the very healthy and constructive competition among states.
You would be surprised to know, that among the top few states are Jharkhand, Chattisgarh and Odisha.
This is an example of constructive competitive federalism.
In a break with over sixty-five years of tradition we have involved states even in foreign policy.
The Ministry of External Affairs has been asked to work with the States.
Making the States think globally is yet another reform with potential to transform.
I firmly believe that India’s people are far more mature and far more public-spirited than arm-chair critics and experts give them credit for.
An important governance issue is the mutual trust between citizens and the state.
We made a beginning in trusting the citizens by abolishing many requirements for ‘attestation’ of signatures.
For example, the Department of Higher Education, has permitted self attestation by students of documents used for admission in various academic courses.
We also ended the requirement to visit government offices for life certification for pensioners by introducing online biometric identification.
Economists have traditionally believed that people act in their self interest.
This will enable us to liberate many poor women from the health hazards of using firewood including respiratory illness.
The response has been tremendous.
Within a few months over four million Indians have given up their cooking gas subsidies.
Most of them are not rich households and belong to the lower middle class.
If any of you in this room still have a subsidised connection let me appeal to you to join them.
This brings me to an achievement that I think even our worst critics do not dispute.
This is the change in levels of corruption.
For many years, economists and other experts have held corruption to be one of the main constraints on the growth of any developing economy.
We have taken decisive steps to curb corruption.
I have already referred to what has been done in public sector banks.
Another major reform is well known.
This is the removal of discretion in allocation of key resources.
Our auctions of coal spectrum and FM radio licences have produced major additional revenues.
Interviews for lower level government jobs have widely been seen, as a source of corruption.
We have recently abolished the system of interviews for lower level posts in government.
We will rely on transparent written examination results to decide who will be selected.
Our campaign against tax evasion and money laundering is also well known.
Rs. 6500 crores has been assessed before the new Black Money Act was implemented.
Additionally, over Rs 4000 crores has been declared under the new Act.
Thus over Rs 10,500 crores of black money from abroad has been detected and assessed.
If we can sustain this improvement in integrity and transparency what can be a more transformative reform?
We are also taking several steps to serve the honest taxpayer better.
Electronic filing of returns now covers 85% of all tax returns.
Earlier, electronic returns had to be followed by a paper verification which used to take weeks to be processed.
Nearly 90% of refunds were issued within 90 days.
I have asked the Income Tax Department to move to a system where not only returns but also scrutiny is done without having to go to the office.
Queries could be raised and answered online or by Email.
I have also instructed that the performance appraisal system, for Income Tax Officers be changed.
The appraisal should reflect, whether or not the officer’s orders and assessments have been upheld on appeal.
This will deter corruption and also motivate officers to pass correct orders.
When fully implemented, these changes, namely online scrutiny, and changes in performance appraisal have transformative potential.
This is a distinguished gathering.
You have many interesting and thought provoking sessions ahead.
My appeal to all of you, is to think beyond conventional remedies.
Our idea of reforms should be inclusive and broad-based.
The goal of reforms is not better headlines in the pink papers, but better lives for our people.
I am sure you with your knowledge will come up with even better ideas.
I look forward to hearing from you of more ‘reforms to transform’ which will make life better for the whole of India.
Then not only we in India but the whole world will benefit.
Chairman of the Seoul Peace Prize Cultural Foundation, Mr. Kwon E-hyock
Speaker of the National Assembly, Mr. Moon Hee-sang
Minister for Culture, Mr. Do Jong-hwan
Distinguished dignitaries
Ladies and Gentlemen
The award belongs to the success that India has achieved in the less than five years, powered by the strengths and skillsof one point three billion Indians.
And so, on their behalf, I humbly accept the Award and express my gratitude.
This award is a recognition of the philosophy that has given the message of वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम which means the entire world is one family.
May there be peace every where in the sky in space,
And, I am honoured that this award is being conferred on me in the year that we celebrate the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The Seoul Peace Prize was established to mark the success and spirit of the 24th Summer Olympics held in Seoul in 1988.
The games showcased the best of Korean culture,the warmth of Korean hospitality, and the success of the Korean economy.
And,not to forget, they marked the arrival of a new sporting power-house in the global arena!
But,the games were also an important landmark in world history.
The 1988 Olympics were held at a time of many changes in the world.
The Iran-Iraq War had just ended.
The Geneva Accords relating to the situation in Afghanistan had been signed earlier that year.
And for a while, it did.
Health-care and education outcomes have been improving.
A few weeks before the Seoul Olympics, an organization called Al-Qaeda was formed.
Today, radicalization and terrorism have become globalized and are the biggest threats to global peace and security.
And, millions of people around the world still remain without adequate and quality access to food, shelter,health-care, sanitation, power, and above all, dignity of life.
Clearly, there is a lot more that needs to be done.The solution to the hard-ships we face is in hard work.
And, India is doing her part.
We have been working to improve the well being of the people of India – who form one-sixth of humanity.
India is today the fastest growing large economy in the world with strong economic fundamentals.
This has been possible because of the major economic changes that we have introduced.
Flag-ship initiatives such as ‘Make in India’, ‘Skill India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Clean India’ have contributed to visible socio-economic growth.
We have focused on financial inclusion, access to credit, digital transactions, last mile connectivity, andsupport to small and medium enterprise so as to spread development across the country and enrich all the citizens of India.
In all our efforts, we are guided by Mahatma Gandhi’s teaching that we should recall the face of the poorest and the weakest person that we have ever seen and ask ourselves if the step that we plan is going to be of any benefit to that person.
India’s growth story is not only good for the people of India but also for the entire world.
We live in an increasingly connected world.
As the third largest economy, our growth and prosperity will inevitably contribute to global growth and development.
We are committed to make a peaceful, stable and economically inter-linked world.
India, as a responsible member of the international community, has also been in the fore-front of our collective fight against climate change.
Despite having a historically low carbon foot-print, India has been playing an active role in the global fight against climate change.
At the domestic level, this has been done by unveiling a National Action Plan to reduce carbon emissions, increase forest cover, and replacing traditional carbon fuels with renewable energy supplies.
We have carried out operations in conflict zones and rescued not only Indians but also nationals of many other countries.
We have been an active and considerate development partner for other developing countries, with our guiding principle being to help in developing their physical and social infrastructure.
Through these efforts, we seek to ensure that the benefits of a globalised and inter-connected world are equally experienced by all.
Over the past few years, my Government has renewed interaction and forged new partnerships across continents.
In the East Asian context, we have redefined our engagements with countries in the region, including with Republic of Korea, under our Act East Policy.
I am glad to hear an echo of our approach in President Moon’s New Southern Policy.
India has been the land of peace for ages.
The people of India have practiced the concept of peace and harmonious co-existence for thousands of years.
With hundreds of languages and dialects, many states, and major religions, India is proud to be one of the most diverse nations in the world.
We are proud that ours is a land where people of all faiths, beliefs, and communities can prosper.
We are proud that ours is a society based not only on tolerance, but on celebration of differences and diverse cultures.
Like Korea, India has also suffered the pain of cross-border strife.
Our endeavour towards peaceful development has only too often been de-railed by cross-border terrorism.
The time has come for all those who believe in humanity to join hands to completely eradicate terrorist networks and their financing, supply channels, and to counter terrorist ideology and propaganda.
Only by doing so can we replace hate with harmony; destruction with development; and, transform the landscape of violence and vendetta into a post-card for peace.
Progress over the past year towards peace on the Korean peninsula has been heartening.
As the popular Korean saying goes:
Shichagi Bhanida,
“A good beginning is half the battle”.
I have every confidence that with continued efforts from the Korean people, peace will soon prevail on the Korean Peninsula.
Gamsa Hamnida !

We can take pride in the economic initiatives of the BRICS.
These will not only strengthen BRICS economies, but will also benefit the developing world.
As BRICS, we must place our priorities on the agenda and activities of G20.
Two, in the area of global finance, G20 should focus on,
• Implementation of the decisions to restructure global economic institutions.
• Greater collaboration between multilateral and regional financial institutions.
• Enhanced long term finance for infrastructure in developing countries.
• Developing next generation, climate resilient infrastructure.
This would also include converting waste into inputs for infrastructure.
• lower the cost of global remittances well before 2030,
• close coordination on preventing corruption and cooperation on freezing of unaccounted money hoarded abroad and its repatriation.
Three, in the area of trade, we should focus on,
• Strengthening the rule-based global trading system and ensuring that new trading blocs do not lead to division of the global trade regime.
• speeding up the completion of the Doha Development Agenda.
• promoting greater mobility of skilled professionals and creating a global skill force market.
Four, in the area of climate change, G20’s priorities should include,
• a successful outcome at the COP21 based on the principles of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
• Facilitate climate finance and technology transfer to developing countries.
• enhance research and development on clean and renewable energy to increase access, efficiency and affordability of clean energy.
• support development of next generation and climate resistant infrastructure.
• Support the India-proposed international solar alliance.
• comprehensive global strategy to put an end to finance, supplies and communication channels of the terrorists.
• stopping the flow of arms and explosives to terrorist groups.
• Creating special international legal regime to disrupt terrorist activities.
• cooperation in preventing the use of cyber networks by terrorist groups.
• early adoption of Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.
I am confident that BRICS economies will continue to be strong and stable and will remain a source of strength for the global economy.
The Strategy for BRICS Economic Cooperation, which we endorsed in Ufa, is an important framework document.
The Contact Group on Trade and Economic Issues and Business Council should prepare a Work Plan for implementation of the Strategy in a time-bound manner.
Each BRICS member country should take the lead in at least two priority areas listed in the Strategy.
It would be appropriate if the first joint meeting is held during the Russian Chairmanship.
The joint sitting may also work on a Roadmap for Trade, Economic and Investment Cooperation till 2020.
We hope that the New Development Bank will start its operations quickly.
As I said in Ufa, its first project should be on clean energy, preferably across all BRICS countries.
We need to create a supporting mechanism, such as a New Development Bank Institute or NDBI, which should function as bank of ideas, a storehouse of experience and a knowledge powerhouse.
India will continue to work closely with our BRICS partners in the spirit of mutual trust, respect and transparency.
I had shared some ideas at Ufa.
These included trade fairs; agriculture research; railway research; digital initiative; energy efficient technologies; cooperation between states, cities and local bodies; promoting films and sports exchange.
We will be building upon them and putting more new ideas on the BRICS agenda.
We will work with you to further strengthen the institutional mechanisms of BRICS.
I look forward to seeing you in India for the 8th Summit next year.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the International Conference on Frontiers in Yoga Research and its applications, at Jigani, Bengaluru.
He unveiled the Foundation Stone for a hospital of integrative medicine.
Following is the text of the Prime Minister’s inaugural address:-
It is a great pleasure and privilege to participate in the 21st International Conference on frontiers in yoga research and its applications.
Iam deeply grateful to Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhan Sansthan for organizing this conference.
He had a deep understanding of the beauty of human diversity and spoke passionately for unity in our world.
This is a particularly special year for the science of yoga.
On June 21, more than a million people in 192 countries came together to celebrate the first International Day of Yoga.
The overwhelming global support is a mark of Yoga’s growing international popularity.
It is also a symbol of the universal aspiration for health and well being.
It reflects the shared global desire for balance between human and Mother Nature; and, peace and harmony between people and nations.
Above all, it demonstrated once again the capacity of people from different cultures to reach beyond the familiar boundaries of their lives and unite in pursuit of a larger good.
It is this spirit of unity that demonstrates the timeless science of yoga.
And, it is this belief in the power of yoga and faith in humanity that I proposed this initiative in my inaugural address to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2014.
When it comes to a sustainable future for our world, a healthy habit and happier people, a change in our way of life that influences the choices we make as individuals, nations and global community is important.
This is a recognition that is dawning on the world.
And, across cultures and geography, people are increasingly taking to yoga to redefine their lives – to find oneness between their inner self and outer world; between their existence and their environment.
The WHO fact sheet on the global burden of disease says that non-communicable diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide.
By 2030, low-income countries will have eight times more deaths attributed to NCDs than high-income countries.
In India, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and other Non Communicable Diseases are estimated to account for 60% of all deaths.
These diseases account for about 40% of all hospital stays and roughly 35% of all recorded outpatient visits.
We face the tragedy of productive lives cut short and families that must deal with untimely loss; the huge toll on the economy; and, the excessive burden on the over-stretched health system.
Some studies have estimated that India stands to lose about 4.58 trillion dollars before 2030 due to non communicable diseases and mental health conditions.
So, we must address the question of psychological state of our existence as much as we try to advance our physical and material life.
This is where the role of Yoga is paramount.
Across the world, there are moving stories of transformed lives and rekindled hopes due to Yoga.
The prediction of Shri Aurobindo that “Indian Yoga … is potentially one of these dynamic elements of the future life of humanity” is coming true.
This discipline was not originally considered or conceived as system of medicine.
But, because Yoga is about aholistic lifestyle and the physical, mental, intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual harmony, it has profound health benefits.
It fits well with the change in the way that world increasingly defines health.
We are no longer satisfied with just preventing and managing diseases.
People now demand promotion of wellness, which is a healthy balance of the mind, body and spirit.
We now increasingly hear voices calling for holistic treatment, which means dealing not just with the immediate ailment, but with the complete person, physically, psychologically, socially, and spiritually.
Traditional Indian systems are rooted in looking at human beings in totality.
And, they are without side effects.
As I argued at the Science Congress this morning, like traditional knowledge, science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of Nature.
So, we must recognize that science, as we see it, does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world.
And, we must remember that the western system of thought, from Hippocrates to Percival to Edison have expressed views on health that are not fundamentally different from the philosophy of the Indian System.
So, along with the accumulated wisdom and experience gathered over the ages, we must also apply the techniques and methods of modern science to test and validate results, assure quality and explain benefits.
And, this is why we are placing emphasis on our efforts to increase awareness, acceptance and adoption of AYUSH System of Medicine.
And, in doing so, we will create better wellness among people, rely more on local resources and reduce healthcare costs.
We will also reduce the social and economic costs to our society and promote a more environment friendly healthcare system.
I am not here to advocate the supremacy of one system over another.
I believe that humanity is wealthier for its diversity.
Civilisations, cultures and countries have enriched each other by sharing their knowledge and wisdom.
And, we can progress more by learning from each other.
It is in this spirit that Swami Vivekananda called for combining the best from the East and the West.
So, it must be in the area of healthcare.
My vision for healthcare is an integrated system that understands and builds on the best and most effective of different traditions.
This is why I deeply appreciate your effort to integrate Yoga, Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Modern Medicine by bringing prominent researchers and doctors on one platform.Your focus on four major non-communicable diseases – Diabetes, Cancer, Psychiatric disorders, Hypertension and Cardiovascular diseases is appreciable.
It addresses issues that are very close to my heart.
Modern systems of medicine have transformed healthcare; screening, detection and diagnosis of diseases.
Use of technology has reduced barriers to accessing health care, and improved our understanding of disease patterns.
Breakthroughs in medicines and vaccines have helped conquer and contain many diseases.
Their popularity is growing.
Yoga is now a global heritage.
And, the world is embracing traditional Indian medicine with great enthusiasm.
So, we look to you at this conference to define the path forward in the service of humanity.
I hope that health professionals, policymakers, government organizations and Industry will bridge the distance between the various forms of medical systems.
I hope that you will to integrate yoga and traditional Indian medicine more closely into our healthcare system and make wellness a part of life for all in India and rest of the world.
You will contribute not only to healthier and happier life for people, but also to a more prosperous and peaceful world, and a more sustainable future for our planet.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today gifted 200 cows to villagers who do not yet own a cow, under the Rwandan Government’s Girinka Programme.
The function to mark the handing over of cows was held at Rweru Model Village, in the presence of Rwandan President Paul Kagame.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister appreciated the Girinka Programme, and President Paul Kagame’s initiative in this regard.
He said people in India too would be pleasantly surprised to see the cow being given such importance as a means of economic empowerment in villages, in faraway Rwanda.
He spoke of the similarity in rural life in the two countries.
He said that the Girinka Programme will help transform villages in Rwanda.
The word Girinka can be translated as ‘may you have a cow’ and describes a centuries-old cultural practice in Rwanda whereby a cow was given by one person to another, as a sign of respect and gratitude.
Girinka was initiated by President Paul Kagame in response to the alarmingly high rate of childhood malnutrition and as a way to accelerate poverty reduction and integrate livestock and crop farming.
The program is based on the premise that providing a dairy cow to poor Girinka Programme transforms livelihoods, reconciles communities improving agricultural productivity through the use of manure as fertilizers which would lead to improving soil quality and reducing erosion through the planting of grasses and trees.
Since its introduction in 2006 hundreds of thousands have received cows through the Girinka program.
By June 2016, a total of 248,566 cows had been distributed to poor households.
The program has contributed to an increase in agricultural production in Rwanda – especially milk production and products, reduced malnutrition and increased incomes.
While this was not an original goal of Girinka, it has evolved to become a significant aspect of the program.
The program also follows a certain criteria in choosing who the beneficiaries should be.
As per a Govt. of Rwanda official, they mainly look at those very poor vulnerable families that don’t own a cow but do have land that can be used to grow grass for feeding the cows.
The beneficiary should be in position to construct an animal shed or willing to join others in community to construct a communal cow shed to be jointly used with the rest.

Japan has always been a valuable partner in India’s journey to economic prosperity, infrastructure development, capacity building and technology advancement.
The scope and scale of our co-operation extends to diverse fields.
Our economic links continue to flourish.
Trade ties continue to grow.
And, Investments from Japan are on the rise.
Japanese companies have much to gain by participating in our flagship development initiatives.
We, in turn, have much to gain from Japan’s unparalleled status as the leader in technology and innovation.
A welcome feature of our ties is the increase in contacts and co-operation between states in India and prefectures in Japan.
It is a reflection of the high priority that we accord to Japan in our worldview.
Our ties are nurtured by the fountain of goodwill and mutual admiration that our two peoples have for one another.
And, are led most ably by the strong leadership of Excellency Abe.
My meeting with him today is the eighth one in the last two years.
As we celebrate the many outcomes of our Summit meeting, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Prime Minister Abe and the Government of Japan for the warm welcome and excellent arrangements made for me and my delegation.
Without doubt, our destinies are interlinked.
The ocean waters of the Indo-Pacific that lap the coast of Japan also form the surf that breaks on the shores of India.
Let us work together for peace, prosperity and development.
Ladies & Gentlemen,
May I now propose a toast:
To the continued good health and personal well-being of Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress of Japan, To the profound success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the friendly people of Japan and each one of you present here tonight,
To the ever-lasting friendship between India and Japan,
He attended the Closing Ceremony of the Birth Centenary Celebration of the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche in Leh.
At the same event, he unveiled a plaque to mark the commencement of work on the Zojila Tunnel.
The 14 km long Zojila tunnel will be India’s longest road tunnel and Asia’s longest bi-directional tunnel.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister, had approved the construction, operation and maintenance of this tunnel between Baltal and Minamarg, on the Srinagar-Leh section of NH-1A, at a total cost of Rs 6800 crore earlier this year.
The construction of this tunnel will provide all-weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh.
It will cut down the time taken to cross the Zojila pass from the present three and a half hours, to just fifteen minutes.
Addressing a large gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister recalled the rich contribution of the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche.
His was a life dedicated to serving others, the Prime Minister said.
He added that the 19th Kushok Bakula Rinpoche distinguished himself as an outstanding diplomat.
He mentioned that during his visit to Mongolia, he had witnessed first-hand, the goodwill he has in that country.
Shri Narendra Modi expressed happiness that he is visiting the three regions of Jammu and Kashmir today.
He said the State of Jammu and Kashmir is going to get development projects worth Rs. 25,000 crore.
These projects will have a positive impact on the people of the state, he added.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved MoU on passenger cruise services on the coastal and protocol routes between India and Bangladesh for starting regular movement of passengers and tourists in water crafts between the two countries.
India’s own research projects with specific targets can be taken up in conjunction with other countries.
The long coastline of India and severe power deficit in the country, warrant the study of ocean renewable energies.
Vagaries of the sea makes harnessing ocean energy a technological challenge.
In the Indian context designing of scaled up ocean energy devices (including wave, currents and tidal) and their techno-commercial viability needs to be undertaken.
NIOT, an autonomous research institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, is working in the area of ocean energy and desalination.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the proposal to introduce a Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017.
The Bill would provide for a comprehensive resolution framework for specified financial sector entities to deal with bankruptcy situation in banks, insurance companies and financial sector entities.
The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance, Bill 2017 when enacted, will pave the way for setting up of the Resolution Corporation.
It would lead to repeal or amendment of resolution-related provisions in sectoral Acts as listed in Schedules of the Bill.
It will also result in the repealing of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act, 1961 to transfer the deposit insurance powers and responsibilities to the Resolution Corporation.
The Resolution Corporation would protect the stability and resilience of the financial system; protecting the consumers of covered obligations up to a reasonable limit; and protecting public funds, to the extent possible.
The Government has recently enacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“Code”) for the insolvency resolution of non- financial entities.
The proposed Bill complements the Code by providing a resolution framework for the financial sector.
Once implemented, this Bill together with the Code will provide a comprehensive resolution framework for the economy.
The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, 2017 seeks to give comfort to the consumers of financial service providers in financial distress.
It also aims to inculcate discipline among financial service providers in the event of financial crises by limiting the use of public money to bail out distressed entities.
It would help in maintaining financial stability in the economy by ensuring adequate preventive measures, while at the same time providing the necessary instruments for dealing with an event of crisis.
The Bill aims to strengthen and streamline the current framework of deposit insurance for the benefit of a large number of retail depositors.
I fondly recall the modest launch of this event in 2003.
Since then it has been a very successful journey.
I express my gratitude to the partner countries and organisations – a list which includes Japan, Canada, USA, UK, Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, France, Poland, Sweden, Singapore and UAE.
You should also visit the trade show and the exhibition where hundreds of companies have showcased their products and processes.
Gujarat, the land of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, also represents the business spirit of India.
Gujarat is currently in the midst of the Kite Festival.
May the kites inspire us all to fly high.
As I have often said India’s strength lies in the three Ds: Democracy, Demography and Demand.
Some people say that democracy cannot deliver effective and fast track governance.
But we have seen in the last two and a half years that it is possible to deliver quick results in a democratic set up as well.
Coming to Demography, ours is a nation of vibrant youth.
We are the second largest English speaking country.
Our youth are not merely looking for jobs.
They have begun taking risks and often prefer to become Entrepreneurs.
On the Demand front, our rising middle class offers a huge domestic market.
Nature has been kind to us.
Our three crop seasons enable us to grow food, vegetables and fruits in abundance.
The richness of our culture and its living symbols is unique.
All this helps ensure a good quality of life, at relatively low cost.
Our Government was elected first and foremost on the promise to provide clean Governance and end the prevailing regime of corruption and nepotism.
It is our vision and mission to bring a paradigm shift in the ways of our polity and economy.
We have taken a series of decisions and steps in this direction.
To give you some examples, we are bringing a shift:
In doing this, digital technology has played a key role.
I have often said that e-governance is easy and effective Governance.
I have also emphasized the need for policy driven Governance.
Online processes help bring speed and openness in decision making.
Towards this end, we are working to adopt and absorb newer technologies, to bring about transparency, and to end discretion.
Over the last two and a half years, we have worked relentlessly to realise India’s potential, and to set right the economy.
The results have been encouraging.
There has been substantial improvement in key macro-economic indicators like GDP growth, inflation, fiscal deficit, current account deficit as well as foreign investments.
Despite the global slowdown, we have registered excellent growth.Today, India is a bright spot in the global economy.
We are seen as the engine of global growth.
World Bank, IMF and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days.
In 2014-15, India contributed 12.5 per cent of global growth.
These are just a few examples of the direction in which we are going.
My government is strongly committed to continue the reform of the Indian economy.
We have placed the highest emphasis on Ease of Doing Business.
We have taken decisive steps to ease licensing processes, and rationalize provisions and procedures relating to clearances, returns, and inspections.
We are monitoring implementation of hundreds of action points across various sectors, aimed at improving the regulatory framework.
This is part of our promise of Good Governance.
The outcomes of our efforts are visible in India’s global rankings on various indicators.
A number of global reports and assessments over the last two years have shown that India has improved its policies, practices and hence its economic profile.
India’s rank has improved considerably, in the World Bank’s Doing Business Report.
India is ranked third in the list of top prospective host economies for 2016-18 in the World Investment Report 2016 released by UNCTAD.
Our rank also improved by thirty two positions in World Economic Forum’s ‘Global Competitiveness Report 2015-16 and 2016-17’;
We have moved up sixteen ranks in the ‘Global Innovation Index 2016’ brought out by WIPO and other institutions;
We have moved up nineteen positions in the World Bank’s ‘Logistics Performance Index of 2016.’
Every day, we are further rationalising our policies and procedures, to make it simple for businesses to establish and grow.
This unleashing of the youth power is heartening.
The total FDI inflows in the last two and a half years have touched US Dollars one hundred and thirty billion.
The number of countries from where FDI is coming in, and the sectors in which they are being routed have also diversified in the last two years.
India is now the leading recipient of capital investment in the Asia-Pacific.
But the story does not end here.
India has left every other country behind in terms of providing return on investment.
In 2015, India has risen to first position in the Baseline Profitability Index.
‘Make in India’ has celebrated its second anniversary recently.
I am delighted to share that we have become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth largest previously.
Our Gross Value Added in manufacturing has recorded a growth of nine per cent in 2015-16.
This is much higher than the five to six per cent growth in the previous three years.
All this is helping us expand the job market and raise the purchasing power of our people.
But the real potential is even higher.
To give you a few examples: India’s Food Processing Industry is expected to increase almost five fold in the next ten years.
Similarly, India’s low vehicle penetration makes it one of the world’s most attractive auto markets.
At the Government level, we have to ensure that our growth process is inclusive and embraces both rural and urban communities.
We are committed to an India with:
· Better job opportunities;
· Better purchasing power;
· Better quality of life;
· And better living standards.
Our Development needs are huge.
Our development agenda is ambitious.
This includes Freight Corridors, Industrial Corridors, High Speed and Metro Rail projects, Logistics Parks, Smart Cities, Coastal Zones, regional airports, water, sanitation and energy initiatives.
Our per capita electricity consumption must rise.
Even as we do so, we are committed to promoting renewable energy.
The targets for construction of roads and laying of railways have been increased manifold.
India is going to emerge as one of the world’s largest construction markets as it adds millions of homes.
All this offers unprecedented opportunities for the investor community.
Most of you can work with us in a number of areas which include:
· From hardware to software;
· From soft skills to scientific temper
· From defence systems to cyber security
· From medicine to tourism;
I daresay, that India alone offers the opportunities that could rival those of an entire continent.
It offers today, the possibilities of a full century.
And we want to do all this in a cleaner, greener and sustainable way.
We are committed to protect the environment and uphold our responsibility towards Nature.
Ultimately, this is what India has stood for since ages.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for establishment of Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) and Self Employment and Talent Utilisation (SETU) in NITI Aayog with appropriate manpower.
Establishment of AIM and AIM Directorate would result in implementation of Mission activities in a focussed manner.
This would be a focal point for innovation and entrepreneurship in the country.
The details are as follows:-
The Committee in its report made wide ranging recommendations for the short-term (where action can be taken relatively quickly to deliver almost immediate payoffs), medium-term (that can be addressed within a 5-7 years time frame) and long-term, which are likely to have long gestation period, but will lead to a profound transformation in the entrepreneurial fabric of the country.
The Committee also emphasized the need to establish clear systems to monitor implementation, execution, and impact.
The AIM and SETU are being initiated as a follow up of Union Budget 2015-16 announcements.

This includes over Rs. 25,000 crore in MGNREGS, and over Rs. 21,000 crore in PAHAL (for LPG).
DBT has resulted in significant savings across welfare schemes.

For instance, over 1.6 crore bogus ration cards have been deleted, resulting in savings of about Rs. 10,000 crore.
Similarly, 3.5 crore duplicate beneficiaries were weeded out in the PAHAL scheme, resulting in savings of over Rs. 14,000 crore in 2014-15 alone.

He was speaking at the inauguration of RE-Invest 2015, India’s first Renewable Energy Global Investors’ Meet and Expo, in New Delhi.
Observing that India has now graduated from Megawatts to Gigawatts in terms of renewable energy production, the Prime Minister said that even today there are lakhs of families in the country that are deprived of energy connectivity.
He said the fruits of development will not reach the common man until energy connectivity reaches every last household of the country.
The Prime Minister asserted that in this age of globalization, we have no option but to make a quantum leap in energy production and connectivity.
The Prime Minister asserted that India’s stress on renewable energy is not aimed at impressing the world, but to meet our own people’s energy requirements.
The Prime Minister spoke of the “seven horses of energy.”
He said that so far, India has focused on thermal, gas hydro and nuclear power.
But now we need to add Solar Energy, Wind Energy and Biogas Energy.
The Prime Minister said India is also working towards evolving a consortium of about 50 countries that are blessed with abundant solar radiation.
He also encouraged the installation of solar panels over water bodies to harness solar energy as well as minimize surface evaporation.
He further spoke about the need for harnessing rooftop solar power.
In the rural areas, he stressed on the need for solar pumps to reduce input costs for farmers.
He further spoke about need for micro-irrigation to conserve water and enhance crop yield for farmers.
He welcomed initiatives by many state governments in this direction.
This collective effort, he said, will truly take the country “from Megawatts to Gigawatts”.
He said that if any country has the potential to lead the world in the domain of renewable energy, it is India.
The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Commerce and Industry, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, and Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Power, Coal and New & Renewable Energy, Shri Piyush Goyal, were present on the occasion.
I am sure this team will work tirelessly towards Manipur’s development,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will visit Shirdi, Maharashtra on October 19, 2018.
Prime Minister will unveil the plaque to mark the laying of foundation stone of various development works of Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust.
He will release a silver coin to commemorate Centenary year of Shri Saibaba Samadhi.

Chief Minister of Gujarat Shri Vijay Rupani ji,
My Colleague Union Minister Dr. Harshvardhan ji,
Her Excellency Ms. Anna Ekstrom, Minister from Sweden,
Distinguished Nobel Laureates,
Dr. Goran Hansson, Vice-President of the Nobel Foundation,
Dear scientists,
Ladies and gentlemen!
The Nobel Prize is the world’s recognition at the highest level for creative ideas, thought and work on fundamental science.
Earlier, there have been occasions when one, two or three Nobel Laureates have visited India and had interactions with students and scientists in a limited manner.
But, today, we are making history by having a galaxy of Nobel Laureates in Gujarat.
One of you was born here and actually grew up in Vadodara!
I am delighted to see so many of our young students here today.
I ask all of you to urge all your friends and family to visit the Science City over the coming weeks.
Our students will cherish this extraordinary experience of interacting with you.
It will inspire them to undertake new and significant challenges that hold the key to our shared sustainable future.
I am very hopeful that this exhibition and this Series will become a strong link between you and our students, science-teachers and our scientists.
My Government has a clear vision of where we want India to be in the next 15 years.
Science and Technology is the pivot on which that vision will translate into strategy and action.
Our vision in Science and Technology Is to make sure that opportunity is available to all our youth.
That training and future preparedness should make our youth employable in the best places.
That India should be a great science destination.
That we should take major inspirational challenges such as deep sea exploration and Cyber Systems.
We have a plan that will take this vision through action.
Our scientists have been asked to develop programmes on science teaching in our schools across the country.
This will also involve training teachers.
At the next level they have been asked to create new programmes both in skilling and high-tech training.
These programmes will make you employable in the new knowledge economy and make you effective entrepreneurs and thinking scientists.
Next, our scientists will link our laboratories in cities.
You can share ideas, seminars and resources and equipment.
This will allow us to do more and better collaborative science.
Our science agencies will expand science-driven entrepreneurship and commercialisation in a big way in each state according to local needs.
My young friends, you are the future of India and the world.
India offers an enabling and unique opportunity of a large demographic dividend and the best teachers.
Young students, you are the streams that charge the wells of knowledge and expertise.
Your training and your future is what this is all about.
Thanks to science and technology, the human race has flourished.
Large numbers are enjoying a quality of life unparalleled in human history.
Yet India has a great challenge to raise many from poverty.
The maturity of our science will also be judged by a responsible treatment of our planet by the wise use of Science and Technology.
You will be scientists soon and the guardians of the planet.
We must have clear outcomes from the Nobel Exhibition and the Science City.
Globally, science & technology has emerged as one of the major drivers of socio-economic development.
In the fast growing Indian economy, there are increasing expectations for scientific interventions.
There are three outcomes I would like to see from the Nobel Prize series.
First, follow up with students and their teachers.
Do not lose track of them.
During the exhibition period, you may also have sessions for school teachers from all over Gujarat.
Second, stimulate entrepreneurship locally.
There is a great entrepreneurial zeal amongst our youth.
Our science ministries have incubators here in Gujarat.
In the next five weeks, you should have a workshop on how cutting edge science and technology-driven start-ups can be boosted.
I am told that there are about ten Nobel Prize winning discoveries that have gone into the making of a smart phone.
Prize winning Physics can both save electricity bills and the planet.
The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics was for the BLUE LED.
This came from basic research by three Japanese scientists Akasaki, Amano and Nakamura.
When combined with the previously known RED and GREEN LED, white light devices can be made that last a hundred thousand hours.
There are many such exciting discoveries being made that we can apply through enterprise.
Third, impact on society
Many Nobel Prize winning discoveries have had a huge impact on our society through health and agriculture.
For example, precision medicine using the tools of gene-technologies is now a reality.
We must use this tool to study cancer, diabetes and infectious diseases.
My young friends!
But remember that the peak rises from great mountain ranges and does not stand alone.
You are the foundation and the future of India.
You should build new ranges from which the peaks will arise.
If we focus on the foundation, in our schools and colleges and through teachers all miracles can happen.
There will be hundreds of peaks from India.
But, if we neglect the hard work at the base no peak will magically appear.
I take this opportunity to thank the Nobel Media Foundation, the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India and the Government of Gujarat for organising such an innovative programme.
The mishap took place on Sunday, 22nd April, 2016.

They strongly emphasized that the process underway in the UN to bring about the reform of the Security Council should be conducted, given its urgency, in a fixed time frame.
The leaders paid tribute to the dynamic leadership of the President of the 69th General Assembly and the efforts of the Chair of the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) in moving the IGN process towards text-based negotiations.
They welcomed the adoption by consensus of the General Assembly Decision 69/560 to use the text presented by the President of the 69th General Assembly in his letter dated 31 July 2015 as the basis for negotiations within the IGN.
They also pledged to support and cooperate with the President of the 70th General Assembly.
The leaders also noted with appreciation the efforts of Member States in moving towards text-based negotiations.
They welcomed, in particular, the efforts undertaken by the Member States of the African Group, CARICOM and the L.69 Group.
They supported Africa’s representation in both the permanent and non-permanent membership in the Security Council.
They also noted the importance of adequate and continuing representation of small and medium sized Member States, including the Small Island Developing States, in an expanded and reformed Council.
The leaders emphasized that the G-4 countries are legitimate candidates for permanent membership in an expanded and reformed Council and supported each other’s candidature.
They also reaffirmed their resolve to continue contributing to the fulfillment of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.
They pledged to work together with all Member States and to accelerate outreach towards achieving an early and meaningful reform of the Security Council.
They expressed determination to redouble their efforts towards securing concrete outcomes during the 70th session of the General Assembly.
In his remarks at the special session, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for new initiatives in all areas of governance, using space technology applications.

Indeed, there are many Devs, but only one Maha-Dev.
There are many Mantras, but the Mantra which is identified with Lord Shiva, is called Maha-Mrityunjayi Mantra.
Maha-Shivratri celebrations go on for the entire night.
This symbolizes a spirit of vigilance- that we have to protect nature and mould our activities in sync with our ecological surroundings.
From Somnath to Vishwanath, from Kedarnath to Rameshwaram and from Kashi to Coimbatore where we have gathered, Lord Shiva is everywhere.
Like crores of Indians across the length and breadth of the nation, I too feel delighted to be a part of celebrations of Maha-Shivratri.
And we are merely drops in the ocean.
Through centuries, there have lived countless devotees, in every age and time.
Standing here before this 112-feet face of Adiyogi and the Yogeshwar Linga, we are experiencing a colossal presence enveloping everyone in this space.
In the times to come, the place where we have gathered is going to be a source of inspiration for all, a place to immerse one’s self and discover truth. ये स्‍थान सबको शिवमय होने के लिए प्रेरित करता रहेगा।
It will remind us of the inclusive spirit of Lord Shiva.
The essence of Yoga has not changed.
And I say this because it is of utmost importance to preserve this essence.
Oneness with our families, with the society we live in, with fellow humans, with all the birds, animals and trees with whom we share our beautiful planet…this is Yoga.
India is a land of unparalleled diversity.
Shiv and Parvati… this is by itself a message of oneness.
And look at how this message of oneness further manifests itself:
Around the neck of Lord Shiva, there is a snake.
The ‘Vahan’ of Lord Ganesh is the mouse.
We are well aware of the frosty relations between a snake and a mouse.
Yet, they live together.
Similarly, the ‘Vahan’ of Kartikeya is the peacock.
Peacocks and snakes are supposed to harbor great enmity.
Even then, they live together.
The family of Lord Shiva is diverse yet the spirit of harmony and unity is vibrant.
Diversity is not a cause of conflict for us.
We accept it and embrace it whole heartedly.
It is a speciality of our culture that wherever there is a God or Goddess, there is either an animal, a bird or a tree that is associated with him or her.
That animal, bird or tree is also worshipped with the same spirit as the God or Goddess.
Nature equals to God, this has been firmly established by our ancestors, showing their foresight.
We have been living these virtues since our childhood and that is why compassion, kindness, brotherhood and harmony are naturally a part of us.
Unfortunately, there are a select few, who in order to hide their own ignorance, take a very rigid view and destroy any scope of welcoming new thoughts and experiences.
The progress of humanity is incomplete without the empowerment of women.
The issue is no longer women development but it is women-led development.
I am proud of the fact that in our culture the role of women is central.
Our culture has so many Goddesses who are worshipped.
India is home to many women saints, who led the movements for social reform be it in the north, south, east or west.
It would be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.
You may see people twist and turn their bodies in many sorts of fashion.
But they are not all yogis.
Be it Korea or Canada, Sweden or South Africa- in every part of the world the rays of the sun were welcomed by Yogis, engaged in the practice of Yoga.
One truly remarkable thing that Sadhguru has done is he has made yogis out of ordinary, common people.
People who stay with their families and work in the world, but who are living at the peaks within themselves – undergoing intense and wonderful experiences on a daily basis.
Wherever one is, in whatever situation one is placed, one can be a yogi.
I see so many radiant and joyous faces here.
I see people working with utmost love and care, paying attention to the smallest of details.
My gratitude to Sadhguru for bringing this to us.
In this connection, the following decisions were also taken:-
a) Taking over of 11.25 acres of land of the Government of Andhra Pradesh underneath the existing Highway passing through Naval land at Kakinada.

The re-routing of state highway at Kakinada will provide hindrance free training by reducing accidents and improvement in security of the establishment.
It will ensure safety and security of Amphibious Warfare Training Centre alongwith related infrastructure.
He offered his best wishes for the successful conduct of the forthcoming Urs.

Excellency Hadid Adel ,the Head of Farhingstan
Dr Janati, the Minister of Cultural Affairs of Iran,
Distinguished scholars,
Ladies and gentlemen
The wise words of Dr. Adel and Dr. Janati before me have set the tone for this Conference.
It is also a perfect response to the those who preach radical thoughts in our societies.
It also fulfils a responsibility to familiarize our younger generations with the beauty and riches of our cultural heritage.
No one is more qualified to shoulder this task than this gathering of learned men and scholars.
I must particularly congratulate Dr. Adel, who has been ahead of the curve in realizing this need.
His ongoing project to bring out Encyclopaedia on the Indian sub-continent in Persian would be of great service to researchers and scholars.
It is indeed an honour and privilege to be amidst such a galaxy of scholars and thinkers of Iran.
But, India and Iran are two civilizations that celebrate the meeting of our great cultures.
The rare Persian manuscript Kalileh-wa-Dimneh, released just now, captures the close historical links between India and Iran.
It is remarkable how the simple stories of the Indian classics of Jataka and Panchatantra became the Persian Kalileh-wa-Dimneh.
Centuries of free exchange of ideas and traditions, poets and craftsmen, art and architecture, culture and commerce have enriched both our civilizations.
Our heritage has also been a source of strength and economic growth for our nations.
And, a slice of Indian heritage is woven into the Iranian society.
Our ancient heroes and epics bear striking parallels.
The dargahs of Azmer Sharif and Hazrat Nizamuddin in India are equally revered in Iran.
Mahabharata and Shahnama, Bhima and Rustam, Arjuna and Arsh exhibit similarity in our world views and values.
Crafts like Zardozi, Guldozi and Chanderi may be a part of the Iranian society.
They are equally common in India too.
In the richness of Iranian culture, who can forget the poetry and beauty of its vehicle—the Persian language.
In India, we regard it as one of our own.
The great medieval poets of India have called the Persian and Sanskrit the two sisters.
India’s religious epic Ramayana which has seen over a dozen translations in Persian is known to have about 250 words of Persian.
It served as a court language in medieval India.
But, its popularity is also because it is written on the hearts of the Indians.
It is taught in around 40 universities in India.
All India Radio has been running the Persian language service for last 75 years.
India has a proud collection of almost 5 million manuscripts of Persian in public and private collections.
There are more than 20 million documents in Persian in National and State Archives.
Many of these have common heritage as they were written by Iranian calligraphers and painted by Indian artists.
In Salar Jung museum in Hyderabad, such a combination can be found in many manuscripts.
A major effort to digitize all manuscripts, including Persian is currently underway in India.
Every year, the President of India has conferred awards on the Persian Scholars.
As two ancient civilizations, we are known for our ability to be inclusive and welcoming to foreign cultures.
Sufism a rich product of our ancient links, carried its message of true love, tolerance and acceptance to the entire mankind.
The spirit of Sufism is also reflected in the Indian concept of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, the World as one family.
India and Iran have always been partners and friends.
Our historical ties may have seen their share of ups and downs.
But, throughout our partnership has remained a source of boundless strength for both of us.
Time has come for us to regain the past glory of traditional ties and links.
Time has come for us to march together.
In this endeavour, you, the eminent scholars have a defining role to play.
It is indeed my great pleasure to inaugurate the Conference “India and Iran, Two Great Civilizations: Retrospect and Prospects.”
In extending my best wishes for the success of your conference, I would also keenly look to receive the ideas that emerge out of your discussions.
I am happy to see that ICCR and Farhangistan have worked closely to organize this Conference.

Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for hosting this Summit.
I convey our deepest appreciation for the excellent arrangements and hospitality; and, for your leadership of ASEAN and East Asia Summit.
Rising from a double tragedy, Malaysia has demonstrated its resilience and resolve.
Kuala Lumpur is a symbol of Asian resurgence and of the region’s promising future.
Congratulations on a historic milestone – the birth of the ASEAN Community.
As always, ASEAN is providing both inspiration and leadership for regional cooperation and integration.
And, from India’s perspective, ASEAN values and leadership will remain central to integration across Asia and Pacific.
Excellencies, I am delighted to return for my second ASEAN-India Summit.
At the last Summit at Nay Pyi Taw, I saw the strength of our relationship and the potential of our partnership; and, even more important, the commitment and confidence that you showed for the India-ASEAN Strategic Partnership.
We meet at a time of multiple global challenges: economic uncertainties, political turmoil and security threats.
In this difficult moment, India and ASEAN are two bright spots of optimism.
India is today the fastest growing major economy in the world.
The growth rate is touching 7.5 %, and is likely to go higher.
Our inflation is down as also our fiscal and external deficits.
And, business and international confidence has increased sharply.
The scale of transformation in India is vast; so, the size of economic opportunities in India are huge.
And, we now have environment that is open and welcoming.
This is reflected in the sharp jump in India’s ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business.
And, we will continue with our reforms with speed and boldness.
ASEAN’s economy continues to forge ahead with dynamism and energy.
I have no doubt that we will reinforce prosperity for our 1.9 billion people.
I am pleased that after a temporary decline, our trade increased to about 76.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2014-15; and, so has investment in both directions.
ASEAN remains the largest investment partner – both for inward and outward flows.
Much of the potential for economic partnership remains untapped.
I am confident that our trade and investment will expand, as our economies grow.
We can also draw confidence from the progress in our framework of cooperation.
The entry into force of our Trade in Services and Investment Agreements in July 2015 is a major step forward.
We also look forward to progress in negotiations for a balanced and ambitious Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement that covers goods and services as well as investments.
Connectivity is the pathway to shared prosperity.
As in the past, we place special emphasis on our partnership with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.
Our partnership with them in capacity building projects will expand.
We will enlarge the ASEAN-India Science and Technology Development Fund from the current one million U.S. dollars to 5 million U.S. dollars.
We also intend to set up an ASEAN-India Innovation Platform to facilitate commercialization of low cost technologies, technology transfer and collaborative R&D projects.
Our cooperative project in Space, to be located in Vietnam, is now making concrete progress.
I also propose that we cooperate in sustainable development of Ocean or Blue Economy.
This will be an increasingly important driver of our future economy, and a source of food security, medicines and clean energy.
India has entered into collaboration with a number of ocean states.
Excellencies, we would also be happy to offer over 100 training slots in renewable energy in our institutions.
I have also proposed an international solar alliance of 122 solar-rich countries, which French President Hollande and I will launch in Paris on November 30.
We look forward to your participation in the launch and the alliance.
I deeply value our collective efforts to revive the cultural pillar of our relations.
An international conference on ASEAN-India Cultural Links was held in New Delhi in July.
We are proposing to open an ASEAN Studies Centre in our North-Eastern Hill University in Shillong, which is our Gateway to the East.
I am delighted that the first recipient of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations Distinguished Alumni Award instituted this year is H.E. Le Luong Minh, Secretary General of ASEAN.
India will soon extend electronic-visa facility to all 10 ASEAN countries.
Our future prosperity rests on the foundation of security and stability in our region and the oceans, outer space and cyber world.
The first ASEAN-India Cyber Security Conference we hosted in January 2015 should be the springboard for greater cooperation in this area.
We should evolve specific plans of cooperation in maritime security, counter-piracy and humanitarian and disaster relief.
Terrorism has emerged as a major global challenge that affects us all here.
We have excellent bilateral cooperation with ASEAN members.
Let me conclude by thanking Your Excellencies for your presence and by reaffirming that India attaches the highest priority to this partnership.
In recognition of that, we have opened a permanent mission to ASEAN in Jakarta.
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on how we can further develop our collaborative agenda.

Giving tips to the OTs on how to prepare for their life immediately after the end of the training, the Prime Minister said that they must always be alert and attentive to the people around them.

The Prime Minister stressed on the importance of jan-bhagidaari, or public participation, for policy initiatives to be successfully implemented.
The Prime Minister said that before independence, the Civil Services were tasked with the objective of preserving the British Raj.
Now, he said, the objective of the Civil Services is the prosperity and well-being of the people.
He said if civil servants imbibe these objectives, the gap between Government machinery and the people can be bridged.
The Prime Minister said that the problem of silos, and lack of team spirit among civil servants, can be effectively tackled during the initial training at Mussoorie.
Referring to the trek performed by OTs during the Foundation Course, the Prime Minister asked them to imbibe the learnings of the trek, such as team spirit and leadership, and apply them throughout their careers.
The Prime Minister said that social movements can drive change in a democracy, and the civil services should be catalysts for the same.
Referring to the devotional song “Vaishnav Jan”, performed by OTs during the cultural programme yesterday, the Prime Minister said that the OTs should contemplate on the lyrics of this song, after replacing the words “Vaishnav Jan” with “Civil Servant.”

He compared the civil services to the fourth lion of the Ashoka Emblem, which remains invisible, yet makes its presence felt at all times.
The Prime Minister said travel is a great Indian tradition, and travelling and interacting with people is a great learning experience.
He urged OTs to tour the field areas, during their postings.
Exhorting the OTs, the Prime Minister said that the “sense of career,” which had successfully brought them to LBSNAA, should now be replaced by a “sense of mission” – to serve the people of India.

Earlier this morning, the Prime Minister participated in the Yoga session of the Officer Trainees, held in the lawns of the Academy, in the backdrop of the Himalayas.

Development and prosperity of Pune Metropolitan Area will also contribute to the prosperity and development of the nation.
Project will be covered under the legal framework of the Metro Railways (Construction of Works) Act, 1978; the Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002; and the Railways Act, 1989, as amended from time to time.

Both the cantonment areas namely Pune and Khadki have witnessed rapid growth of population.
The population of Pune Urban Agglomeration was 4.99 million as per 2011 census compared to 3.57 million in 2001 census.
This is further projected to increase to 6.90 million in 2021 and 7.73 million in 2031.
Rapid industrialization and intense commercial developments in the past decades have resulted in steep rise in travel demand, putting Pune’s transport infrastructure to stress.
With the growing economy and inadequate public transport services, the passengers will shift to private modes, which is already evident from the high vehicle ownership trend in the region.
Hence, Metro Rail System has become essential.

Namashkar, Dignitaries and invitees assembled in New York State for the inauguration of the Nature Cure Centre, viewers watching this event online and on television.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Greetings on the occasion of International Yoga Day!
This morning, I was delighted to join thousands of people from different walks of life, to celebrate this occasion, in the beautiful city of Dehradun, in the foot-hills of the Himalayas.
For the last few days, I have been seeing pictures of people participating in the celebrations, across the world.
Indeed, in just three years, this event has grown into a world-wide public movement.
It has become an integral part of public life in many countries.
Its impact has expanded far beyond its day of observance.
In India, I perceive three different themes in the observation of International Day of Yoga.
I am sure, this is the case in many other countries as well.
First, it has become an occasion of initiation for millions.
Inspired by the spirit of Yoga, they commit themselves to its pursuit.
Second, it is an occasion when those, who are already introduced to Yoga, re-dedicate themselves to its pursuit.
The third theme is to spread the good word.
Thousands of individuals and institutions, who have already gained from Yoga, reach out to those that still have not.
In the process, International Day of Yoga, has even come to be celebrated as a festival, by many across the world.
The word Yoga, means ‘to unite’.
Therefore, this surge of interest in Yoga, fills me with hope.
I hope that Yoga can become a binding force for the world.
I am happy that you have chosen the International Day of Yoga, for the inauguration of this Nature Cure Centre.
I hope that this Centre shall strive to strongly integrate elements of Yoga, in all its programmes and initiatives.
Traditional Indian knowledge systems, such as Yoga and Ayurveda, help us stay healthy.
Modern lifestyle takes a toll on the body as well as the mind.
The focus of conventional systems of healthcare, unfortunately, is more on cure, rather than on prevention.
There is no denying that we need conventional medicine to address the huge health challenges of today.
But it is also a fact that there are gap areas that remain un-addressed.
Healthcare specialists all over the world now appreciate the fact that systems like Yoga and Ayurveda can complement the conventional medicine system extremely well.
These holistic systems focus on wellness and disease prevention.
Adoption of these holistic practices leads to increased health and wellness in individuals and in communities.
Contrary to the perception of some people, Yoga is not limited to exercises and postures .
It involves a deep search into mind, body and spirit.
It leads to a greater understanding of one-self.
This leads further to social discipline, and in turn to ethics and enduring values of life.
Yoga is a deep philosophy that can help us to walk on the path of salvation or freedom from worries.
I have always believed that Yoga has no religion.
It contains practical steps which can benefit everyone, even those who do not consider themselves religious.
Modern Yoga practices often include various elements of ancient wisdom.
These include moral and ethical principles, postures designed to keep the body fit, spiritual philosophy, instruction by a guru, chanting of mantras, quieting the breath and stilling the mind through meditation.
Experts of Yoga see its daily practice as beneficial in itself, leading to improved health, emotional well-being, mental clarity and joy in living.
The belief that certain yogic postures and Pranayama help to control many diseases has been widely held in India for centuries.
Now, modern science has stepped in to generate supporting evidence for this.
Science has also demonstrated that through Yoga, it is possible to exercise control over the functions of many organs in the body including heart, brain, and endocrine glands.
Today, interest in Yoga is growing rapidly in Western countries.
It would be no exaggeration to say that Yoga has been appreciated a lot by the Western world.
I am told that in USA alone, more than 20 million people are practicing Yoga and that this number is increasing at an average of five percent every year.
Several modern medical institutes of USA and Europe have adopted Yoga as an alternative or adjunct treatment for many disorders.
Of late, a lot of research has been undertaken in Yoga.
The Government of India is committed to implement evidence based traditional systems of healthcare in public health.
Our National Health Policy, announced last year, strongly focuses on the prevention of diseases.
We have also launched nation-wide programmes for the prevention and control of non communicable diseases.
India is a big country with the world’s second largest population.
The initiatives taken today may take some years to show results, but I am confident that tangible results will soon become visible.
It is also significant that their objective is life-long wellness.
I assume that respect for authenticity and faith in scientific approach are inherent to these objectives.
With such an approach, the Centre can contribute significantly to the wellness movement, and take the benefits of Yoga to a large number of people in the USA.
It also gives me happiness to learn that your Centre will create five hundred direct and fifteen hundred indirect jobs in the area.
It will thus be a responsible member of the community.
I wish you all the very best for this venture.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said there can be no bigger inspiration than Mahatma Gandhi, for pursuing the vision of Swachh Bharat.
In his remarks at the Safaigiri Summit and Awards 2015, organized by the India Today group, the Prime Minister said that over the last one year, a lot of people had contributed towards this vision.
The Prime Minister especially highlighted the positive and proactive role played by electronic media in this regard.
The Prime Minister said Swachhta or cleanliness is a matter of habit.
Once this habit is inculcated, an individual cannot tolerate an unclean environment.
He said that while India has been a very conscious society in terms of personal hygiene, social hygiene had been neglected.
This needed to be corrected, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said that upto 1000 children die daily in India, due to unhygienic conditions.
He said that Swachh Bharat cannot be seen as merely a Government programme.
He said this was everyone’s programme.
If 125 crore people decide that India must be clean, it can be ensured, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister commended the efforts of the award winners, and said their work would serve as inspiration for many others.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Financial Services Commission (FSC), Gibraltar for mutual co-operation and technical assistance.
The MoU is likely to promote further development of economic links and cooperation between the two regulators and aims at creating conditions for an effective development of securities markets in the two countries.
It would also contribute towards strengthening the information sharing framework between the two signatories.
Together with the earlier decision, this is expected to transform the spectrum usage in the telecom sector.
The salient features of the norms for spectrum trading shall include:-
(3). The seller shall clear all his dues prior to entering into any agreement for spectrum trading.
Thereafter, any dues recoverable up to the effective date of transfer shall be the liability of the buyer.
(5). Spectrum Trading shall be permitted only on a pan-LSA (Licensed Service Area) basis.
In case the spectrum assigned to the seller is restricted to part of the LSA by the Licensor, then, after trading, the rights and obligations of the seller for the remaining part of the LSA with regard to assignment of that spectrum shall also stand transferred to the buyer.
Further, relevant provisions of NIA with respect to spectrum assignment in part of the LSA, which were applicable to seller before the spectrum trade, will apply to buyer subsequent to the spectrum trade.
(6). All access spectrum bands earmarked for Access Services by the Licensor will be treated as tradable spectrum bands.
(7). Only that spectrum in the specified bands is permissible to be traded which has either been assigned through an auction in the year 2010 or afterwards, or on which the Telecom Service Provider (TSP) has already paid the prescribed market value (as decided by the Government from time to time) to the Government.
(15). A non-refundable transfer fee of one percent of the transactional amount or one percent of the prescribed market price, whichever is higher shall be imposed on all spectrum trade transactions, to cover the administrative charges incurred by Government in servicing the trade.
The transfer fee shall be paid by the buyer (transferee) to the Government.
The amount received from trading shall be part of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) for the purpose of levy of License fee and Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC).
(16). Frequency swapping/reconfiguration from within the assignments made to the licensees will not be treated as trading of spectrum.
The conditions in the NIA shall govern frequency swapping/reconfiguration.
(17). Existing rates as prescribed by the Government from time to time for Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) shall continue to apply on spectrum held by the buyer which inter alia includes the spectrum acquired through trading.
Spectrum acquired through spectrum trading will be treated akin to spectrum acquired through auction.
(18). Both the licensees trading the spectrum shall jointly give a prior intimation for trading the right to use the spectrum at least 45 days before the proposed effective date of the trading.
Both the licensees shall also give an undertaking that they are in compliance with all the terms and conditions of guidelines for spectrum trading and the licence conditions.
This also facilitates ease of doing business in India by allowing free play in the commercial decisions and leads to optimisation of resources.
This will fulfil the present Government’s commitment of ease of doing business apart from improving the spectral efficiency and quality of service which is very essential to fulfil the dream of digital India.
Historically, in most countries, the Telecom sector was a highly regulated sector where the Government used to decide the procedure for allocation of spectrum.
Recognising the benefits of telecommunication facilities, over the past two decades, there has been growing consensus that because of significant increase in the demand for spectrum, the prevalent regulatory paradigm would prove inadequate to deal with the situation on hand.
Licensed Service Providers need flexibility to respond quickly to changes in the market demand and technology.
In India the spectrum assignment is made for a period of 20 years.
During this period, some operators are able to acquire subscribers and grow at a faster rate as compared to other operators.
Therefore, Spectrum Sharing and Spectrum Trading are necessary to make up the inadequacy.
It will not only improve the quality of service and but also help address the issue of call drops.
Spectrum trading allows parties to transfer their spectrum rights and obligations to another party.
Digital Platform for National Agriculture Market to be launched on Babasaheb Ambedkar’s birth anniversary on April 14th
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today unveiled the operational guidelines for the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana at a massive farmers’ rally in Sehore in Madhya Pradesh.

Your Excellency Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha Ladies and Gentlemen
From the Legend of Rama to the Wisdom of Buddha our ties are founded on a shared cultural heritage.
Our historical people-to-people ties provide a strong basis to our partnership.
Thailand is a trusted and valued friend, and one of our closest partners in Southeast Asia.
We are both aware that rapid spread of terrorism and radical ideology poses a common challenge to both our societies.
And, we also recognize that our close security partnership would help us to secure our peoples from these threats.
In our shared objective to combat these challenges, India is particularly grateful to Thailand for its assistance and cooperation.
In this context, we welcome the first meeting of the India-Thailand Joint Business Forum to be held later today.
We encourage them, and the other business-sector stakeholders, to take lead in tapping the emerging business opportunities in both our countries.
Alongside trade, there are also ample avenues for greater manufacturing and investment linkages.
We see a particular synergy between Thai strengths in infrastructure, particularly tourism infrastructure, and India’s priorities in this field.
Information Technology, pharmaceuticals, auto-components, and machinery are some other areas of promising collaboration.
Next year, to commemorate the seventy years of establishment of our diplomatic relations, we will celebrate Festival of India in Thailand, and Festival of Thailand in India.
This year, India is also celebrating one hundred and twenty-fifth birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of Indian Constitution.
I am delighted that the Indian Constitution will soon be translated into Thai language.
We look forward to welcoming her in India again later this year.
We also look forward to the honour of receiving His Royal Highness Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn in India at his earliest convenience.
In conclusion, let me say that the convergence of Thailand’s ‘Look West’, and India’s ‘Act East’ policy lights the path to a bright future of our partnership.
How are you ?
Present here on the dais, Chief minister Shri Vijaybhai, Deputy chief minister Shri Nitin Bhai, Former chief minister Anandiben, Members of the Council of ministers of the state, my colleagues in the Union Council of ministers, Members of Parliament, Mayor and my brothers and sisters present here in large numbers.
Nyari Ki Baat Nyari, Aji Kare Razi (Nyari is unique and Aji can make you to agree).
When I took over as the chief minister of Gujarat in 2001, shortly thereafter I got a call from Rajkot that Aji Dam had become full and you must visit here.
The people became used to it.
No problem, we will manage when the next week a tanker would come.
From there where has Gujarat now come to!
The today’s youth of Gujarat who are in the age group of 15-17 and the generations to come after them would not know what was the situation in Gujarat earlier?
People were desperate for electricity.
When the electricity would be available?
If a farmer wanted to run water pump in the field then they did not use to sleep through the night so that they can be informed when electricity is available to run the pumps to irrigate their fields.
There is no reason to forget those days.
How far we have come, how hard we have worked, with what kind of good intention, with what kind of sacrifices we have achieved this, we can only understand all this when we understand the difficulties faced by our parents in the earlier time.
What else could be the reason that compelled people to leave Kutch, Kathiawad and settle in slums across the country?
And it was not long time ago, this was the reality of Gujarat twenty years ago.
I don’t want to dwell who was responsible for this.
However, since the time the people of Gujarat gave us the opportunity to serve them, be it the leadership of Keshubhai Patel or of Anandiben Patel or of Vijay Bhai Rupani or when I had the opportunity to serve you as your servant; during this entire period, we moved from heaven to earth to give water to the people of Gujarat , to give them electricity, to lay roads to the villages.
I don’t have any reasons to feel tired as the people of the country, people of Gujarat, people of Rajkot continue to shower me with so much love.
I still remember as explained by Nitin Bhai that when I had started Sauni Scheme in Haimu, Gadhvi Hol and Rajkot then I had explained it to everyone by making a power point presentation.
I still remember that so many questions were raised.
It is not doable and Modi is talking about this as elections are round the corner.
How such a massive fund will be arranged, how so many pipelines will be laid?
And nothing will take place till 2040.
It’s not raining with the full force yet, the land has become wet only and water is rushing to Aji with full force.
And look at the science, technology and capacity that water has been supplied from a distance of 470 kilometers.
And we have taken the water to Narmada dam, at a height equivalent to that of a 65 story building.
This science has its own uniqueness.
Water could only be supplied to your homes when we took the water at a height equivalent to the height of a 65 story building.
This entire scheme is a good example of money being well spent.
And the work of Sardar Sarovar Dam was finished just 10 days ago.
Chief Minister and his colleagues closed the doors of the dam.
The work of doors was completed during the tenure of Anandiben, even then hurdles remained there.
Who were the trouble makers it will be known to everyone when the history of Narmada will be written.
And I’d like to request to the people of Rajkot and Saurashtra that we should not forget how we came out of those difficulties.
We must save water.
Ninety years ago this great soul had predicted that water will be sold in shops.
And now we have enough water for drinking when Rakjot is moving in the direction to become smart city.
At this time an important task of managing waste water is before Rajkot.
The water that drains into gutter, we must recycle that water for other usage within Rajkot like it should be used in factories, in gardens and also in construction industry.
And that is why it will not be difficult for us to have quality drinking water.
Generally, the government officers, the bureaucrats who have been working with government for years have developed a feeling that we know everything.
The God has gifted us all the wisdom.
They have a feeling that they know solutions for every problem.
This was common in the past.
However, I have changed this perception.
Sometime back I asked the departments of government of India to prepare a list of the tasks that are difficult to execute, tasks which require more efforts, more time and more money.
However, I relentlessly pursued this matter with them.
They identified 500 issues where they felt the need to rethink.
I organized a hakathon.
What should the municipal corporation of Rajkot do to make it a smart city?
How to increase people’s participation?
How to solve the traffic problems, how to develop a system for payment of taxes?
What should be done to bring about the changes in poor people’s lives?
Thousands of youth are eager to participate in this hackothon beginning on 29 July.
How to change the face of Rajkot, how to modernize the system of Rajkot, this is going to be done by our college going young generation.
I salute their energy and enthusiasm.
With these good wishes I express my gratitude to all of you.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today declared that the respect for armed forces veterans and those who laid down their lives for the nation is paramount for the country.
Recalling his promise of delivering One-Rank, One-Pension for the armed forces personnel, the Prime Minister said the Union Government had fulfilled this promise, with the announcement made yesterday.
He said that the cost of implementing this promise would be around Rs. 8000 crore to Rs. 10,000 crore, which was significantly higher than some estimates that had been made earlier.
The Prime Minister was speaking after inaugurating the Badarpur-Faridabad Metro Line at Faridabad.
The Prime Minister regretted that it had become a fashion to politicize every decision taken by the Union Government for the progress of the country.
Asserting that no one should mislead the jawans and the people of the nation, the Prime Minister said that the country would progress not through Raj-neeti (politics), but through Rashtra-neeti (nationalist policies).
The Prime Minister said that a significant proportion of army jawans were from Haryana, and therefore, the announcement of OROP would contribute significantly to Haryana’s economy.
Reiterating that development is the solution to all problems, the Prime Minister said the Union Government is taking all steps for India’s development.
He said the whole world had recently faced economic difficulties, but India’s economy had stood firm.
He added that all State Governments and the Union Government had to move forward shoulder to shoulder.
He reiterated his Government’s resolve for Housing for All by 2022.
The Prime Minister travelled from Central Delhi to Faridabad, and back, by metro.
This will provide a more efficient, flexible and dynamic policy for crude procurement, eventually benefiting the consumers.
The existing policy for import of crude oil was approved by the Cabinet in the year 1979.
In 2001, the Cabinet approved some amendment to the policy.
While the current policy has ensured that collective energy needs of Oil PSUs are consistently met over the years, the policy needs to evolve with the changing times.
With the changing geo-political environment, the crude oil import policy needs to be modified to bring it in tune with current needs.
The current market practices for purchase of crude oil on spot basis also need to be adopted to compete effectively in the market.
After the last decision of the Cabinet in 2001, the Govt. of India has delegated substantial powers to Navaratna and Maharatna companies among PSUs.
Such companies are given high degree of autonomy in various operational, financial and investment matters.
Accordingly, the Cabinet has approved that the Oil PSUs of the Govt. of India shall be empowered to evolve their own policies for import of crude oil, consistent with CVC guidelines and get them approved by the respective Boards.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of soldiers in Siachen.

If there is a strong force that bring a change in the lives of those on the margins it is technology.”
Youngsters are enthusiastic, industry is supportive and the government is proactive.
India is yearning for a digital revolution.”
It is egalitarian and inclusive.
PM on mobile governance:
“M-governance is empowered governance.
It has the potential to make development a truly inclusive and comprehensive mass movement.
It puts governance into everyone’s reach.
It puts governance in your hands 24/7.”
Several big companies today are startups of yesterday.”
“We want India to emerge as the Innovation Hub where the next big ideas emerge, driven by the power of technology.”
Several Tweets and Posts have been shared.
At the same time, letters from the previous ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on technology and digital India were referred.
Here is the text of the dialogue:
Q1 – A very common question across social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)- The Digital India week has been launched.
Has the response been encouraging and up to your expectations?
The entire Nation has joined hands to make the dream of a Digital India into a reality.
India is yearning for a digital revolution.
When the Digital India initiative was launched, the fervour was unimaginable and unprecedented.
Most notably, several job opportunities will be created for our people.
Never before has something been planned at such a large scale.
I want to add that this dream will be fulfilled not by the Central Government or the private sector alone.
They shared ideas for citizen-centric services from the national till the Panchayat level. @RishiBagree highlighted an App on waste management. @rangats and @kumawatraj have talked about PDS improvement and electronic ration cards.
I want to tell everyone – our quest for a Digital India is all encompassing.
It is going to touch your lives in several ways, making it easier.
For instance, the Digital Locker and e-Sign will manage all key documents with ease and efficiency.
Documents can be accessed at a click and that too without being inconvenienced.
Take healthcare- eHospital would mean no more wasting time standing in hospital lines.
Instead, there is online registration for appointment, online payment and online reports. @microrao asked me about an online portal where information and prices of drugs and medicine will be made available.
He will be happy to know that DeitY is actively working on this.
The National Scholarship Portal brings together all scholarship schemes under a single application form.
Thus, you will have one convenient platform to search the right scholarship, filling several forms and tracking their progress.
The real strength of these initiatives will come when they are extensively used.
More usage will enable them to become mature and world class.
That is why, I urge everyone to use these innovative services as much as possible.
For instance, think of paying the salary of your support staff from your mobile to their Jan Dhan accounts.
Similarly, keep using these services in as many ways as possible.
Q2- @BGMahesh (BG Mahesh) asked – what is your tech routine.
In what ways in technology a part of your life.
This is a question many people ask me when I meet them.
They ask me about technology, what mobile phone I use, how often I check my mail.
Technology for me is- discover, learn, evolve and implement.
It combines 3Ss- speed, simplicity and service.
The more we learn about technology and the more we learn through technology, the better it is.
Technology enthuses the world.
Like any common person, I scan my mails and try to be as regular in correspondence (by my own standards I am still slow).
Technology makes access to information a lot faster.
I am able to access news on the go.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I sit down with top officials during the PRAGATI sessions and we cover substantial ground in a wide range of sectors.
We are already seeing the difference this can make.
Technology transforms people’s lives.
From mitigating poverty to simplifying processes, ending corruption to providing better services, Technology is omnipresent.
It has become the single-most important instrument of human progress.
Technology is here to stay.
The future of technology lies in its humanization.
Technology on a day-to-day basis is getting adaptive to human emotions, preferences and choices.
To me technology used wisely is a catalyst to magically transforming the way we live.
Q3- @ramyavenugopal (Ramya Venugopal) asked- You are active on ‪@LinkedIn with a vibrant following.
How has social media helped u connect better with people?
The future belongs to social media.
A great example is the recent #SelfieWithDaughter trend.
People from Africa, Europe, the Americas, South Asian neighbours shared selfies taken with their daughters.
Physical distance was rendered irrelevant.
One Vietnamese person shared his memories of India and I got an opportunity to talk to that person on Twitter.
My being on social media has enriched me in many ways.
After a long day at work, I log on to social media and it is very very refreshing.
I am active on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn and Instagram.
It gives me a pulse of what people think.
I get a lot of feedback.
For example, someone tweeted to me that during one of the speeches I spoke too fast.
It acts as a mirror for all of us in our otherwise very busy lives.
I am a firm believer in the use of social media.
It has given voice to the common man.
That is when you will understand the power of that medium and you will be able to make a difference.
Q4- Narayan Reddy from Andhra Pradesh wrote: There is a sense that technology further empowers those who are already empowered.
How can technology change the lives of people on the margins? @RupamG (Rupam Ghatak) asks – rural India needs better internet penetration, how can digital India achieve that?
Technology empowers the less empowered.
If there is a strong force that bring a change in the lives of those on the margins it is technology.
It serves as a leveler and a springboard.
Take for instance the farmer.
Technology can make agriculture productive, prosperous and profitable.
We have seen this worldwide.
Just recently, the Cabinet cleared the Scheme of Promotion of National Agriculture Market through Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund.
585 regulated markets across India will be integrated with common e-platform.
Farmers & traders can get opportunities to purchase & sell agricultural commodities at optimal prices in a transparent manner.
Small entrepreneurs not having abundant capital, get a chance to create value, through technology.
Our handicraft workers who were dependent on seasonal tourist flow, can now sell their products across the world with a single click.
Aggregators of various kinds have given a fresh lease of life to thousands of people across our country.
Be it retail, tourism, transport, food industry, technology has given a new platform to thousands of people, most of who are on the margins.
I want to share a small story.
As CM, I went to a tribal area of Kaprada in Valsad district for inaugurating a chilling centre in a dairy.
While returning from the venue after the function, I saw nearly three-fourth of the women clicking photos from their mobiles.
They said we will get the photographs transferred to a computer and later get the printouts.
These are women who never attended school or college where they could learn what to do with photographs clicked with a mobile.
But they know that the photo can be transferred to a computer and later be collected in the form of a printout from the computer.
This is how technology has reached out to people on its own even at the margins.
India offers the complete package.
And the best part is- this is driven by the youth.
This is drawing the interest of the world and has energized people across India.
This is convergence for you.
Exuberance & Talent of our youth is finding an outlet of expression through technology.
Here, I want to point to our MyGov experience.
It gives people the opportunity to contribute to Nation building through technology.
Many of the ideas we have got through MyGov are brilliant.
Q6- @MonicaBhatia (Monia Bhatia) asked- Despite high penetration of Internet, many are still not digitally literate.
How do you plan to spread digital literacy.
I don’t see it as being limited to digital literacy.
The larger point lies in encouraging people to use technology.
In some cases the problem is access.
In some cases it is lack of adequate guidance.
In some cases it may even be offering the technology the person needs.
We are attending to all these challenges.
Once we increase access to technology, the challenge of digital literacy will be mitigated.
I feel our emphasis on mobile governance will be a game changer as far as increasing technology penetration is concerned.
A robust choice architecture implies producers are constantly innovating and consumers have a gamut of products and services to chose from.
There will be something for everything.
It is important to harness technology in totality.
In the past we have seen use of technology in isolation.
The power of technology lies in convergence.
Convergence brings convenience and this increases usage.
We want to give every Indian a unique digital identity.
In the past, there have been too many digital identities for every person.
Every service has it’s own requirement and every service has its own database.
All of this is happening due to the alternatives technology offers to our lives today.
I am confident that Indians will be second to none in their embrace of technology in all aspects of their lives in the years to come.
Q7- Chandan Kumar from Bihar asked- What impact will technology and automation have on India considering a huge low skilled base?
Technology has time and again created opportunities for a whole new generation of Jobs and Industries.
I have been studying with great interest what is happening around the world.
We are seeing the advent of a new generation of Machines.
Some are calling it the next Machine Age.
3D Printing, Internet of Things, Intelligent Machines and Robotics will automate many Industries.
While some see a threat I see an opportunity.
Let me explain why – we in India already have a natural advantage given our strengths in Software and Information Technology.
Hence my mantra is – don’t talk about “Digital India”, “Make in India”, “Design in India” and “Skilled India” in silos.
All of them are interrelated.
It is in the synergy across all three lies India’s Opportunity for the 21st Century.
M-governance is empowered governance.
It puts governance in your hands 24/7.
I have been saying from Day 1 that we should be working towards a ‘Mobile First’ approach.
You may have seen that all our websites are increasingly getting mobile friendly.
Innovative mobile applications have been developed that deliver end-to-end services.
We will have to take into account the popularity of mobile and smart phones while taking decisions pertaining to IT.
A decade ago and beyond, the pressing challenge was to take mobile phones to as many people as possible.
One small effort towards reaching out to the people on their mobile phones through the ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App.’
Launched a few weeks ago, the App is a one stop destination for all the latest news and updates from my side.
It allows people to directly communicate with me and gives me an opportunity to hear their insights.
Infact, the radio programme can be heard live through the App.
People can receive messages through me on the App as well.
The response to the Mobile App has made me very happy.
Q9- Ankhi Das- I compliment you for cutting through layers and reaching out to all directly and having a conversation.
I hope this is a start of the many Digital Dialogues that you will have in our country.
These 3As are important for a Digital India- Accessible, Additive and Affordable.
Access is key.
We want our 125 crore Citizens to be digitally empowered.
We already have broadband usage across India go up by 63% in the last year.
We need to accelerate this further.
The government efforts must be complemented by similar energy and proactiveness by other stakeholders.
I would also like to see the private sector become part of the efforts to ensure broadband Internet has the widest reach across India.
Our digital India initiative is about value addition.
It must enrich the lives of the people.
It must offer something unique to everyone, which can make a positive difference.
Similarly, Affordability is the third key.
Because, at the end of the day, who are we working for?
In terms of scale, extent and influence, our Digital India initiatives must be path breaking and all inclusive, laying the foundation for how we script India’s development story in the 21st Century.
Q10 – In the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ letters, Kishore Trivedi from Rajkot asked- Prime Minister, what do you feel are the major challenges in the roadmap to achieve a digital India?
When we have taken up such an ambitious initiative and that too at such a large scale, there will be several challenges.
But, we should neither underestimate these challenges nor should we get overwhelmed by them.
We must be laser focused on our Mission and that is what we are doing.
I have already talked about access and affordable access.
The second challenge is Skills and Knowledge.
We have to empower our Citizens with the skills and knowledge to use Digital Applications and Services.
We also have to volunteer time and effort to share Digital Skills so our fellow citizens who have recently been digitally empowered get to know how to use this powerful medium and are able to get the maximum out of this medium.
The third challenge is reforming the citizen government Interface and the processes of governance.
Q11- @sbikh (Sanjeev Bikhchandani) asked- What is your message to young tech entrepreneurs doing start-ups?
Startups are the engines of exponential growth, manifesting the power of innovation.
Several big companies today are startups of yesterday.
They were born with a spirit of enterprise and adventure kept alive due to hardwork and perseverance and today have become shining beacons of innovation.
Thus, my message- keep innovating.
If we don’t innovate, if we don’t come up with cutting edge products there will be stagnation.
On the part of the Government, I assure absolute support.
We are doing everything possible to make enterprise and innovation easier.
We have covered substantial ground in the last 14 months and want to do a lot more in the future.
We want India to emerge as the Innovation Hub where the next big ideas emerge, driven by the power of technology.
This will improve the quality of communication services in the Cantonments and Military Stations.

He said, that similarly, FICCI has a role to play in making GST more effective.
He said the Government’s effort is to ensure that maximum businesses register for GST.
He said the more formal the system becomes, the more it will benefit the poor.
I hope FICCI has some plan to generate large-scale awareness among small traders, he added.
He also said that FICCI must also voice concerns, when necessary, on issues such as builders exploiting the common man.
The Prime Minister mentioned policy decisions taken in sectors such as urea, textile, civil aviation, and health, and the benefits achieved from them.

Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change
Other Distinguished Dignitaries from India and Abroad
Ladies and Gentlemen.
As we celebrate this important occasion today, we recall our ancient ethos of universal brotherhood.
The same ethos was reflected in the doctrine of trustee-ship, advocated by Mahatma Gandhi.
He had said that ‘Earth provides enough to satisfy everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed.’
Our traditions have for long stressed the importance of living in harmony with nature.
This is reflected in our reverence of the elements of nature.
It is reflected in our festivals, and in our ancient texts.
India is the fastest growing economy in the world today.
We are committed to raising the standards of living of our people.
In this direction, we have given forty million new cooking gas connections in the last two years.
It has also eliminated their dependence on firewood.
It is the same commitment, which has seen over three hundred million LED bulbs being installed across India.
Besides saving electricity, this has also prevented huge additional amounts of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere.
We have targeted generation of one hundred and seventy-five GigaWatts of solar and wind energy by 2022.
We are reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
We are switching sources of fuel where possible.
We are transforming cities and public transportation.
To generate employment, we are working towards making India a global manufacturing hub.
We have launched the Make in India campaign.
While doing so, we are laying stress on zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
This means manufacturing that is without defect, and which does not harm the environment.
As part of the Nationally Determined Contributions, India is committed to reducing thirty-three to thirty-five percent of emission intensity of its GDP during 2005 to 2030.
We will reduce the emissions intensity of India’s GDP by twenty to twenty-five percent over 2005 levels by 2020.
We have a robust National Biodiversity Strategy.
With only two point four percent of the world’s land area, India supports seven to eight percent of the recorded species diversity.
At the same time, India supports nearly eighteen percent of human population.
The population of tiger, elephant, lion rhino and other forms of wildlife is on the rise.
We have launched the massive Namami Gange initiative.
This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.
India is primarily an agrarian country.
The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water.
We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients instead of burning them.
While much of the world focuses on Inconvenient Truth, we have moved on to Convenient Action.
It was this call for Convenient Action that led India, along with France, to form the International Solar Alliance.
This is perhaps, the single most important global development, towards the cause of environment, after the Paris Conference.
About three months ago, leaders from over 45 nations, and Heads of International Organizations, gathered here in New Delhi, for the Founding Conference of the International Solar Alliance.
Our experience shows that development can be environment friendly.
It need not come at the cost of our green assets.
A lot of it never makes it to the recycling bin.
Worse, a lot of it is non-bio-degradable.
Plastic pollution is already having a deadly impact on our marine ecosystem.
Scientists and fishermen alike have pointed to signs of trouble.
These include declining fish catches, warming ocean temperatures, and vanishing habitats.
Marine litter especially micro-plastic, is a major trans-boundary problem.
India is preparing to join the “Clean Seas Campaign” and make its contribution towards saving our oceans.
Our national mission on cleanliness and sanitation – Swachh Bharat Abhiyan – has a special focus on “plastic waste management.”
A short while ago, I visited the Exhibition set up by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.
Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable, the most.
It is the duty of each one of us, to ensure that the quest for material prosperity does not compromise our environment.
As part of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the world had agreed to the theme of “Leave No One Behind.”
This is not possible without ensuring that we all come together to protect what Mother Nature has given us.
This is the Indian way.
And we are happy to share it again with the international community on the auspicious occasion of World Environment Day.
In conclusion, as global host of World Environment Day 2018, I reiterate our commitment to sustainable development.
The choices may not be easy.
But through awareness, technology, and a genuine global partnership, I am sure we can make the right choices.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has expressed shock over the fire tragedy which happened at a temple in Kollam district of Kerala.

He added that today India is associated with fast economic growth and honest, transparent governance.
Prime Minister also appealed to the NRI community to work towards the dream of creating a New India.
PESO is a subordinate office under Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP).
The organization is serving the nation since 1898 as a nodal agency for regulating safety of substances such as explosives, compressed gases and petroleum.
Over the years, the role and responsibilities of PESO have increased manifold and expanded into diverse fields.
Today, the organization deals with wide range of subjects related to explosives, petroleum, compressed gases, pressure vessels, gas cylinders, cross-country pipelines, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Auto Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Auto LPG) etc.
The increase in workload is manifested in the quantum jump in the number of licensed premises and other activities.
Boost to infrastructure facilities for judiciary
Benefits from the Scheme:
The Scheme will increase the availability of suitable number of Court Halls and Residential Accommodations for Judges / Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts all over the country including at District, Sub-District, Taluka, Tehsil and Gram Panchayat and Village levels.
This will help in improving the functioning and performance of the Judiciary across the country in reaching out to every citizen.
Financial assistance:
The central assistance is provided to the State Governments / UT Administrations under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary for construction of court halls and residential units for Judicial Officers / Judges of District and Subordinate Courts.
The funds sharing pattern for Centre and State is 60:40 in respect of States other than North Eastern and Himalayan States.
The funds sharing pattern is 90:10 in respect of North Eastern and Himalayan States; and 100% in respect of Union Territories.
This will help for completion of on-going projects for construction of 3,000 court halls and 1,800 residential units for judicial officers of District and Subordinate Courts.
Monitoring of the Scheme
An on-line monitoring system will be set up by the Department of Justice enabling data collection on progress, completion of court halls and residential units under construction as well as better asset management.
Regular meetings of the Monitoring Committee may be organised in various States with State Chief Secretaries and PWD officials to enable speedy and good construction.
It may also be monitored if the funds released by the Centre are released without delay onward to PWD by the State Governments.
Central Government augments the resources of the States in this regard through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for development of infrastructure facilities for Judiciary which is being implemented since 1993-94.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the policy to permit exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons such as Shale oil/gas, Coal Bed Methane (CBM) etc.
It will be carried out under the existing Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), CBM contracts and Nomination fields to encourage the existing Contractors in the licensed/leased area to unlock the potential of unconventional hydrocarbons in the existing acreages.
This policy will enable the realization of prospective hydrocarbon reserves in the existing Contract Areas which otherwise would remain unexplored and unexploited.
With this policy dispensation, new investment in Exploration and Production (E&P) activities and chances of finding new hydrocarbon discoveries and resultant increased domestic production thereof is expected.
Exploration and exploitation of additional hydrocarbon resources is expected to spur new investment, impetus to economic activities, additional employment generation and thus benefitting various sections of society.
This will lead to induction of new, innovative and cutting-edge technology and forging new technological collaboration to exploit unconventional hydrocarbons.
As per existing contractual regime of PSCs, existing Contractors are not allowed to explore and exploit CBM or other unconventional hydrocarbons in already allotted licensed/leased area.
Similarly, CBM Contractors are not allowed to exploit any other hydrocarbon except CBM.
Acreages held at present by various Contractors in PSCs and CBM blocks and National Oil Companies (NOCs) in nomination regime constitute a significant part of India’s sedimentary basin.
In preliminary studies, ‘in place’ probable Shale gas resources in the range of 100-200 TCF in 5 Indian sedimentary basins have been assessed by various international agencies.
Presence of Shale oil/gas has a strong possibility in basins such as Cambay, Krishna- Godavari (KG), Cauvery etc. where mature organic rich Shale exist.
An area of 72,027 sq. km. held under PSCs of Pre- New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP)/NELP regime and 5269 sq. km area under CBM contracts has been opened up for simultaneous exploration and exploitation of conventional or unconventional hydrocarbons.
With the approval of this policy, there will be complete shift from ‘One hydrocarbon Resource Type’ to ‘Uniform Licensing Policy’ which is presently applicable in Hydrocarbon Exploration & Licensing Policy (HELP) and Discovered Small Field (DSF) Policy.
The fiscal and contractual terms of the policy provide for ring-fencing of Petroleum Operations and cost recovery of new hydrocarbon discoveries in PSC block.
For nomination blocks, NOCs will be allowed to explore and exploit unconventional hydrocarbons under the existing fiscal and contractual terms of exploration/lease license.
Heads of State and Health Ministers from various countries and 1200 delegates would be participating in this forum.
PMNCH is a global partnership of 92 countries and over 1000 organisations.
He suggested that we could have an online quiz competition on these themes and provide awards to prize winners in the upcoming Partners’ Forum Meeting in December 2018.

Perpetrators of Pulwama terror attack act will be punished, says PM
PM warns the perpetrators and those aiding and abetting terrorists that they have made a big mistake and will have to pay a heavy price
Free hand has been given to security forces to act:PM
PM warns Pakistan not to live in illusion that it can destabilize India
PM praises the valour and pride of Indian soldiers
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that perpetrators of Pulwama terror attack act will be punished.
He has warned the perpetrators and those aiding and abetting terrorists that they have made a big mistake and will have to pay a heavy price.
Stating that free hand has been given to the security forces to act, PM dared Pakistan not to live in illusion that it can destabilize India.
He was addressing a public gathering today before flagging off Vande Bharat Express between New Delhi and Varansi from New Delhi Railway Station.
Following is the preliminary draft of English rendering of PM’s statement on terror attack in Pulwama based on the extracts from his speech on this occasion.
“At the outset, my tributes to the soldiers martyred in the terror attack in Pulwama.
I know there is deep anger, your blood boils looking at what has happened.
I am hopeful that the patriotic fervour will ensure that people will provide correct information to our agencies so that we can intensify our efforts to crush terror.
I want to tell the terror outfits and those aiding and abetting them that they have made a big mistake.They will have to pay a very heavy price for their actions.
Let me assure the nation that those behind this attack, the perpetrators of this attack will be punished.
I also understand the sentiments of those who are criticising us.
They have full rights.
However, it is my request to all my friends that it is a very sensitive and emotional moment and the nation stands united in its fight against terror.
Our neighbour which is already isolated by the global community is in a state of illusion, if it thinks that it can demoralize India with its dastardly acts and nefarious designs.
Let me state categorically that it should stop day dreaming to destabilize India.
This neighbour of ours which is in a state of economic despair
Must know that nay such attempt is destined to fail and will be foiled.
Times and again it has been proved that those which follow such routes are destroyed themselves.
The course which we have adopted is one of progress and development.
Many big countries have strongly condemned this terror attack, have stood behind India and expressed support for India.
Friends, after Pulwama terror attack, we are in a state of grief as well as deep anger.
The martyrs live for two dreams- for Suraksha – safety of the nation and for sammridhi- prosperity of the nation.
I salute our martyrs, seek their blessings and assure you that we will leave no stone unturned to fulfil their dreams for which they have laid down their lives for the nation.
We will strive hard to gather momentum on the road to development as a mark of our respect to the martyrs.

I agreed with President Widodo to encourage Indian companies to work closely with Indonesia in the fields of pharmaceuticals, IT & software, and skill development.
As two developing countries we also decided to move on infrastructure development two-way investment flows leveraging our respective capabilities.
In this regard, the CEOs’ Forum should take the lead in identifying new avenues of wider and deeper industry to industry engagement.
We also agreed that early implementation of India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement in Services & Investment, and finalization of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership would be important steps in this regard.
We also underscored the importance of deepening our two decades old valuable cooperation in the field of Space.

Among the views expressed at the roundtable, was a clear assertion that India has the makings of becoming the “clean energy world capital.”
The participants said that clean and renewable energy will soon be an inexpensive energy option, with electricity storage becoming cheaper.
Participants were of the view that States and Cities in India should be allowed to take the lead in clean energy initiatives.
A related thought was that the current grid is not designed for carrying the 175 GigaWatts (GW) of renewable energy that India is targeting, and therefore a complimentary effort is required on the grid side.
Private investment was emphasized as vital for realizing the vision of 175 GW, with a parallel example being given of how Israel had solved its water shortage using private investment.
Experts were of the view that India has to address issues in four key areas – viz. technology integration; finance; regulatory frameworks; and the right talent pool.
They also expressed concern at the financial status of power distribution companies (Discoms) in India.
The CEOs present gave a brief overview of the technologies and innovations being used in their companies.

He said the Government is working to address issues in regulation, and address the financial health of Discoms.
He said that early next month, a district court in the tribal belt of Jharkhand will become entirely solar-powered.
The Prime Minister also mentioned coal gasification as an important area of research.
He expressed confidence of a renewable energy revolution over the next decade.

Your Excellency Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
Your Majesty,
I am delighted to welcome you all to the ASEAN India Commemorative Summit.
Though we are celebrating 25 years of our partnership, our shared voyage goes back thousands of years.
It is a privilege for India to host all the ASEAN Leaders for the second time in five years.
Tomorrow, you will be our honoured Guests at our Republic Day celebrations.
The presence of my brothers and sisters from all our ASEAN partners at this joyous celebration is unprecedented.
Your collective presence here has also touched the hearts of my 1.25 billion fellow Indians.
It highlights the importance of our Strategic Partnership, placing ASEAN at the centre of India’s Act East Policy.
Our friendship has been nurtured by our shared cultural and civilizational linkages.
The Ramayana, the ancient Indian epic, continues to be a valuable shared legacy in ASEAN and the Indian subcontinent.
We have organised a Ramayana Festival with troupes from ASEAN countries, to showcase our common cultural treasure through this great epic.
Other major religions, including Buddhism, also bind us closely.
Islam, in many parts of South East Asia has distinctive Indian connections going back several centuries.
We have also jointly released a set of commemorative stamps, to celebrate our common heritage.
Your Majesty, Excellencies,
This objective, in my view, is best served through free and friendly discussion among us.
Since 1992, our partnership has evolved from sectoral dialogue to strategic partnership.
Today, we have thirty sectoral dialogue mechanisms and seven ministerial level interactions, in addition to annual Summit meetings.
We have made excellent progress in implementing the objectives of the ASEAN-India Partnership for Peace, Progress and Shared Prosperity, through five year plans of action.
The progress in implementing our third Action Plan for the period 2016-2020 is commendable.
Capacity building projects have been undertaken through the ASEAN-India Cooperation Fund, the ASEAN-India Green Fund, and ASEAN-India Science and Technology Fund.
India shares ASEAN’s vision of peace and prosperity through a rules-based order for the oceans and seas.
Respect for international law, notably UNCLOS is critical for this.
We remain committed to work with ASEAN to enhance practical cooperation and collaboration in our shared maritime domain.
Humanitarian and Disaster Relief efforts, Security cooperation, and Freedom of Navigation will be key focus areas for our Maritime cooperation.
The Connectivity Summit was also an affirmation of the linkages that India shares with ASEAN through land, air, maritime, cultural, civilizational and people-to-people relations that date back centuries.
Information and Communications Technology will forge new bonds of digital connectivity among us.
India offers to undertake a pilot project on rural connectivity, which would create digital villages in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam.
Success of this project could be replicated in other ASEAN countries.
In order to deepen our understanding and cooperation in financial matters, I propose a dialogue on digital financial inclusion and investment promotion and infrastructure.
Our 70 billion dollars trade has grown 25 times over 25 years.
Investments from ASEAN and India are robust and growing.
We will continue to work with ASEAN to further enhance our trade ties, and facilitate interactions among our business community.
They are warmly accepted in the local community.
Earlier this month, the ASEAN-India Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Singapore recognised their contribution in forging closer ties between us.
Held at the same time in New Delhi, in the first Conference of Members of Parliament and Mayors with Indian heritage, there was a large representation from ASEAN countries.
To build on our historical bonds, I propose that we declare 2019 as the ASEAN-India Year of Tourism.
We could set up tangible and intangible cultural heritage circuits to further promote tourism.
The Buddhist Tourism circuit could be an important part of this to attract tourists and pilgrims from our region.
India has participated in restoration works to historical structures which attest our enduring civilizational bonds.
It was a privilege for India to play a role in conservation works of temples in Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao PDR and Vietnam.
A virtual knowledge portal of ASEAN India network of Museums could curate this shared heritage.
An important focus of our commemorative events celebrates the power of our youth, our future.
We would also like to offer dedicated training courses at the Indian Academy of Highway Engineers for ASEAN Highway Professionals.
I also propose that we set up a network of Universities to encourage greater inter-university exchanges.
In conclusion, let me again join my people in expressing our profound appreciation to each one of you for kindly accepting my invitation and for joining us at this Commemorative Summit.
यदिदी ह्येकार (my good friend) Prime Minister Netanyahu
Friends from the Media, I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mrs. Sara Netanyahu for opening their home to me today.
I am most grateful for their warm and generous hospitality.
Just a short while back, I laid a wreath at the Yad Vashem Memorial museum to remember and honour over six million Jewish lives that were lost in the horror of the holocaust.
Yad Vashem is a reminder of the unspeakable evil inflicted generations ago.
It is also a tribute to your unbreakable spirit to rise above the depths of tragedy, overcome hatred and forge ahead to build a vibrant democratic nation.
Yad Vashem tells us that those who believe in humanity and civilized values must come together and defend it at all costs.
As such, we must resolutely oppose the evils of terrorism, radicalism and violence that plague our time.
The link between our people goes back to thousands of years when the first Jews landed on India’s south-western coastline.
Since then, the Jews have flourished, and their traditions and practices thrived in India.
My visit to Israel celebrates this ancient bond between communities across both our nations.
And, I am happy that I will have occasion to engage with the rich Indian diaspora in Israel later tomorrow.
In modern times, our ties have seen rapid growth since the establishment of our full diplomatic relations a quarter century ago.
Common objectives of economic prosperity, strong technology and innovation ties and the need to secure our societies define the space for convergent action between us.
Over coming decades, we want to frame a relationship that transforms the landscape of our economic engagement.
India is the world’s fastest growing large economy.
Our focus on using technology and innovation to meet our development priorities provides productive scope to expand our academic, scientific & research, and business links.
We also want to put in place a robust security partnership to respond to shared threats to our peace, stability and prosperity.
Welcoming the delegates to the International Conference and Cultural Festival from India and abroad, the Prime Minister paid his respects to Dada Lekhraj, the founder of Prajapita Brahmakumari Ishvariya Vishvidyalaya.

I am very happy to be here for the North Eastern Council Plenary meeting.
I also take this opportunity of welcoming you all to this meeting.
I hope that the deliberations that have already taken place since yesterday and further deliberations that we have today, will help in faster development of this region.
I am also happy to note that the North Eastern Council has provided support in the development of the North East region.
It has been instrumental in establishment of a number of institutions and taking up infrastructure projects in the region.
The North Eastern Council was set up in 1972.
Since then it has contributed to the development of the North East region.
To meet the growing aspirations of the people, it is important that the North Eastern Council introspects and assesses the extent to which it has been able to achieve its objectives.
Perhaps, there is a need to re-orient and upgrade the North Eastern Council.
You may like to consider developing the North Eastern Council as a state-of-the-art resource centre for the North Eastern states with the necessary resources, knowledge and skills.
The resource centre may enable the states and the implementing agencies to properly plan and execute projects, promote research and innovations and provide strategic policy vision for the region.
The North Eastern Council may look into developing a specialised domain expertise either by itself or through an agency model to assist states and central ministries in their development planning as also problem solving needs.
This will enable the imbibing of good governance and best practices in the region.
The North Eastern Council should also consider focussing on issues in emerging areas of livelihood, entrepreneurship, venture funds, start-ups and skill development.
All this will help in generating jobs.
The government has been focussing on the development of the North East region through its pro-active “Act East Policy”.
As part of this policy, we are focussing on reducing the isolation of the region by improving all round connectivity through road, rail, telecom, power and waterways sectors.
I am also convinced that India can move forward if all the regions develop including the North East region.
The North East region is also very important to us for strategic reasons.
And it is my conviction that we have to bring this region at par with the other developed regions of the country.
In the current Budget, more than Rs.30,000 crores have been earmarked for the North East region.
It should be our endeavour to ensure that this money is spent well for the development of the region.
We believe in cooperative and competitive federalism.
States that are strong and want to grow further, need to be given adequate authority and resources.
And States that are not so strong, need to be given needful assistance.
It is in this regard that based on the report of the Committee of Chief Ministers, we have decided to continue to provide assistance in the ratio of 90:10 for core Central schemes and 80:20 for non-core schemes to the North Eastern States.
In the recent past, we have established two important projects in Assam – Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited and Numaligarh Refinery Limited’s wax unit.
These are big projects that would create huge employment opportunities in the North East region.
However, it has taken us many years to complete these projects.
We have to ensure that we are able to complete our projects in time and without cost over-runs.
Only then can we realise the true benefits of these projects.
The North East is the gateway to South East Asia and we need to take advantage of this.
We are opening up both road and rail routes to our neighbouring countries.
This should give a boost to the economic development of the region.
We have created a specialised highways construction agency for the North East – the “National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation” – that was incorporated on 18th July 2014.
Since then it has set up its Branch Offices, one each in every North Eastern State.
As of today, it is implementing 34 projects in the North Eastern States covering a length of 1001 kilometres at a total cost of over Rs. 10,000 crore.
In the road sector, we need to keep in view the special land and weather conditions of this area.
Most of the North East areas get a lot of rainfall and are also prone to natural calamities and land-slides.
We thus need to be careful in using appropriate technologies in the construction of roads in this area.
We have recently implemented an improved internet connectivity project for the North East region in collaboration with Bangladesh.
This will make available 10 GB of seamless alternate bandwidth for the region.
This integration will benefit the North East region tremendously.
The Government is also making a heavy investment in power transmission projects covering all the eight North Eastern states at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore.
This would ensure power to more areas.
The recent commissioning of Bishwanath-Chariyali-Agra transmission line has also brought 500 MegaWatt additional capacity to the region.
Agartala in Tripura has also been connected with broad gauge line.
We are on the way to ensure that all the North East states come on the rail map soon.
In the North East, the Indian Railways has commissioned about 900 kilometres of Broad Gauge in the last two years, leaving only about 50 kilometres Meter Gauge lines to be converted in 2016-17.
In addition, a 132 kilometre part of third alternative connectivity route to North East (that is New Maynaguri – Jogighopa) has also been commissioned.
All the states of the North East region are blessed with natural scenic beauty, distinct historical cultural and ethnic heritage.
All this offers tremendous scope for tourism in the region.
There is also a great scope for mountaineering, trekking and adventure tourism in the region.
If developed and promoted well, this can emerge as the biggest employer in the region.
It can also add to the growth and income of the region.
I understand that the Ministry of Tourism has identified a thematic circuit for the North East region.
I hope that the North Eastern states will make the best use of the scheme to develop tourist circuits and attract tourists from all over the world.
The region can also look into combining a few popular destinations of the neighbouring countries with their tourism circuits.
This will be an added attraction for tourists.
The majority of youth of the North East region is English speaking.
The North East States must avail facilities and get these BPOs operationalized in their respective States.
This will promote growth and provide jobs to our youth.
The North East is home to exotic fruits, flowers, vegetables, aromatic plants, and herbs.
Most of them are organic in origin.
If we focus our development strategy on organic farming, it would help the region greatly.
A few months ago, I was in Sikkim and participated in a function to declare Sikkim as the first organic state in the country.
There is a large rural population in the North East region.
If we talk of Assam alone, 86% of the population lives in rural areas.
We have initiated the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Mission to bring in economic, social and basic development of the rural areas in a cluster model.
It should be the endeavour of the region’s states to make use of this mission for the development of the rural areas.
In the end, I would like to express my gratitude to the chairman and all the members of the North Eastern Council for successfully conducting the plenary meeting in Shillong.
My special thanks to the Governor and the Chief Minister of Meghalaya for hosting this meeting.
I am sure that the deliberations in this meeting will go a long way in providing direction to the development of the region.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi was apprised of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between India and United Kingdom on technical cooperation in the field of Sustainable Urban Development in April, 2018.

80,000 crore rupees are being spent to complete pending irrigation projects.
He said several Model Acts related to farmers’ welfare have been prepared, and States have been urged to implement them.
The Prime Minister said that the Government is working to ensure that farmers get modern seeds, adequate power supply, and easy market access.
He said that for this purpose the cost will include elements such as labour, rent for machinery, cost of seeds and fertilizers, revenue being given to State Government, interest on working capital, and rent of leased land.
The Prime Minister said comprehensive steps are being taken for Agriculture Marketing Reforms.
It is important to connect Rural Retail Markets with wholesale and global markets.
He said that in the recent Union Budget, Grameen Retail Agriculture Markets have been envisaged.
He said Farmer Producer Organizations, would be given relief on income tax, on the lines of cooperative societies.
He said a new chapter in Agriculture Marketing Reform is being added in this programme, with the e-marketing portal for organic products.
He said that along with the Green Revolution and White Revolution, we must stress on Organic Revolution, Water Revolution, Blue Revolution, and Sweet Revolution.
The Prime Minister explained how honey-bees could be an important source of additional income for farmers.

On this day, a youngster aged 18 years, Khudiram Bose, was sent to the gallows.
It tells us about the struggle for independence and the sacrifices and reminds us of our responsibility towards the nation.
Respectable Shri Venkaiah Naidu has become the first Vice President of the country, who was born in independent India.
I think maybe he is the only Vice President who has been associated with this environment for so many years and knows the nuances of the House.
The Country has got a Vice President who is familiar with everybody and everything – from the members to the committees, to the proceedings of the House.
And today we all have elected him and handed him over the responsibility for this position.
Venkaiah ji is the son of a farmer.
I have had the privilege of working with him for many years.
Be it for a village, for the poor, or for the farmers, he had been providing his inputs all the time while studying these topics very closely.
He was the Urban Development Minister in the Cabinet too.
But I always felt that during the discussions in the cabinet he used to talk more about farmers and the problems of rural areas than the subjects related to urban areas.
This topic was close to his heart probably because of his family background and childhood which was associated with villages.
As Venkaiah ji has taken over the office of the Vice President, it is our responsibility to familiarize the whole world with it.
There are also responsibilities which should be viewed in isolation from the politics.
India’s democracy is very mature.
Indian constitution is very powerful.
The significance of the constitution that our great men had bequeathed to us is such that the people who have the constitutional posts in India today are those who were born in rural areas or had poverty stricken family background; they have not come from any rich family.
Thus, I can clearly see the inheritance that our forefathers have given us.
Once again I would like to bow down those constitution makers.
Venkaiah ji is a great personality with austerity and great oratory skills.
And sometimes when he makes speeches in Telugu, it seems that he is running super-fast.
But for that there should be clarity in thought and the ability to connect with the audience.
It is not about playing with words; those who are associated with the world of oratory are well aware that just playing with words can never touch anybody’s heart.
But when one expresses his ideas with conviction which are based on a vision and beliefs, then the person touches the heart of the people.
And Venkaiah ji has always been successful in this regard.
One such demand is for the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana in their respective areas.
It is a matter of pride for all the MPs that the idea of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana was envisaged by our very Vice-President, the Venerable Venkaiah Ji.
This can only happen when one can empathise with the poor, the farmer, and the oppressed and is determined to take them out of their problems.
Heartiest congratulations and thanks a lot!

The Hon’ble Speaker mam, my gratitude to you and all the respected members of the House on this occasion.
However even after years, such major events the memory of such major events are source of inspiration for the people.
Remembering such important events gives a new boost to the life and strength to the nation.
In the same way it is our duty to ensure that this message reaches out to our new generations.
Every generation is responsible for bequeathing the legacy and the glorious history of their times generations, the atmospherics at that time, the sacrifices of our great men, the duty, the power, to the future generations.
When the August Kranti was commemorated in its 25th year and 50th year, it was celebrated by the people across the country.
As we commemorate the 75th year of this event today, it indeed a matter of pride for us.
There for I am grateful to the speaker mam for having provided this opportunity.
Such movement in the history of our nation should be seen as a new inspiration, new energy, new resolve and the spirit of innovation among the people.
India became a free country in 1947.
However, the movement in 1942 was in a way the final mass struggle that the fellow citizens were waiting for.
The 1942 movement prepared the ground work for our independence.
It was followed by Mahatma Gandhi Dandi march in 1930.
If it’s not for today, it will never happen again; such was the mood of the people of the country.
Thus, every person of this country was involved in this movement.
It seemed that Rajaji’s movement was being carried out through the elite class.
However in 1942, the movement had spread to every region and every social class in the country.
The guiding forces were the words of Gandhi ji.
This was the movements where the slogan of ‘Quit India’ was on everyone’s lips.
One of the most striking features of this movement was that the sentiments which appeared in the minds of the people were altogether different from Gandhi ji’s thoughts, contemplation and ethics.
The key words of this great man were, ‘We shall do or die’.
These words from Gandhi ji were unique for the nation.
Gandhi had said, “From today onwards, everyone should consider himself as an independent woman or a man and should act accordingly.
I’m not going to be content with anything less than complete independence.
We will do or die”.
However the situation and the pressure was such that even Bapu, had to adapt to the people’s emotions while assuming the leadership.
All sections of the society; the villages, the farmers, the labourers, the teachers, the students joined this movement with the slogan ‘Do or die’.
The country was desperate for that freedom, be it a leader or an ordinary Indian, there was no difference in the intensity of this feeling.
I believe that when the country stands united and when there is a power of unity, when the goal is set, the target is set then the people can walk towards that direction.
Within five-years i.e. between 1942 and 1947 Mother India became free.
The country put itself inside the oven of revolution.
The flame of revolution was engulfing the country.
Bombay showed the way.
All means of transport were stopped.
The Court proceedings were stalled.
The news of the bravery of the people of India and the brutality of British government was reaching every corner.
The public had well placed the Gandhian mantra of ‘Do or Die’.
This book provides the description of that time and shows the kind of atmosphere at that time.
It is true that British colonialism began in India and also ended in India.
It was not only the freedom of India; after 1942 the way this flame erupted against the colonial rule across the world, India’s freedom became a source of inspiration for colonies in Africa and Asia.
The way this inspiration had spread to various parts of the world had become a cause of tribute to the masses of India.
This tells us that this was a good evidence of the determination of India.
The lesson for us is that when we are determined to do something we gradually move towards the desired goal.
The history is the evidence of this fact.
At that time, the poetry of the national poet, Sohan Lal Dwivedi, vividly described the power of Bapu and the time and movement .
In his poem he had said-
But today when we are in 2017 we cannot deny the fact that we do not have a Gandhi today.
If we all try together it will not be a difficult task to fulfil the dreams of Gandhi and dreams of those freedom fighters.
Today we have the opportunity in 2017 an enabling situation like that of 1942.
The world is undergoing a crisis today.
We should place the country above the party.
Politics should be separated from this.
If there are 1.25 crore people in the country, then we can easily progress by bringing the solutions to these problems successfully.
How can anyone deny the fact that corruption can destroy the country like a termite – be it a political corruption, social corruption, or personal corruption.
Let us not get into the controversy on who were involved and when.
Poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy are the challenges in front of us.
For some of the issues we also had different sections of people in 1942.
The people who believed in the violence were different.
This is our path under Gandhi’s leadership.
Our upbringing and ideologies might be different.
But today’s time demands that we take the opportunity to free the country from some issues, whether it is poverty, hunger or illiteracy.
Why is that Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of village Swaraj has been left behind?
What is the reason that the people have left the villages and are staying in the cities?
What was the issue concerning Gandhi ji regarding the village?
Can we revive that dream?
Can we do anything for the poor farmers, dalits, and the deprived class?
This is the time when the inspiration gives us the power to do something for the people and this inspiration should be utilised.
We know that sometimes duties are neglected, authority is misused.
This happens in both the political and social life.
Unfortunately, some of these vices have entered into some of our lives and has turned it into a ‘way of life’.
If I spit somewhere, I do not feel that I am doing something wrong.
Breaking rules has become our way of life.
Even the smallest incidents are taking us towards violence.
Wake up to the duty of the society!
Toilets and cleanliness are not a matter of mockery.
Those mother and sisters have to spend so much time waiting for the darkness to relieve.
Thus, the mind-set of the society needs to be changed.
It is necessary to educate the public to use the toilets.
We have to be alive to this matter and these values can be instilled not by the law.
We have to understand our duty.
We should think of the mothers and sisters of our country who are under this burden.
The country should bear the burden of at least a class of people which includes women and sisters of this country.
Their strengths can give us strength.
Even today, they have as much contribution to the nation.
In order to take them forward, we should move forward with this duty.
Gradually growing, slowly spreading, people were slowly connecting.
But from Nineteen Forty Two to Nineteen Forty Seven, it was not an incremental change.
There was an environment of disruption which forced the British to finish all the equations and give us freedom; to force them to go.
And technology played a greater role.
We can feel a positive change with this disruption.
Just as we saw a quantum jump, I think 2017 and 2022, 75 years of Quit India and 75 years of independence respectively; within these five years, the same mood that existed between 1942 and 1947 shall prevail.
If in the span of 5 years from two thousand Seventeen to Two thousand Twenty Two we take this responsibility to carry India to that height in front of the world then this only is the quest for leadership.
It will be a great service to the nation if the country comes together in this endeavour.
I am confident that we can do a lot of work with consensus on certain issues.
The success of GST is the result of the willpower of the people sitting in this House.
Whether sitting here or anywhere, it goes to all the states; goes to the general merchant of the country; And because of that, it was possible.
And as a representative of the 1.25 Crore people, with the resolution of 2022, I believe that we shall continue to bring those results.
Mahatma Gandhi had given the slogan of ‘do or die’; that was the formula of that time.
We will all get together the poor and give them their rights.
Together we will give young people more opportunities of self-employment.
Together we will end the problem of malnutrition from the country.
We will all end and eliminate the hindrances that stop women from moving ahead.
In these five years, from 2017 to 2022, on 75 th year of independence, we should fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters.
With this expectation, I once again express my gratitude to you Madam and pay my obeisant to the freedom fighters.

• To take initiatives for bringing harmonization and standardization in laws and policies of member countries concerning conservation of fauna and flora;
• To document the trend of poaching and illegal trade, and related threats to the natural biodiversity within and across countries in the region;
The South Asia region is very vulnerable to illegal traffic and wildlife crimes due to presence of precious biodiversity and large markets as well as traffic routes for wildlife products in the south East Asian region.

This MoU will strengthen the bonds of friendship between the two countries and increase the bilateral cooperation on the issues of prevention, rescue, recovery and repatriation related to human trafficking especially women and children expeditiously.
The MoU is expected to be signed during the Home Ministers upcoming visit to Bahrain in the first week of April 2016.
The following are the salient features of the Memorandum of Understanding between India and Kingdom of Bahrain:
i. To strengthen cooperation to prevent to all forms of human-trafficking, especially that of women and children and ensure speedy investigation and prosecution of traffickers and organized crime syndicates in either country.
ii. Taking preventive measures that would eliminate human-trafficking in women and children and in protecting the rights off victims of trafficking.
iii. Anti-trafficking Cells and Task Force will work on both sides to prevent human trafficking.
iv. Police and other concerned authorities will work in close-cooperation and exchange information which can be used to interdict human traffickers,
v. The repatriation of victims would be done as expeditiously as possible and home country will undertake the safe and effective re-integration of the victims,
vi. A Joint Task Force with representatives from both sides would be constituted to monitor the working of the MoU.
As a destination of trafficking, South Asian countries are mainly affected by domestic trafficking, or trafficking from the neighboring countries.
However, South Asian victims are also increasingly detected in the Middle East.
India is a source and transit country as far as trafficking to Bahrain is concerned.
On the other hand, Bahrain is a destination country for men and women subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor and forced prostitution.
Men and women from South Asia migrate voluntarily to Bahrain to work as domestic workers or as unskilled laborers in the construction and service industries.
However, some face conditions of forced labor after arriving in Bahrain, through use of such practices as unlawful withholding of passport, restrictions on movement, contract substitution, non¬payment of wages, threats, and physical or sexual abuse.
The reinforcement of anti-trafficking efforts at all levels between the Kingdom of Bahrain and India is essential for prevention and protection of victims.
This requires mutual cooperation among both the countries for intelligence sharing, joint investigation and a coordinated response to the challenges of human trafficking.
For this purpose, it is proposed to sign an MoU with the Kingdom of Bahrain.
India has already signed one MoU to prevent trafficking with Bangladesh.

The development of the ECC and supporting components is expected to help increase the share of Asia in terms of number of events to around 15% by 2021.
It is estimated that the proposed ECC facility will infuse a demand for more than 100 international and local exhibition events annually.
Development of the ECC and support facilities is estimated to contribute more than one million international delegates based (non-leisure) Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions (MICE) tourism per annum.
The proposed Exhibition Centre, Convention Centre and Multi Performance Arena developments are estimated to generate over five lakh direct and indirect employment opportunities.
The job creation shall not be limited to core ECC facilities but would also entail opportunities for regular formal employment in supporting ECC land uses like retail, office and hospitality.
Background:-
India lacks an integrated world class facility which can meet the requirements of global exhibition-cum-convention operators in terms of space, project facilities, transportation linkages, etc.
Only a few centres in terms of organized space are available in the country.
Further, the huge constant demand for exhibitions and related activities puts immense pressure on the existing facilities resulting in lesser time available for maintenance to hold large sized events and maintain international standards.
It has been estimated that the global MICE market, which supports 400,000 conferences and exhibitions worldwide, is of the size of US $ 280 billion and is a significant economic driver for a large number of nations.
The total size of the Asian MICE market accounts for US$ 60 billion having demonstrated a growth of 38% since 2006.
In the absence of world class exhibition and conference facilities, India has not benefited from the potential benefits of this development.
In order to capitalize on this vast market and to drive India’s industry, commerce, trade and tourism, the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion has taken the initiative to develop a State-of-The-Art Exhibition-cum-Convention Centre at Delhi.

My dear friends, brothers and sisters,
For me, India is not confined to its territory.
India also exists in every Indian in every part of the world.
India is in you.
As I stand before you, I am reminded of the words of the great Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar:
“Friendship is not just a smile on the face.
The saint’s words on friendship capture the feeling that I get each time I come to Malaysia.
It does not matter, whether I came here without office or I come now as a Prime Minister of India.
I have felt the same embrace of friendship and welcome.
The love and friendship of the Malaya-Indians has always had a special place in my heart.
Generations ago, many of your ancestors came to an unknown land.
Many of you came here more recently in the mobility of our globalised world.
Whenever you came here, whatever be the circumstance in which you came, time or distance has not reduced your love for India.
I see this in the light and colour of the festivals.
They are as bright as they have always been.
I see this in the pure strains of music, the grace of the dancer, the bells of devotion and the call to prayer.
And, Malaya-Indians are the largest contingent to the annual Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas in India.
And, Malay Indians make Vibrant Gujarat Summit more vibrant.
India and Malaysia were once under the same colonial power.
We both became free within a decade of each other.
And, Independent India owes a debt of gratitude to Malaya-Indians.
The glory of India’s freedom struggle was written, in part, by the struggles and sacrifices of Malaya-Indians.
Thousands of your forefathers came forward to join Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Women poured out in large numbers from the comfort of their homes to march shoulder to shoulder with Netaji Subhash Bose.
Today I pay special tribute to Puan Sri Capt. Janaky Athi Nahappan, who served as deputy to Capt. Lakshmi Sehgal.
That was in the regiment named after yet another icon of India’s war of Independence, Rani of Jhansi.
On behalf of every Indian, I also honour all the unnamed and unknown Malaya-Indians, who laid down their lives so that a free India could rise.
To their children and grand-children, I say a big thank you.
And, here in Kuala Lumpur, we will name our Indian Cultural Centre after Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.
70 years ago a tragic and deadly World War came to an end.
I also pay homage to the countless Indian soldiers who lost their lives in the battle fields of Malaysia.
A majority of those who laid down their lives were Sikhs.
Their blood is permanently mixed with the soil of Malaysia.
It was a war that mattered for both our countries.
And, their blood in the Malaysian soil now forms a bond between our two countries that can never be erased.
And, the valour and duty they stood for is alive in the spirit of the Punjab Regiment, the Sikh Regiment, the Jat Regiment and the Dogra Regiment in India.
We are prepared to work with the Government of Malaysia to build a War Memorial to our fallen soldiers at the site of Battle of Kampar in Perak.
While Malaya-Indians were responding with courage and passion to the call of Netaji, they were also inspired by the life and mission of Mahatma Gandhi.
To the Indian community in Sungai Petani, I salute you for the Gandhi Memorial Hall that you built within a few years of his martyrdom.
You had not met him.
Gandhiji did not manage to visit Malaysia.
But, he touched your hearts.
And, as a community you came together to build that memorial on your own: To honour his memory: in respect for his principles; in a tribute to what he had done for Mother India and mankind.
There are few things that can be as moving as this: a homage in silence, expressed in action, and built into a living memorial.
And it is my proud privilege to announce that we will install a Bust of Gandhiji at the Gandhi Memorial Hall.
Your spirit of service remains strong.
And, in 2001, when the earthquake hit my state of Gujarat, Malay Indians came together on their own to raise funds to help victims reclaim life.
From your moving contribution to the freedom struggle to the thriving richness of your culture, India lives in your heart.
You always have a special place in our thoughts.
My dear brothers and sisters,
The spirit of India speaks in your deeds.
You reflect India’s diversity of languages, religions and cultures.
And, you stand together in a spirit of harmony.
Not just with other Malay Indians, but also with all Malay people.
Your achievements have done us proud.
You have toiled with your hands.
With pride and dignity, you made your life here.
You prosper in trade and you make the plantation produce more.
You have contributed to build Malaysia into a vibrant modern nation and an economic power house.
And, you are helping relations between India and Malaysia become stronger and stronger.
I see this in the work of Dr. Subramaniam, Malaysia’s Cabinet Minister for Health.
It is right that a Malay Indian holds this post, since Malay Indians love to become doctors!
And I am pleased that a distinguished Malay Indian, Datu Samy Vellu, is Malaysia’s special Envoy for Cooperation in Infrastructure between India and South Asia.
You are the living bonds of friendship between our two nations.
You reflect a link between India and Malaysia that is ancient as our lands.
From the coast of Coromandal and Kalinga, the ocean carried trade, commerce and culture to the Malaya Peninsula.
If there is trade, Gujarat cannot be far behind.
So, Gujaratis also joined the trade.
In the ruins of the Bujang valley in the State of Kedah, we see the glory of the great Pallava and Chola dynasties in Tamil Nadu.
And the spice route that connected us brought the same flavours to our food.
Our ties are seen in the footprints of the monks, who spread the message of peace from the land of Buddha to the Southeast Asia.
This is the richness of our heritage.
This is the ancient foundation of our modern links.
Today, I had the honour of visiting the Ramakrishna Mission and unveiling the statue of Swami Vivekananda.
This is not only a deeply spiritual moment for me personally.
It also recalls the great journey he undertook more than a century ago, through this region to America.
There he drew upon India’s ancient wisdom to make a passionate call for unity in the world.
He spoke for Asian spirit that is needed today when we dream of an Asian century.
And at a time of great challenges in the world, this statue on the soil of Malaysia is a reminder to the world of the values we so deeply need to repair the fault-lines that are tearing our societies apart.
And, tomorrow Prime Minister Najib and I will jointly inaugurate the Torana Gate at Little India in Brickfields.
That was built more than two thousand years ago.
It is one of the most venerated Buddhist sites in the world.
So, any visitor coming to Little India will be reminded of the message of peace between people; harmony between man and nature; and the relationship between the people of our two great countries.
Above all, the statue and the gate will be a tribute to Malaysia’s diversity and harmony.
Malaysia’s achievements are enormous.
Just six decades after Malaysia gained independence, this nation of 30 million people has much to be proud of.
It has nearly eliminated poverty.
It has placed basic needs within the reach of its entire population.
It has achieved nearly 100 percent literacy.
And, it is providing jobs to everyone who needs it or wants it.
Its tourism sector is flourishing.
And, it has preserved its beautiful gifts of Nature.
Its infrastructure is world class.
It ranks very high on the “ease of doing business”.
And, for five decades, it has averaged a growth rate of over 6 per cent per year.
And this is a truly extraordinary achievement for any country.
India, the land of your heritage, has remarkable achievements since Independence.
This was a nation made weaker by colonialism; torn by Partition at its birth as Independent country.
It is a land of unparalleled diversity and vast social and political challenges.
There were questions whether the infant nation will even reach its teen years.
There are many countries, where the high hopes of democracy at birth have faded along the way.
India is a proud democratic nation, of 1.25 billion people, who have a chance to exercise their franchise.
It is a young country, with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years.
It is nation, where every citizen belongs; where everyone has equal rights that the constitution guarantees, the courts protect and the government defends.
We have many achievements to our credit.
We are a leading producer of food grain, fruits, vegetables and milk.
Our scientists are harnessing the power of Space to improve the quality of life of our people.
We have mastered the boundless power of the atom for energy and medicine.
We are developing vaccines and drugs that puts healthcare within the reach of the poorest.
We produce the best information technology specialists in the world.
We produce doctors and engineers who serve the world.
And, we are making products that are finding their way into the global market.
Our external relations advances peace in the world.
The Indian Armed Forces contribute to region’s security and stability.
They assist all in humanitarian disasters, without asking their nationality.
And, our forces participate in peacekeeping missions around the world.
We have generations of our leaders to thank for bringing us this far.
But, we know that we have a long way to go.
The challenges we face and the goals we must pursue, are evident in villages and cities.
And, my government has come into office to change that:
We are eradicating poverty, by giving our people the fruits of modern economy, such as universal access to banks and insurance; not just tie them down in endless programmes.
We are facilitating business.
And, we are creating a national digital infrastructure that allows ideas, information, communication, business and innovation to flow freely on the cyber space.
We are making our railways the engine of a new economic revolution in the country.
And, we are turning our ports and airports into gateways to prosperity.
And, all this is not easy.
After all, we are talking of 1.25 billion people, more than 500 major cities and six hundred thousand villages.
But, we have faith in the talent and enterprise of Indians.
We have confidence in the strength of the joined hands of our people.
And, they are gathering speed now.
And, it is showing in numbers.
India is today the fastest growing major economy in the world.
I know you feel proud about it.
Every major global institution has placed its bets on India growing strongly.
This is at a time when the rest of the world, including parts of this region, is experiencing a slowdown.
There is change in the cities.
There is momentum in the villages.
And, there is confidence in our citizens, especially our youth.
And, there is change in the way government is working.
We are making government transparent and accountable.
We are eliminating corruption at all levels.
We are making governance driven by policies and systems, not by discretion of individuals.
What happens in a far off country can affect the livelihood of workers in another place.
The decision that may be taken in a conference roomin the UN or WTO can affect the life of a farmer in a village in India.
The lifestyle in one part of the world affects climate and agriculture in another part of the world.
We need each other’s markets and resources.
So, our national progress will depend on the strength and success of our international partnerships.
India has excellent relations with all Southeast Asian countries.
We have a strong partnership with ASEAN.
I have just completed the India-ASEAN Summit.
This is the region, where our economic relations are growing rapidly.
And, it attracts the maximum number of Indian tourists.
I am happy to say that Malaysia is one of our strongest partners and among our closest friends in the region.
Malaysian companies are excellent in infrastructure.
Their largest presence outside Malaysia is in India.
Malaysian investors are present in the world’s second largest telecom market – that is India.
Indian company, IRCON, is helping improve the rail infrastructure in Malaysia.
There are over 150 Indian companies in Malaysia.
There are over 50 Indian IT companies here.
One of our best partnerships in traditional medicine, such as Ayurveda and Unani, is with Malaysia.
We also work closely to keep our citizens safe.
We have strong defence relations.
Indian Air Force helped train their partners in Malaysian Air Force for two years.
We exercise together in air and on land and sea Jal thal aur nabh.
Our security agencies work together against terrorism.
I want to thank Malaysian Government for our strong security cooperation.
Terrorism is the biggest threat to the world today.
It knows no boundary.
It uses the name of religion to draw people to its cause.
But, it is false.
And, it kills people of all faith.
We have to delink religion from terror.
The only distinction is between those who believe in humanity and those who do not.
I have said it before and I will say it here.
The world must come together to combat the biggest challenge of our times.
We can strengthen intelligence cooperation.
We can use military force.
We can make the international legal system for cooperation stronger.
But, when I say that the world must come together, it is not just about more security cooperation.
It also means ensuring that no country uses or promotes terrorism.
There are no sanctuaries.
There are no funds.
There are no arms.
But, we also have to work within our societies and with our youth.
We need the support of parents, communities and religions scholars.
And, we have to make sure that internet does not become a recruiting ground..
We have to promote peaceful relations, mutual understanding and cooperation in our region.
Peace is the only foundation for a prosperous future.
We have many common interests and challenges.
So, all nations in the region, big and small, should work together to ensure that our nations remain safe, our seas secure and free for commerce, and our economies prosperous.
I will meet His Excellency, Prime Minister Najib tomorrow to take our relationship forward.
India and Malaysia have much to benefit from a closer relationship.
Whatever we choose to do, you will be a part of it.
You will breathe more life and strength into relations between India and Malaysia.
We will always seek your partnership in India’s march to progress and in taking this special relationship forward.
But, what we value even more, is the love and affection that binds us together.
For, this is priceless and beyond any measure of value.
You have remained connected with us despite the difficulties of distances and regulations.
You are the window to our heritage and the mirror to our progress.
You are the bridge between India and your country.
You support families and communities in India.
Many of you help a child find her way to a school and a mother access to healthcare.
You do this without seeking an award or getting a headline.
So we must do what we can for you.
We have merged the OCI and PIO cards and we have made the visas life-long.
Besides, Indian origin up to 4th generation is enough to register for OCI now.
This is especially helpful for people like Malay Indians, whose ancestors came here generations ago.
Minor children, who are foreign nationals, and foreign spouses can also get OCI status now.
We have introduced e-visa that has made travel simpler.
Here, in Malaysia, we have opened nine visa collection centres.
There is an eMigrate portal to make it easier and safer for workers to go to certain countries.
It also alerts officials about foreign employers with cases pending against them.
We have an Indian Community Welfare Fund and a fund to help distressed Indian women abroad.
There are times when workers from India get into difficulties here.
Their welfare and security are at the top of our concerns.
Last year, we assisted more than 8000 Indian workers to return home safely.
In Malaysia an India-students Trust Fund was set up in 1954 to give financial assistance to Malaysian-Indian children who lacked the means for education.
This Fund is still needed by a section of the Indian community in Malaysia.
We are happy to announce grant of about 1 million US dollars in additional funds to the corpus of the Trust Fund.
Thousands of your children go to India to become doctors.
While doctors are a critical need for our societies, I hope that you will take the opportunity to get education in other areas as well.
Malaysia and India should immediately recognize the degrees conferred by both our countries.
This is something I intend to take up with Prime Minister Najib.
In conclusion, let me say how proud we are of what you stand for, how you live in this society and what you have achieved.
And each succeeding generation has been defined more by their successes than by their challenges.
So I ask you to continue to pursue your dreams for yourself, for Malaysia and for our two great nations.
I want to leave with you the words of a great son of India, a great symbol of humanity, who also came from the shores of Tamil Nadu.
The late former President APJ Abdul Kalam, one of the makers of modern India, came here in 2008.
So in your success, remember that you will have the joy and pride, not just of fellow Malaysians, but also of the 1.25 billion Indians.
God bless you.
It is a great pleasure and privilege to welcome President Maithripala Sirisena and Mrs. Sirisena to India.
We are honoured that you have chosen India as your first overseas destination.

India is Sri Lanka’s closest neighbour and friend.

Our Commerce Secretaries will meet soon to review our bilateral commercial relations.

This is the first such agreement Sri Lanka has signed.
It opens new avenues for cooperation, including in areas like agriculture and healthcare.
President and I also agreed to expand our defence and security cooperation.
We welcomed the progress in our maritime security cooperation, including in the trilateral format with Maldives.
The Indian assisted projects for Internally Displaced Persons in Sri Lanka have made excellent progress.

This will continue to cover a broad range of areas, including infrastructure.
In this context, I am also pleased with the MoU on cooperation in agriculture.

It affects livelihood on both sides.
We agreed that there must be a constructive and humanitarian approach to the issue.
We will encourage the fishermen`s associations on both sides to meet again soon.
They should find a solution that can be taken forward by both governments.
Like cricket, culture provides a strong bond between us.
The Programme of Cultural Cooperation signed today will nurture those ties and promote contacts between people.
I am also delighted that Sri Lanka is now part of the Nalanda University Project.
Sri Lankan nationals visit the National Museum in New Delhi in large numbers to pay homage to the Kapilavastu relics.
We have decided to reduce the fees for them.
I thanked the President for his invitation to me to visit Sri Lanka.
I am eagerly looking forward to visiting his beautiful country in March.
I would like to once again welcome President Sirisena to India.
We are at a moment of an unprecedented opportunity to take our bilateral relations to a new level.
His visit today has set us firmly in that direction.
His performance has made every Indian happy”, the Prime Minister said.
Recalling his meeting with President Hollande on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Brisbane last year, Prime Minister Modi said that he is looking forward to his visit to France in April.

All of us harbour a lot of hopes and expectations, but keeping the morale of our sports contingent at RIO high is also the solemn duty of us 1.25 billion countrymen.
Just like 1.25 billion Indians I too as a citizen would like to join you in encouraging them, cheering them up.
Come, over the next few days, let us try to the fullest extent possible to make each one of our sportspersons feel proud, to reward them for their endeavours and exertions; and today, as I speak on the Rio Olympics, I would like to mention the name of a poetry lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay a student of the Punjab Central University, who has sent me a poem.

I have specially asked the gynecologists whether they could offer their services free on the 9th of every month, for the sake of under privileged mothers!
Showing concern towards trees even in the midst of a battle, underlines how much importance was attached to trees.
In the Gita, Bhagwan Shri Krishna says, ‘ashwatth sarvvrikshanam’ which means amongst all trees, I am the Peepal Tree.
It is mentioned in Anushasan Parv in Mahabharata that a tree is like an offspring and becomes means of salvation in after life, Sonal has not only taken it upon herself to fulfill her parents’ wishes but society’s expectations also.
In a way, Sonal’s marriage in an everlasting story of love for nature, I congratulate Sonal and Shriman Mhatre Ji for this innovative effort.
Equality and equal opportunity are the two biggest ‘mantras’ for any society and government.
She has made me aware of an incident: –
“Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am Shilpi Varma speaking from Bengaluru.
What is your opinion about such cheat and fraud emails.”
She has pointed a certain incident, and you must also be aware that we get messages on our mobile phones and emails, proclaiming attractive offers that you have won a jackpot of so many rupees; if you pay a certain amount then you become eligible for the greater amount.
And this is what social security in reality is all about; this is the true meaning of Raksha Bandhan.
The 75th year of Quit India and 70th year of Independence can be source of new inspiration, source of new enthusiasm and an occasion to take a pledge to do something for our nation.
Do send a picture of it on ‘Narendra Modi app.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, delivered an address in the Lok Sabha, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement.
The Prime Minister recalled that even as many senior leaders like Mahatma Gandhi were jailed at the beginning of the Quit India Movement, a new generation of leaders emerged to fill the vacuum and take the movement forward.
The Prime Minister noted that the freedom struggle went through several phases, and recalled various leaders and movements that emerged at various points since 1857.
Quoting Gandhiji, the Prime Minister said that all sections of people joined in, responding to Mahatma Gandhi’s clarion call of “Do or Die.”
He said that from political leaders to the common man, everyone was imbued with this spirit.
Five years was all it took to achieve the objective of independence, once the entire country shared this common resolve, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister noted that corruption, poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition are challenges that India now needs to overcome.
He said that a positive transformation, and a common resolve is required for this.
He also mentioned the role played by women in the freedom struggle, and said that women can add immense strength to our common objectives, even today.
The Prime Minister said that if in 1942, the clarion call was “Karenge Ya Marenge,” today the call should be “Karenge aur Karke Rahenge.”
The Prime Minister concluded with the following resolve to overcome corruption, give the poor their rights, give youth self-employment, end malnutrition, end barriers to women empowerment, and end illiteracy:
It’s a matter of pride for all Indians that today as the rising sun will progress on its journey, as the sunrays will reach the earth and light is spread, in all those places people will welcome the sun with Yoga.
When divisive powers gain prominence then it leads to disintegration.
It leads to division among the people, division among the societies and division among the countries.
When there is a division in the society then it leads todiscord within the family and the person breaks down from inside and tension in life continuesto grow.
Societies become the links for national integration.
And this kind of countries bring about peace and harmony in the world.
And humanity flourishes and gainstrength from this feeling of brotherhood.
It means Yoga unites individuals, families, societies, countries and the world and it unites the entire humanity.
When the proposal for Yoga Day was moved in the United Nations then it is a record in the United Nations that this was the first such motion that was co-sponsored by the maximum number of countries in the world.
And this was the first such proposal in the history of United Nations which was approved in the least time.
And today every citizen of the world, every country of the world considers Yoga as its own and it is an important message for the people of India that we are the inheritors of that great legacy, that we have preserved the legacy of that great tradition.
If we start taking pride in our legacy and if we abandon those things which are out of sync with the time, and that kind of thing doesn’t last either.
However, what is appropriate as per the time and which is useful in making of the future, if we take pride in our great legacy of this kind then the world too will never hesitate in taking pride in that.
When parents, when family, when brothers and sisters, all of them accept a child as it is only then the neighbours also start accepting the child.
Today, Yoga has proved this thing that as India has once again attached itself to the power of Yoga, similarly, the world too has started attaching itself with the Yoga.
Today, Yoga has become one of the most powerful unifying forces in the world.
I can say it with full sense of confidence that today if we gather the number of people doing Yoga in the entire world then incredible facts will be revealed to the world.
People gathering for Yoga, people like you gathering for Yoga in different countries, in parks, in open grounds, on the sides of the roads, in offices and homes, in hospitals, in schools and colleges, in the historic buildings, have been providing further energy to the feeling of this universal brotherhood and global friendship.
Friends, the world has embraced Yoga and glimpses of this can be seen in the manner in which International Day of Yoga has been marked every year.
Infact, Yoga Day has become one of the biggest mass movements in the quest for good health and well-being.
Friends, from Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, Yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions.
Yoga is beautiful because it is ancient yet modern…it is constant yet evolving.
It has the best of our past and presents and a ray of hope for our future.
In Yoga, we have the perfect solution to the problems we face, either as individuals or in our society.
Ours is a world that never sleeps.
At every given point, there is something happening in a different part of the world.
A fast-paced existence brings with it lot of stress.
I was shocked to read that every year, almost 18 million people all over the world die due to heart-related diseases.
About 1.6 million people lose the fight against diabetes.
The way to lead a calm, creative and content life is Yoga.
It can show the way in defeating tensions and mindless anxiety.
Instead of dividing, Yoga always unites.
Instead of increasing suffering, Yoga heals.
Practicing Yoga has the ability to herald an era of peace, happiness and brotherhood.
More people practicing Yoga means the world needs more people to teach it.
Over the last three years many individuals are teaching Yoga, new institutions are being set up and even technology is connecting people to Yoga.
I urge you all to build on this momentum in the times to come.
May this Yoga Day become an opportunity to deepen our connect with Yoga and motivate people around us to practice it.
This can be the enduring impact of this day.
It has revealed in the studies conducted by Coventry University and Radboud University that Yoga not only provides relief to our bodies but it can also reverse those molecular reactions taking place in our DNA that cause illness and depression.
It is essential for us to stay healthy to join in the every activity, every process of the nation building and Yoga certainly has a big role in this thing too.
Therefore, today, I urge you people that those who have been practicing Yoga please make it regular, and those who could not start doing Yoga so far they must make an effort once.
Friends, the increasing spread of Yoga has brought the world to India and India to the world even closer.
The position that Yoga has got in the world due to constant efforts made by us that position will be further strengthened with the time.
Please come forward, let us further intensify our efforts by keeping our responsibility in the mind.
From this holy land, I once again convey my best wishes to the Yoga enthusiast all over the world.
I convey my sincere regards to the government of Uttarakhand for organising this event.

Governor of Andhra Pradesh, Shri E. S. L. Narasimhan
Vice Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara University, Professor A. Damodaram
I am delighted to begin the New Year with distinguished scientists from home and abroad in the holy city of Tirupati.
I am happy to inaugurate this 104th session of The Indian Science Congress in the panoramic campus of Sri Venkateswara University.
And I appreciate the Indian Science Congress Association for choosing an appropriate theme “Science & Technology for National Development” for this year’s session.
The nation will always be grateful to the scientists who have worked tirelessly to empower our society by their vision, labour, and leadership.
The speed and scale of changes we encounter today are unprecedented.
How are we going to respond to these challenges that we do not even know could arise?
It is a deep-rooted curiosity-driven scientific tradition which allows quick adaptation to new realities.
Tomorrow’s experts will come from investments we make today in our people and infrastructure.
My government is committed to supporting different streams of scientific knowledge; ranging from fundamental science to applied science with emphasis on innovations.
In the last two sessions of the science congress, I presented before you several key challenges and opportunities for the nation.
Some of these important challenges are in the key sectors of clean water & energy, food, environment, climate, security, and healthcare.
We equally need to keep an eye on the rise of disruptive technologies and be prepared to leverage them for growth.
We need to clearly assess the challenges and opportunities for our technology readiness and competitiveness.
I have been told that the Technology Vision 2035 document released in last year’s Science Congress, is now developing into a detailed roadmap for twelve key technology sectors.
Further, NITI Aayog is evolving a holistic science and technology vision for the country.
One important area that needs to be addressed is the rapid global rise of Cyber-Physical Systems.
This has the potential to pose unprecedented challenges and stresses to our demographic dividend.
But we can turn it into a huge opportunity by research, training and skilling in robotics, artificial intelligence, digital manufacturing, big data analysis, deep learning, quantum communication and Internet-of-Things.
There is a need to develop and exploit these technologies in services and manufacturing sectors; in agriculture, water, energy & traffic management; health, environment, infrastructure and Geo Information Systems; security; financial systems and in combating crime.
We need to develop an Inter-Ministerial National Mission in the Cyber-Physical Systems to secure our future by creation of basic R&D infrastructure, manpower and skills.
The oceans that surround the Indian peninsula have over thirteen hundred of our islands.
They also give us a seven and a half thousand kilometre coastline and 2.4 million square kilometres of Exclusive Economic Zone.
They contain enormous opportunities in energy, food, medicine and a host of other natural resources.
The ocean economy should be a significant dimension of our sustainable future.
I am told, that the Ministry of Earth Sciences is working to launch a Deep Ocean Mission to explore, understand and harness this resource in a responsible way.
This could be a transformative step for the prosperity and security of the nation.
Our best science and technology institutions should further strengthen their basic research in line with leading global standards.
Translating this basic knowledge into innovations, start-ups and industry will help us achieve inclusive and sustainable growth.
I am sure that our scientists will further meet the challenges of enhanced quality of basic research, its technology translation and its societal connect.
By 2030 India will be among the top three countries in science and technology and will be among the most attractive destinations for the best talent in the world.
The wheels we set in motion today will achieve this goal.
Science must meet the rising aspirations of our people.
India fully appreciates the strong role science and technology plays in meeting the societal needs.
We must address the problems of urban-rural divide and work for inclusive development, economic growth and employment generation.
To enable this, there is a need for a new overarching structure that will coordinate with all the relevant stakeholders.
In particular, our infrastructure and socio-economic ministries must make appropriate use of science and technology.
Our Institutions could consider inviting outstanding scientists from abroad including NRIs for long term research associations.
We should involve foreign and NRI PhD students in post-doctoral research in our projects.
Another empowering factor for scientific delivery is the Ease of Doing Science.
If we want science to deliver, we must not constrain it.
Building a strong Science and Technology infrastructure that is accessible to academia, start-ups, industry and R&D labs is a priority of the government.
We need to address the problems of ease of access, maintenance, redundancy and duplication of expensive equipments in our Scientific Institutions.
The desirability of establishing professionally managed, large regional centers in PPP mode housing high value scientific equipment should be examined.
On the lines of Corporate Social Responsibility, the concept of Scientific Social Responsibility needs to be inculcated to connect our leading institutions to all stakeholders, including schools and colleges.
We must create an environment for sharing of ideas and resources.
The brightest and best in every corner of India should have the opportunity to excel in science.
This will ensure that our youth get high-end training exposure to the best of science and technology to make them job-ready in a competitive world.
To this end, I would exhort the National Laboratories to connect with schools and colleges to develop appropriate training programs.
This will also help with the effective use and maintenance of our vast scientific and technological infrastructure.
Laboratories, Research Institutions and Universities in each major city region, should be interlinked to function on a hub and spoke model.
The hubs will share major infrastructure, drive our national science missions and be the engines that link discovery to application.
College teachers with background in research can be connected to the neighbouring universities and R&D institutions.
Outreach activities from the institutions of eminence to schools, colleges and polytechnics will activate the latent Science and Technology manpower from the educational institutions in your neighbourhoods.
Seeding the power of ideas and innovation in schoolchildren will broaden the base of our innovation pyramid and secure the future of our nation.
As a step in this direction, Ministry of Science & Technology is initiating a programme focused on students of classes 6 to 10.
The programme will scout, mentor, reward and showcase ten lakh top innovative ideas focused on local needs from 5 lakh schools.
For a large and diverse country like India, technology needs to span a wide range; from advanced space, nuclear and defence technologies to rural development needs in providing clean water, sanitation, renewable energy, community health, etc.
While we excel globally, we also need to develop local solutions that fit our unique context.
There is a need to develop appropriate Micro-Industry models for the rural areas that use local resources and skills to meet the local needs and generate local enterprise and employment.
For example, we should develop a host of technologies based on efficient co-generation for clusters of villages and semi-urban areas.
These technologies should aim to convert agri and bio-waste to satisfy multiple needs of electricity, clean water, crop-processing and cold storage.
The role of science in planning, decision making, and governance has never been more important.
We need to develop and deploy Geo-information Systems to meet the development goals of our citizens, Gram Panchayats, Districts and States.
A coordinated effort by the Survey of India, ISRO and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology can be transformative.
For sustainable development, we must take strong measures to focus on Waste to Wealth Management in the critical areas of electronic waste, biomedical and plastic wastes, and solid waste and waste water solutions.
We are scaling up R&D on clean carbon technologies, technologies for enhancement of energy efficiency and increased and efficient use of renewable energy.
Focus on environment and climate remains our priority to ensure sustainable development.
Can we redesign our brick kilns for reduced emissions and greater energy efficiency?
Science and technology is a key factor in the Startup India Programme launched in January 2016.
Two other strong initiatives are Atal Innovation Mission and NIDHI – the National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations.
These programmes focus on building an innovation driven enterprise ecosystem.
Further, Public-Private partnerships with CII, FICCI and high technology private companies are being pursued to strengthen the innovation ecosystem.
Our Scientists have contributed strongly to the strategic vision of the nation.
The Indian space programme has put India among the top space faring nations.
We have achieved a high degree of self-sufficiency in space technology, including launch vehicle development, payload and satellite building, applications for development and the building of core competence and capacity.
The Defence Research & Development Organisation has played the role of a force multiplier for the Armed Forces with its systems and technologies.
We are leveraging strategic international partnerships and collaborations based on the principles of mutuality, parity and reciprocity, to make Indian Science globally competitive.
We are also placing special emphasis on building strong relationships with our neighbouring countries and multilateral fora such as BRICS.
The best of global science is helping us unravel creation’s mysteries and develop cutting-edge technologies.
Last year, we activated the 3.6 meter optical telescope in Devasthal in Uttarakhand made with Indo-Belgian collaboration.
Recently, we approved the LIGO project with USA to construct a state-of-the-art detector system in India.
In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the Government remains committed to provide the best support to our Scientists and Scientific Institutions.
I am sure that our scientists will scale up their efforts ranging from the quality of basic sciences to technology development to innovation.
Let Science and Technology become a strong tool of inclusive development and betterment of the weakest and poorest segments of our society.
Together, we will prevail to make a just, equitable and prosperous nation.

Your Excellency President Mahmoud Abbas
Members of the Palestinian and Indian delegations,
Members of the Media, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Sabah-al-kher (Good Morning)
It is a matter of great happiness for an Indian Prime Minister to come to Ramallah for his first ever visit.
President Abbas, I would like to thank you for the words that you said in my honor and also for the very warm and grand welcome extended to me and my delegation.
Excellency, you have very cordially bestowed me with the highest honor of Palestine.
This is a matter of great respect for the entire India and it is also a symbol of Palestine’s friendship and goodwill for India.
The old and strong historical relations between India and Palestine have stood the test of time.
Our incessant and steadfast support to the Palestinian cause has always been on top of our foreign policy.
Therefore I am happy to stand here in Ramallah with President Mahmoud Abbas who is a very old friend of India.
I was privileged to welcome him during his New Delhi visit last May.
I am happy to renew our friendship and India’s support.
During this visit I got the opportunity to pay my tributes at the tomb of Abu Omar.
He was among the top leaders of his time.
His role in Palestinian struggle is unprecedented.
Abu Omar was also a distinguished friend of India.
Visiting the museum dedicated to him has also been an unforgettable experience for me.
Once again I offer my heartfelt tributes to Abu Omar.
Ladies & Gentlemen,
Remarkable courage and perseverance has been displayed by the people of Palestine in the face of constant challenges and crises.
You have demonstrated rock like determination to deal with the circumstances and that too at a time when there was an atmosphere of instability and insecurity which hampers progress and which puts in jeopardy the benefits which have been acquired after significant struggle.
The difficulties and challenges against which you have moved ahead is really commendable.
We appreciate your spirit and your faith in your efforts for a better tomorrow.
India is a very old ally in Palestine’s nation-building efforts.
We have cooperation in the areas of training, technology, infrastructure development, project assistance and budgetary support.
As a part of our new initiative, we have started a Technology Park project here in Ramallah which is currently under construction.
After its creation, we hope that this institution will work as a center which enhances employment skills and services.
India is also collaborating to set up an Institute of Diplomacy in Ramallah.
We believe that this institute will emerge as a world-class training institute for the young diplomats of Palestine.
Our capacity building cooperation involves mutual training for long and short-term courses.
Training and scholarship slots for Palestine in leading Indian educational institutions of different sectors such as finance, management, rural development and information technology were recently extended.
I am happy that during this visit we are extending our development cooperation.
India will continue to invest in Palestine in the projects of health, educational infrastructure and women empowerment center and also in a printing press.
We consider this contribution as building blocks for the creation of an energetic Palestine State.
At the bilateral level, we have agreed to make our relations deeper through the Ministerial level Joint Commission Meeting.
Last year, for the first time, there was an exchange between the youth delegations of India and Palestine.
Investing in our youth and cooperating in their skill development and relationships is a shared priority.
India is also a young country like Palestine.
Our aspirations for the Palestinian youth are the same which we have for Indian youths and which offers opportunities for progress, prosperity and self-reliance.
They are our future and inheritors of our friendship.
I am happy to announce that we will increase the exchange of young persons from 50 to 100 from this year.
In our discussion today, I once again assured President Abbas that India is committed to take care of the interests of the Palestinian people.
India hopes that Palestine soon becomes a sovereign and independent country in a peaceful atmosphere.
President Abbas and I had discussions on recent regional and global developments related to the peace and security of Palestine and its peace process.
India greatly hopes for peace and stability in this region.
We believe that permanent solution to the issue of Palestine is ultimately contained in negotiations and understanding through which a path to a peaceful coexistence can be obtained.
Intense diplomacy and judiciousness alone can help to achieve freedom from this cycle of violence and from the burden of the history.
We know it is not easy.
But we must constantly keep on trying because there is so much at stake.
Your Excellency, I express my heartfelt gratitude for your wonderful hospitality.
I, on behalf of 1.25 billion Indians, also extend warm greetings for the progress and prosperity of the people of Palestine.

The Commission shall be known as the Commission to examine the sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes.
The proposed terms of references of the Commission are as follows:
(i) To examine the extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes/ communities included in the broad category of OBCs, with reference to the OBCs included in the Central list.
(ii) To work out the mechanism, criteria, norms and parameters, in a scientific approach, for sub-categorization within such OBCs, and,
(iii) To take up the exercise of identifying the respective castes/communities/ sub-castes/ synonyms in the Central List of OBCs and classifying them into their respective sub-categories.
The Supreme Court in its order dated 16.11.1992 in WP(C) No. 930/1990 (Indra Sawhney and others vs. Union of India) observed that there is no Constitutional or legal bar to a State categorizing backward classes as backward or more backward and had further observed that if a State chooses to do it (sub-categorization), it is not impermissible in law.
Nine States of the country viz., Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry, Karnataka, Haryana, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have already carried out sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes.

Friends, I have had the pleasure of interacting with renowned Scientists in the beginning of every year.
I am glad that today, an auspicious opportunity allows me to share some thoughts with you.
Today, we open a year-long celebration of the 125th year of Acharya Satyendra Nath Bose, who was born on this day in 1894.
I have learnt a great deal about his accomplishments that were far ahead of his times and society.
He succeeded despite many constraints.
These included the lack of formal research education, and little connectivity with the global scientific community.
His path-breaking work in 1924 was due to his single-minded devotion to uncharted science.
It laid the foundations of Quantum Statistics and a basis for modern Atomic Theory.
Einstein’s biographer Abraham Pace regarded his work as one of the last four revolutionary papers on old Quantum Theory.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose has been immortalized in the history of science by concepts and terms, like Bose Statistics, Bose Einstein Condensation and Higgs Boson.
The fundamental importance of his work may be gauged from the fact that several Nobel Prizes in Physics have been awarded subsequently to researchers carrying forward his ideas to diverse physical applications.
Professor Bose was a crusader for teaching of science in vernacular languages.
He started the Bengali science magazine Gyan-o-Bigyan.
To promote understanding and love of science in our youth, it is vital that we promote science communication in a big way.
Distinguished Scientists and Students, You all have studied and are probably also experts of Quantum Mechanics.
I have not studied it.
But I understand that there are many lessons that Physics can teach us in day to day life.
A classical particle cannot escape easily from inside a deep well.
But a quantum particle can!
For one reason or another, we have confined ourselves into isolation.
We hardly cooperate, collaborate and share our experiences with fellow scientists of other Institutions and National Laboratories.
To reach our true potential and to take Indian science to its rightful glory, we should be like a quantum particle that escapes its confinement.
This is even more important today, as Science becomes hugely multi-disciplinary and requires concerted efforts.
I have been talking about the need for greater sharing of physical and research infrastructure, which is expensive and has an increasingly short lifetime.
I am told that our science departments are now working on a multipronged approach.
I understand that a portal is being developed for sharing of scientific infrastructure that would allow transparent and efficient tagging and sharing of resources.
A mechanism is being put up for strong collaborations between academic and R&D institutions.
City based R&D Clusters are being created to bring together all Science and Technology partners from Academia to Institutes, to Industries to Startups.
The success of this effort, will depend on our ability to bring all institutions and labs under this strategy.
It requires whole-hearted support from each of us.
Our aim should be to ensure that the whole of our efforts and actions is always greater than the sum of the various parts.
Friends, for various reasons, we missed the first Industrial revolution.
We cannot miss similar opportunities today.
Upcoming sectors such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Cyber-physical systems, Genomics, and Electric Vehicles are new challenges that require your attention.
Please ensure, that as a country, we keep pace with these emerging technologies and innovations.
The way our scientific community tackles these challenges, will determine our success in smart manufacturing, smart cities, Industry 4.0, and the Internet-of-Things.
Our scientific ecosystem must connect directly with innovators and entrepreneurs to cultivate, channelize and empower them.

Indian Posts & Telecommunications Accounts and Finance Service Group ‘A” was constituted in 1972 and caters to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and the Department of Posts (DoP).
In the Department of Posts, the IP&TAFS is entrusted with the functions of finance advice, budgeting, tariff and costing, accounting and internal audit.
There has been a paradigm shift in the role of Department of Telecommunications as well as the Department of Posts in recent years.
In the Telecom sector, the role of the Department of Telecommunications has transformed from primarily being a Service provider, Regulator and Policy maker into the present structure whereby the Department is primarily responsible for Policy making, Licensing and Universal Service Obligation.
Receipts from Department of Telecommunications, primarily License Fee, Spectrum Usage Charges and Spectrum Auction Value constitute one of the largest source of non-tax revenue for the Government of India.
Similarly, the bundle of services offered by Department of Posts has undergone a quantitative and qualitative change and the Department has ventured into areas of retailing, banking, insurance, digitizing operations etc.
Further, the audit mechanism in both the Departments needs to be strengthened.

Rt. Hon. Theresa May, British Prime Minister made a telephone call to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
The two Prime Ministers exchanged greetings on the occasion of the festival of Diwali, celebrated recently.
Both leaders agreed that there is substantial scope for further strengthening bilateral cooperation across a range of sectors, including Science & Technology, Finance, Trade & Investment, and Defence & Security.
Thank you very much for your thoughts and recommendations on our global challenges and our bilateral cooperation.
Your perspectives are very important to us.
Let me reassure you that we will remain very sensitive to your concerns in international forums.
We would also like to shape our bilateral cooperation in accordance with your needs and priorities.
Let me share my thoughts with you on a few global issues and propose a few initiatives for our cooperation.
Climate change is clearly a pressing concern for all.
Combating it is India’s national priority.
We make this choice with the natural instinct of our heritage and culture.
But, we also do this in our enlightened self-interest and with a commitment to the future of our planet.
That is why we have set a target of additional capacity of 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022.
National action will succeed only through a strong international partnership.
As much as we speak of goals and emission reductions, we should focus equally on access to affordable technology and adequate finance that makes transition to clean energy natural and easy.
Otherwise, experience shows that targets will remain difficult dreams.
We must equally seek a global commitment to support adaptation to the growing impact of climate change on our lives and economy.
India will work with you and others for a comprehensive, balanced and fair outcome at COP 21 in Paris.
Your interests will have the strength of our voice.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, reforms of the UN Security Council is in global interest and vital for a more inclusive and equitable world.
We look forward to working with you to realise the full potential of our oceans in a sustainable manner.
We could begin immediately with research collaboration and capacity building with institutions in India.
We also propose to hold an International Conference on “Ocean economy and Pacific Island Countries” in New Delhi in 2016.
We will be delighted to host officials and independent experts of all 14 Pacific Island Countries.
Indian Navy has provided direct support and capacity building to island states in Indian Ocean, especially for coastal surveillance and hydrographic surveys.
We would be prepared to extend this assistance to our Pacific Island partners.
We also look forward to goodwill visits by Indian Navy to Pacific Islands.
The ships could also extend support in areas like healthcare through medical camps on the islands.
Not only is our future closely linked to Space and Oceans, there is also a close relationship between the two.
Fiji’s support was invaluable for our Mars Mission.
We hope to continue receiving support from Pacific Islands for Telemetry, Tracking and Command for our missions in the future.
In addition, we will offer two scholarships for college education in India to each of the 13 countries that do not receive them yet, while continuing with the 33 scholarships presently offered to Fiji.
We will expand our training courses for Pacific Island diplomats and, in addition, offer a two-week business management course at the globally renowned Indian Institute of Management in Bengaluru.
During the last three years, India has trained 43 rural women from 8 island countries as solar engineers.
This will save kerosene worth about a million US dollars and provide livelihood to women.
I am pleased to announce that we will establish at least one information technology laboratory in each Pacific Island country.
This will not only improve local IT infrastructure, it will enable us to fulfill our commitment to provide tele-medicine and tele-education to the people.
We are prepared to do more to strengthen our trade.
Supply of generic drugs from India is presently routed through third countries and are, therefore, very expensive.
We are ready to set up a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant and distribution centre in the Pacific Island region and are pleased to offer a Line of Credit for this project.
Human bonds are the strongest foundation for enduring relations between nations.
Last year, we had announced electronic visas for Pacific Island countries.
I am pleased to announce that we have decided to provide gratis visa to the nationals of Pacific Island countries.
Prasar Bharti, India’s national broadcaster is happy to gift television and radio programmes on culture, entertainment, news, education, etc., in English and Hindi to your countries.
Prasar Bharati also proposes to organise a specialised training programme over the next few months for broadcasters from the Pacific Island Countries.
We will also support creation of India Centres through e-libraries and supply books to libraries at universities in your countries.
In the short time together, we have made concrete progress.
Together, we are highlighting the value of relationships, based on goodwill, respect and concern for each other.
This partnership demonstrates that geography is no barrier to productive partnerships of convergent interests and shared challenges.
This partnership will be of great relevance to all of us in the 21st century.
Your support to this partnership means a lot to India.
We see this as a partnership of equals, driven by similar aspirations, in which we will all be more successful by being together.
We hope that this would inspire you to visit us more often.
I congratulate President Ramaphosa on the success of BRICS Summit in Johannesburg in July and hosting this meeting.
In BRICS we represent 42% of the world’s population.
Since last few years BRICS has been the engine of Global Growth.
However, there are still many possibilities of increasing our share in world GDP (23%) and trade (16%).
They are not in line with our population.
Globalization has brought millions of people out of poverty.
However, we have challenges of equal distribution of benefits of globalization before us.
There has been a streak of continuous difficulties in the path of multilateralism and rule-based world order and protectionism is increasing.
Currency devaluation and sharp increase in oil prices are challenging the profits earned over the past few years.
BRICS countries have been contributing to global sustainability and development.
We have played an important role in shaping the economic and political structure of the world.
We have made significant contributions in making the architecture of global economic governance more representative and democratic and we will continue to work further in this direction.
This is the purpose for which we have come together in the BRICS.
In this regard, I have suggested ‘Reformed Multilateralism’ in my meeting in Johannesburg.
Inclusion of topics like the New Industrial Revolution, future of work, etc. in the G20 agenda has enriched the discussion of global development.
We, BRICS countries, are eager to cooperate in the new Industrial Revolution.
In this context, the topics of globalization and migration must be addressed through better multilateral coordination and cooperation.
Managing labor issues in the Global Supply Chain will be necessary to ensure excellent work in the entire value chain.
Portability of social security schemes of workers and smooth movement of laborers worldwide is very important.
Social-economic issues like women’s empowerment and sustainable food future will be raised in the G20 Summit.
On sustainable development and infrastructure, earlier I had suggested the need for disaster resilient infrastructure.
We have to work together to take it forward.
India values and appreciates the progress made in enhancing BRICS political exchanges.
In this regard, meetings between our Foreign Ministers, NSAs and special messengers from Middle East have made important contributions.
We all agree that terrorism and radicalization are the biggest threats that the whole world is facing today.
It is not only a threat to the peace and security, it is also a threat to economic development.
We have urged all countries for the implementation of FATF standards.
Our support base in the G20 has started to become strong.
Our BRICS Sherpas have been consulting and cooperating in G20 areas.
G20 Summit is being headed by a developing country.
It is a good opportunity that the focus of the G20 agenda and its results should be brought to the priorities of the developing countries.
In the end, once again I thank President Ramaphosa for the successful hosting of the Johannesburg Summit and for organizing this meeting.
I also confirm full support and cooperation of India to Brazil and its leadership for the forthcoming BRICS Chairmanship.
I am confident that BRICS cooperation will scale new heights under the Chairmanship of Brazil.
I also thank President of Brazil that we have been getting your guidance and an opportunity to work with you since the last six times and as you said, this is our last meeting with you.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of Former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
My thoughts are with his family, BJP Karyakartas and millions of admirers in this hour of sadness.
I will particularly remember his sharp intellect and outstanding wit.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has bowed to Shaheed Bhagat Singh, on his birth anniversary.
“I bow to the brave Shaheed Bhagat Singh on his Jayanti.
His greatness and exemplary courage inspires generations of Indians”, the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its ex-post facto approval for signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) among BRICS countries on BRICS Network University.
The negotiations were held on this during the 3rd BRICS Education Ministers meeting and Senior Officials meeting in November, 2015 at Mosco, Russia.
The MoU will help in developing pro-active cooperation among the BRICS nations for the purpose of enhancement of scientific research, higher education, information exchange, analysis and implementation of best practices, joint research programmes, and mobility of students, researchers and educators.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the people of country on the occasion of Akshay Tritiya.
“Greetings on Akshay Tritiya.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today reviewed the progress of the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY).
Senior Government officials briefed him on aspects such as addressing of debt, monitoring frameworks, improvement in financial parameters, operational achievements, and consumer empowerment.
He also called for greater coordination between all mineral-related departments during the survey and mapping of geological potential regions.
Union Minister Shri Piyush Goyal, and senior officials from PMO, NITI Aayog and other Ministries were present during the meeting.
Respected senior dignitaries seated on the dais, brothers and sisters, Sai Ram.
He is never worried; sometimes some names are left.
You heard the speech of Venkaiah Ji like super fast express.
A short while ago, Raman Singh Ji was describing that Modi ji has started on Sunday which is a holiday.
For me it is holiday in real sense.
About holiday, I say its holy day.
We should do all the work that is possible on that day.
When I go to bed at night I would have completed my visit to five states today.
And everyone should try.
Today, I had the opportunity to unveil the statue of Sai Baba.
Those who would have gone to Puttaparthi must have seen the big hospital.
I would like to point out that less attention was paid to the social works done by Sai Baba while miracles were talked about more.
The work he had done in the area of water supply, education and health are indeed very inspiring.
Even if we do not talk of any miracle, these works are miracles in themselves.
I do not talk of any miracle.
Speaking of a miracle in itself is a huge miracle.
I salute the great social works of Sai Baba.
Today the draft of a new policy was presented before you on innovation and Entrepreneurship.
I congratulate Raman Singh and his government for their thinking in this direction.
It has a blueprint of what government can do, what government will do, what people should do and what people and government can do together.
If we look towards the countries which have progressed in past 50 year then we will find that at the core of their progress lies the innovation.
They brought about many new things.
They came out with several new ideas which wer later accepted by the world.
That innovation became beneficial for the society and became the reason behind economic progress of that country.
If there is no innovation, the nation comes to a halt.
It causes interruption.
The very nature of the life should be ever changing with times.
The tradition of innovation should be maintained.
We should work for new innovations which are useful to the society and community.
The world is watching this demographic division as a major power.
However, if we continue to just recite the rosary of demographic division that our 65 percent population is below 35 years of age, then it is not going to work.
This 65 percent of population should be skilled.
There should be economic management for displaying skill.
The Government policies should be encouraging these small entrepreneurs.
This could be the environment in the country.
The scheme formulated by the Government emphasize on all these things.
Simply being a graduate and move around looking for job with certificates could not be the life of youths of my country.
The environment of my country should be conducive to help realize the dreams of life for my youth.
The Government has taken steps one after another in this direction to fulfill their dreams and ambitions.
Skill Development provides skilling opportunities to the youth of the country.
‘Mudra Yojna’ is financing scheme for new entrepreneurs and even for the old who want to expand.
Remember this doesn’t require any guarantee for such people who couldn’t even go to the banks.
Money lenders fleeced them.
The interest was enormous.
Some time he had to flee from his village and at times to leave the world.
Mudra scheme has been formulated to save him from the clutches of money lenders.
So far, 20 million people have been granted funds and almost one million billion rupees has been dispensed to them without seeking any form of guarantee.
The idea here is that they expand their businesses and provide employment to poor people.
They provide employment to one, two, four people and this is going to create job opportunities.
There is prevailing belief in the world that for economic growth the push will come from the private sector and the public sector entities like government PSUs or corporate houses.
For a country like India, yet another mode is required which is the personal sector.
The State has come with this policy today to give a fillip to entrepreneurship.
He should get finance from ‘Mudra Yojna’, get skill from Skill Development Program and then an environment of positive market should be created.
I’m glad that of out of two billion people who received help, almost 70 percent are from SCs, STs or OBCs.
Women Entrepreneurs have also come forward in very large numbers.
The force being created and the policies which Chattisgarh government has come up with together shall be of great value.
When Central and State Governments power unite, the development comes very rapidly.
And I believe that the youth of Chhattisgarh will be benefited.
‘Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojna’ is also being launched today.
After so many years of independence there are around five billion households who need housing facility.
Nearly 20 million are in the cities and 30 million live in the villages.
These are the people for whom it is not possible to build a house on their own.
Neither do they have land nor the money.
Systems sometime play a big role for development.
There is no environment for the family nor he has the dreams.
But if he is given a small house, he is willing to pay back.
If government and banks extend help, this model of public private partnership can move forward.
Once he has the house, second thing comes to his mind.
If guests come, there should be something at the entrance to wipe the feet.
Then he saves 10 rupees and gets a doormat.
Hence I would like to point out that the ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ is not an Infrastructure.
It is not meant to create walls or to provide land.
It is a big program to fulfill the dreams and aspirations of the people.
Even for the poorest of the poor in India and every individual, there is a desire to have his own house.
However, the desires of the poor are never fulfilled.
No poor wants to give poverty to their children in inheritance.
He also wants to give them something.
Government has a dream for such people to help them fulfill their dreams.
It will be 75 years of India’s independence in 2022.
It is quite a task since 50 million households are to be created by 2022.
Lots of human resources will be required.
But it will also increase the employment opportunities.
Cement, iron, brick, clay all will be sold more.
There will be more work for the workers.
We will be a witness to a major economic trend in coming days for the young generation.
Center is ready to pursue this work.
State and Central Government will do this work together and provide shelter to poorest of poor of this country.
His dreams will get a new life with this shelter.
And with those dreams the country will scale new heights in 2022.
I believe that this dream shall come true.
Your Majesties, Chairperson of the African Union, His Excellency Robert Mugabe Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Madam Dlamini-Zuma, Excellencies,
The fabric of this world is richer because of the 54 sovereign flags of Africa.
Today, their brilliant colours have made Delhi the most special place in the world.
From the south, where the conscience of our age has been forged – from Mahatma Gandhi to Albert Luthuli to Nelson Mandela;
A very warm embrace of welcome and friendship from India.
Today, the dreams of one-third of humanity have come together under one roof.
Today, the heart beat of 1.25 billion Indians and 1.25 billion Africans are in rhythm.
We are among the world’s oldest civilisations.
We are each a vibrant mosaic of languages, religions and cultures.
Generations of Indians and Africans have travelled to each other’s land in search of their destiny or by the force of circumstances.
Either way, we have enriched each other and strengthened our ties.
We have lived in the long shadow of colonialism.
And, we have fought together against hunger and disease.
And, as we look to the future, there is something precious that unites us: it is our youth.
Two-thirds of India and two-thirds of Africa is under the age of 35 years.
We are all familiar with Africa’s ancient achievements.
Now, its modern strides are catching the attention of the world.
The continent is more settled and stable.
African nations are coming together to take responsibility for their development, peace and security.
African struggles and sacrifices are upholding democracy, combating extremism and empowering women.
Women now constitute around 20% of the elected Members of Parliament in Africa.
To one who has played a role in that, President Sirleaf, I extend our best wishes on your birthday today.
Africa’s economic growth has gathered momentum and has a more diversified base.
African initiatives are replacing old fault lines with new bridges of regional economic integration.
We see many successful examples of economic reforms, infrastructure development and sustainable use of resources.
Africa is now joining the global mainstream of innovation.
The mobile banking of M-Pesa, the healthcare innovation of MedAfrica, or the agriculture innovation of AgriManagr and Kilimo Salama, are using mobile and digital technology to transform lives in Africa.
We see strong measures that are radically improving healthcare, education and agriculture.
Primary school enrolment in Africa now exceeds 90%.
And, across its magnificent landscape, Africa is setting standards in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism.
Africa’s sports, art and music delight the entire world.
Yes, Africa, like the rest of the developing world, has its development challenges.
And, like others in the world, it has its own concerns of security and stability, especially from terrorism and extremism.
But, I have confidence in African leadership and the African people to rise to those challenges.
for the past six decades, so much of our independent journeys have been together.
Now, so much of India’s development priorities and Africa’s lofty vision for its future are aligned.
Today, Africa and India are two bright spots of hope and opportunities in the global economy.
India is honoured to be a development partner for Africa.
It is a partnership beyond strategic concerns and economic benefits.
It is formed from the emotional bonds we share and the solidarity we feel for each other.
In less than a decade, our trade has more than doubled to over 70 billion dollars.
India is now a major source of business investments in Africa.
Today, 34 African countries enjoy duty free access to the Indian market.
India has committed 7.4 billion dollars in concessional credit and 1.2 billion dollars in grant since the first India-Africa Summit in 2008.
It is creating 100 capacity building institutions, and developing infrastructure, public transport, clean energy, irrigation, agriculture and manufacturing capacity across Africa.
In the last three years alone, nearly 25,000 young Africans have been trained and educated in India.
They are the 25,000 new links between us.
There are times when we have not done as well as you have wanted us to.
There have been occasions when we have not been as attentive as we should be.
There are commitments we have not fulfilled as quickly as we should have.
But, you have always embraced India with warmth, and without judgement.
You have rejoiced in our success, and taken pride in our achievements.
And, you have stood for us in the world.
This is the strength of our partnership and our friendship.
And, as we travel on the road ahead, we will do so with the wisdom of our experience and the benefit of your guidance.
So, development of human capital in every walk of life will be at the heart of our partnership.
We will open our doors more;we will expand tele-education; and we will continue to build institutions in Africa.
The Egyptian Nobel Prize winning writer Naguib Mahfouz said, “Science brings people together with the light of its ideas…and prods us towards a better future.”
There can be no better expression of the ability of science to unify people and advance progress.
So, technology will be a strong foundation of our partnership.
It will help develop Africa’s agriculture sector.
We will also collaborate to develop Indian and African treasures of traditional knowledge and medicines.
We will make available our space assets and technology.
This will alsohelp set up your Pan Africa Virtual University.
We will work to reduce digital divide within Africa and between Africa and rest of the world.
When the sun sets, tens of millions of homes in India and Africa become dark.
But, it is also true that the excess of few cannot become the burden of many.
So, when the world meets in Paris in December, we look to see a comprehensive and concrete outcome that is based on the well established principles in the UN Convention on Climate Change.
We will all do our part for it.
But, we also want to see a genuine global public partnership that makes clean energy affordable; provides finance and technology to developing countries to access it; and the means to adapt to the impact of climate change.
When we meet at Nairobi Ministerial of the WTO in December, we must ensure that the Doha Development Agenda of 2001 is not closed without achieving these fundamental objectives.
We should also achieve a permanent solution on public stock holding for food security and special safeguard mechanism in agriculture for the developing countries.
This is a milestone year when we are setting the agenda for our future and celebrating the 70th anniversary of the United Nations.
That is why India advocates reforms in global institutions.
This is a world of free nations and awakened aspirations.
That is why India and Africa must speak in one voice for reforms of the United Nations, including its Security Council.
Today, in many parts of the world, the light of a bright future flickers in the storm of violence and instability.
When terror snuffs out life on the streets and beaches, and in malls and schools of Africa, we feel your pain as our own.
And, we see the links that unite us against this threat.
We also see that when our oceans are no longer safe for trade, we all suffer together.
And, when Nations are caught in conflict within, no one around remains untouched.
And, we know that our cyber networks bring opportunities, but also carry huge risks.
So, when it comes to security, distance no longer insulates us from each other.
We will also provide support for Africa Union’s peacekeeping efforts.
And, we will train African peacekeepers here and in Africa.
We must also have a stronger voice in decisions on UN Peacekeeping Missions.
From connecting lives to collaborating for our prosperity, from keeping our people safe to advancing our global interests, the agenda of our partnership stretches across the vast territory of our linked aspirations.
To add strength to our partnership, India will offer concessional credit of 10 billion U.S. dollars over the next five years.
This will be in addition to our ongoing credit programme.
We will also offer a grant assistance of 600 million U.S. dollars.
This will include an India-Africa Development Fund of 100 million U.S. dollars and an India-Africa Health Fund of 10 million U.S. dollars.
It will also include 50,000 scholarships in India over the next five years.
And, it will support the expansion of the Pan Africa E-Network and institutions of skilling, training and learning across Africa.
If this century is going to be one in which all humans have a life of opportunity, equality and dignity; stand in peace with each other; and live in balance with nature, then India and Africa must rise together.
We will work together:
From the memory of our common struggles; and, the tide of our collective hopes;
From the richness of our heritage; and, the commitment to our planet;
From the pledge to our people; and, the faith in our future;
From the generosity of the African saying that a small home can hold hundred friends;
From the spirit of India’s ancient belief: सन्तः स्वयं परहिते निहिताभियोगाः that great souls are always taking the initiatives to do good to others;
From the inspiration of Mandela’s call to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.
But, this is a new promise of a great future for an ancient relationship.
Your presence here today, Your Majesties and Excellencies, is the strongest proof of our resolve and our commitment.
Today, we are the fastest growing economy in the world.
Powered by the Hundred and Twenty Five Crore people of India, we will grow even faster.
As per an international report, poverty is declining in India at a record pace.
5 crore people have moved out of poverty in the last two years according to the report.
Who do you think is making this possible?
It is the people of India.
The Government can only play the role of an enabler.
It is the youth, who are not only making use of available opportunities but also creating new ones themselves.
This is our new India.
This is a big number.
Who’s at the lead of this?
Young doctors, nurses, support staff and volunteers.
India built 1.75 lakh kilometres of rural roads in the last 4 years.
Who built them?
Young labourers and workers.
India made electricity reach every single village in the last 4 years.
Eighteen thousand villages were electrified and this target was completed on time.
Now, we are electrifying every home.
Eighty Five lakh homes have been electrified since October 2017.
Who brightened the homes of their fellow citizens?
Young Electricians and Technicians.
Who made 4 crore and 65 lakhs gas connections reach the poor?
Yet again, India’s youth.
And, they did this not for themselves but out of care and concern towards poor women, many of whom live in rural areas.
More than one crore homes have been built for the poor in the last 4 years.
Who did it?
It was young engineers, masons and labourers who made this possible.
These numbers are mostly only in crores!
They are big numbers.
Why are these big numbers possible?
In fact, there are such youngsters bringing home medals and records.
They overcame steep odds, showed great determination and achieved great heights.
Those bringing home the medals are from smaller towns.
They belong to simple middle class or neo-middle class families.
Young India feels “Anything is possible!
Everything is achievable.”
India needs more skilled manpower Skill India is for that.
India needs villages connected with i-ways we have laid 2.7 lakh km of optical fiber network connecting more than a lakh gram panchayats.
India needs more entrepreneurs Mudra and Standup India are for that.
India needs affordable healthcare आयुष्मान भारत is for that.
India needs its startup generation to prosper today you can register a startup very quickly.
There is a level playing field in public procurement for startups too!
Friends, when development is our only aim, we remain sensitive to people’s concerns and aspirations.
When we are receptive to people, it reflects in policies becoming simpler.
When we remove red-tape and make policies easier, we bring more FDI.
When we bring more FDI, we create more industries in India.
When we create more industries, we create more employment opportunities.
When we create more employment opportunities, we empower the youth to improve his future.
Friends, New India is that land, Where you make your name, your name does not make you.
Where your ideas matter, not your influence.
Where opportunities beckon instead of obstacles.
Where 125 crore Indians write their own destiny instead of being left to their own fate.
This is our New India!

The rationale for the proposed amendments are:
There is reportedly no such community.

Interacting with members of the NITI Aayog, the Prime Minister said the time for incremental change, that was the norm across the world for quite some time, is now over.
He said the current age is one that requires transformational change.
He highlighted the importance of technology as an emerging driver of change over the last three decades, and asserted that this pace of change would not slacken.
The Prime Minister asserted that the Union Government has the courage and the ability to deliver transformational change for bettering the lives of the people.
He pointed out that, historically, Indian policy-makers had tended to lament its constraints rather than play to its strengths.
Laying out the broad contours of India’s development path, the Prime Minister said that judicious and intelligent application of India’s natural resources and human resources, would be at the heart of this change.
Giving several illustrations of this theme, he mentioned use of available land, the country’s mineral wealth, and vast untapped solar energy potential.
In a similar way, he said India has made sub-optimal use so far of its vast coastline.
Turning to Agriculture, the Prime Minister said the focus cannot be on increasing agricultural productivity alone, but should be on the overall development of a vibrant rural economy.
He emphasized the importance of the food processing sector, warehouse development, and technology inputs, in this sector.
The Prime Minister said that the intentions (niyat) of the policy-makers are even more important than the policies (niti) themselves.
Stressing on the need to build capacities for good governance, he highlighted the importance of real-time data availability.
The meeting was attended by the Minister of State for Planning, Shri Rao Inderjit Singh, the Vice Chairman of the NITI Aayog Shri Arvind Panagariya, and Members of the NITI Aayog, besides senior officers from the NITI Aayog, PMO and Cabinet Secretariat.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has expressed condolences on the passing away of Mr. George Fernandes.
The Prime Minister said, “George Sahab represented the best of India’s political leadership.
Frank and fearless, forthright and farsighted, he made a valuable contribution to our country.
He was among the most effective voices for the rights of the poor and marginalised.
When we think of Mr. George Fernandes, we remember most notably the fiery trade union leader who fought for justice, the leader who could humble the mightiest of politicians at the hustings, a visionary Railway Minister and a great Defence Minister who made India safe and strong.
During his long years in public life, George Sahab never deviated from his political ideology.
He resisted the Emergency tooth and nail.
His simplicity and humility were noteworthy.
My thoughts are with his family, friends and lakhs of people grieving.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today reviewed the progress towards holistic development of islands.
The Union Government had constituted the Islands Development Agency on June 1st, 2017.

He said the Indian Armed Forces rank among the best in the world on parameters such as discipline and conduct.
India is one of the foremost contributors to peace keeping forces worldwide, he added.
He recalled that during the recent crisis in Yemen, the Indian Armed Forces had evacuated not just thousands of Indian citizens, but citizens of other nations as well.
Noting that Indians had never coveted territories of other nations, the Prime Minister emphasized that when the time came to protect human values, the Indian Armed Forces never failed to rise to the occasion.
He recalled that the World Wars were not India’s wars, but so many Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives defending foreign lands.
He said we must not forget, and we should also make sure that the world does not forget, these sacrifices made by the jawans.
He said the strength of the Indian Armed Forces is the morale of its jawans, which comes from the support of 125 crore Indians.
Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, the Prime Minister said, appreciating the valour of the jawans guarding the nation’s borders.
The Prime Minister quoted Hindi poets Makhanlal Chaturvedi and Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, praising the glorious traditions of sacrifice of the Indian Armed Forces.
One is not done with one festival, in the mean time the second one comes along.
Many villages receive an electric pole after so many years of Independence.
Those of us who live in cities and are so accustomed to using electricity that we don’t realize the extent of happiness and excitement when darkness is removed from our lives.
The power department of the state and Indian government were functional earlier as well but from the day 1000 day target to provide electricity to every village has been set, we get news everyday that power supply is available in some or the other village and the happiness of the inhabitants’ knows no bounds.
Be it the farmers, poor, young or women, should such things reach them or not?
Everything should be new, new ways and new thinking – after all the world does not move ahead without innovation.
Can you give me suggestions regarding this youth festival?
So I will wait dear friends for your suggestions on the youth festival on the “Narendra Modi App”.
And the students’ response was fantastic, we enjoyed in the school and the students were inspired and motivated to help the disabled people in the society.
I think it was a great initiative by you.”
So I thought why not use the term ‘Divyang’ instead of ‘viklang’ in our country.
The schemes should be operational till the last mile individual has benefitted from them.
Crores of rupees were spent on it but we did not know if it reached the right people or not, if this subsidy reached people on time or not?
This scheme is known as ‘Pahal’ and this experiment has been very successful.
There were complaints about student scholarships too; they too are being transferred into their accounts.
But at least let’s start with discussions.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to M/s.
HLL Lifecare Ltd., a Mini Ratna PSU under Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to sub- lease 330.10 acres of land at.
The proposed Medipark would contribute to the development of medical devices and technology sector and allied disciplines in the country, which is still at a nascent stage besides generating employment and give a boost to the government’s “Make in India” Campaign.
Medipark will be developed in phases, spread over seven years for completion.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired a high-level meeting to review progress with regard to “Ease of Doing Business.”

Subjects such as construction permits, enforcement of contracts, registering property, starting a business, getting electricity, getting credit, and resolving insolvency came up for discussion.
India’s rise in the World Bank “Doing Business” rankings from 142 to 77, over the last four years, was taken note of.
Officials explained the steps being taken to plug shortcomings and resolve bottlenecks in implementing business reforms.
The Prime Minister stressed on the need to improve last mile delivery, and focus on streamlining procedures, which would improve not just the “Doing Business” rankings, but also increase the “Ease of Living” for small businesses and the common man.
He said this is extremely important for India, as an emerging and vibrant economy.
He also spoke of the tremendous global interest about the rise in India’s “Doing Business” rankings.
In 1917, आचार्य जगदीश चंद्र बोस established India’s first dedicated Scientific Research Centre, the Bose Institute of Calcutta.
His inaugural speech was a reflection of his holistic views of science.
He said,“I dedicate today this institute not merely a laboratory but a temple to the nation”.
The live and works of hundred of Indian Scientists are a compelling testament of integration of deep fundamental insights with technology development and nation building.
Twenty years ago in a historic address at Pokhran, our great Prime Mnister Atal Ji had recognized the contributions of science and technology for India.
I believe it is now time to take one more step forward.
Indeed the pursuit of vigyan is fulfilled through achievement of two objectives.
The first is, generation of profound or disruptive knowledge.
The second is consumption of that knowledge for socio economic good.
As we push our discovery science eco-system, we must also focus on innovation and startups.
Our government has launched the Atal Innovation Mission to promote innovation among our scientists.
More technology business incubators have been established in the last four years then in the forty year before that.
Industry must now contribute by providing timely direction, vision, mentorship and partnership to the Startups.

Greetings!
Shriman Nilesh Vikamse, President, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley Ji, my colleagues from the Council of Ministers, dignitaries from the Chartered Accountants field who have joined me on live streaming from almost 200 locations countrywide, the Chief Ministers joining us from respective states, and the enthusiastic fraternity here braving the Delhi rains.
A very warm welcome to you all!
The achievers being felicitated tonight on this auspicious occasion, all of you who have assembled here today from various locations, business and industry stalwarts, fellow citizens, youngsters connected through TV, radio, Ladies and gentlemen.
It is indeed a matter of happiness and privilege that I am amidst you on such a historical day.
Let me tell, you have significantly contributed as Chartered Accountants over the past decades and you all have been given a solemn right by the government.
Its only your fraternity which is authorized to Certify and Audit the entries in Account books and confirm whether they are correct or manipulated.
In a way it is indeed a great opportunity for me to learn and share with you today.
Chartered Accountants of India have earned laurels across the globe for their dexterity in Financial Skills.
In the wake of globalisation, we have to focus now on developing dynamic systems so that our institutions are able to produce dynamic human resources.
In order to remain relevant to the industry, we should design our courses according to the global requirements and benchmarks.
Our courses must integrate technological requirements in the field of Accountancy.
We should encourage innovation in the Accountant’s Field.
We should find ways to innovate Charted Nutral Firms Technology.
There is a huge opportunity in the market for new Software which is required in the field of accountancy.
Friends, our scriptures have laid down four Purusharthas-the objects of human pursuits.
These include- Dharma (righteousness, moral values) Artha (economic values), Kaama (psychological values), Moksha (spiritual values).
I am indebted to you for having allowed me to share my thoughts with you.
But, let us face some harsh realities!
Within no time they bounce back.
Dear friends, you are engaged in setting the accounts right If we are righteous, the country can be salvaged from the biggest of crises.
During the worst of the natural calamities like floods and earthquakes, the citizens have shown their capabilities to take care of the cause of the nation while supporting the administration.
However, if some of the citizens of the country are into the habit of stealing and pilferage, it leads to an irreparable damage to the family and the nation.
Dreams are shattered and it causes road blocks in the development of the nation.
Government has cracked down heavily to nab such pilferers over the past three years.
We have MOUs and agreements with several nations which have been amended accordingly.
The latest statistics from Swiss bank accounts stand a testimony to the strict measures by the government on the Black Money issue.
Three decades back in 1987, these officials from Swiss Banks had started declaring how much deposits were being made by nationals of a country.
According to the reports released for the last financial year, there has been a reduction of 45% in the deposits made by Indians in the Swiss banks..
Ladies and gentlemen, two years later when we shall start receiving real time data from Switzerland, imagine the plight of the black money holders.
I am sure you do not have such money in your possession.
However, I am sure the love for nation will make you sound those who have amassed black money.
Friends, while I am endorsing Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
I have also started the process of cleansing of the economic and financial systems of the country.
I am sure 8th November is ingrained deep in your minds.
Demonetization was a firm and landmark step to wipe out the black money and corruption from our systems.
Let me share with you, I have heard that since 8th November you all have been immersed in more work like never before in your careers.
But you did burn the midnight oil in those days!
Friends, for the first time I would like to share my thoughts on this drive of eradicating the black money because you all are aware of the strength of this mission.
My dear friends, I have already said that your patriotism is no less than mine.
For the first time I would like to reveal something to you that would startle the whole country.
Whatever data mining has been done till now has revealed that the transactions of more than 3 lakh companies – registered companies are under the radar of suspicion.
A lot of data mining is still left; so I really don’t know what will be the actual figure!
Some serious things have come to light after this process began.
I am telling you these things with the hope that you might connect with the thoughts of this government and the strength of the politicians.
The names of those companies have been removed from the Registrar of Companies.
This is not an ordinary decision, friends.
People who take calculative steps only through the prism of politics, cannot take such decisions.
Only those who live for the sake of national interest can make such decisions.
The power to eliminate one lakh companies with the stroke of a pen can come only from the inspiration of patriotism.
Those who have looted the poor will have to return that to the poor.
Apart from this, the government has already identified more than 37 thousand Shell companies who are engaged in hiding black money and hawala transactions.
Stern actions shall be taken against them.
More stringent actions are in store for the companies who will break the law in future.
After demonetization, someone definitely might have helped those companies.
These thieves and robbers must have gone to some economic doctor.
I know very well that those companies might not have come to any of you for this purpose.
Don’t you feel the need to identify such people, who are sitting among you, who supported these companies?
Friends, I have been told that there are more than two lakh 72 thousand Chartered Accountants in our country.
And if we add all those chartered accountants and ‘articled assistants’ and all your staff then roughly these numbers will be more than eight lakhs.
Your family is more than 8 lakhs in this field, I mean, in your profession.
I would place some more facts for you since you grasp things quickly from the figures.
These professions are perceived to be the cream professions or are highly respectable jobs.
There are crores of people in such professions in our country.
Moreover, there are crores of palatial houses built in the cities of our country.
Also, about two crore 18 lakh people had travelled abroad last year.
These figures may astonish you; yet only 32 lakh people in our country say that their income is more than ten lakhs while filing tax returns.
Can any one of you believe it?
I am asking you, the corrector of the account books.
Are there only 32 lakh people in this country who earn more than 10 lakhs?
This is the bitter truth of our country, my beloved companions.
Besides this, what is the actual situation in the country?
And so brothers I do not want to project data further.
But by this you will understand that crores of vehicles are purchased every year in the country.
And yet the responsibilities towards the country are not getting fulfilled; it is a matter of grave concern.
Instead of referring to more data, I want to put my thoughts before you.
CA brothers, a person or a client pays taxes only when the environment around him is conducive which motivates him to pay the taxes honestly.
If he sees that the advisor himself is asking him to hide the truth then he will boldly traverse the wrong path.
Thus it is equally important to identify such wrong advisors and take strict actions against them.
CA is an arrangement in which Human Resource Development (HR) is done only by you.
Curriculum is made by you only; you conduct the exam; Rules and Regulations are also made by you, and your institute only punishes the culprits.
Did only 25 people make a mess?
And I have heard that more than 1400 cases are still pending for many years now.
Most of those professionals were lawyers.
These Barristers, in large numbers, took the cudgel of freedom struggle.
They knew the law.
They were aware of the consequences of fighting against the law.
Despite this, all the lawyers of that era who had well flourishing law profession left their advocacy for this country.
Inspired by patriotism, they dedicated their lives for the country’s independence.
Many of them played a decisive role in framing of our constitution.
Friends, today our country is at another crucial juncture of history.
After the country’s political integration in 1947, today the country is getting economically integrated.
Try to fathom my feelings, friends.
During the freedom movement, the lawyers had placed their lives at stake for the freedom of India.
Today, I am not asking you all to put your lives at stake.
You do not have to go behind the bars.
This country is yours; also the future of this country is your children’s.
Hence the reins of leadership of this new era have to be in your hands, just as the movement for freedom was led by those lawyers.
Today the economic development will be led by the army of my Chartered Accountants.
And you can see that no one but you can make this road to the greater economic development stronger.
To eliminate corruption, you have to take the command.
Friends, Chartered Accountants are like ambassadors of any country’s economic system.
Your signature is more powerful than that of a Prime Minister.
Your signature is a testimony to the trust in the truth.
Companies may be small or big, however, if you certify their books of account then the government believes in that, people of the country believe in that.
And have you ever thought that once you have signed a balance sheet then no one questions the balance sheet of that company; files are not held up after that.
Friends, a new chapter begins after that.
Today, I’ve come here to showcase that new life to you people.
If you certify the account books of a company then the government officers trust in your assessment.
The company grows, it flourishes and you people also grow, flourish with that.
Friends, however, the matter doesn’t end there.
Hence I appeal to you, I appeal to all of you because one-hundred and twenty-five crore people of India have faith in your signature.
If you feel deep down in your hearts that trust has been breached, then please come forward, please take initiative to restore that trust.
You yourself will realise the pride that the society will have in you.
Friends, there are different definitions for the term ‘tax return’.
However, I feel that whatever taxes are collected by a government whether those taxes have been utilised in the development of the country or not?
The money collected through taxes is being used for those brave soldiers who risk their lives on the border to protect us.
This money is being used in providing electricity to those households that don’t have electricity supply even after seventy years of independence.
Not a single bulb was ever illuminated in their homes; they have been living without electricity.
What could be a greater service than helping the country’s poor in providing what is due to them.
You could have never imagined that how just one signature of yours can help the poor people of this country.
You have huge responsibility in fulfilling the dreams of a common man of this country; you can play an important role in it.
And once you decide then I’m confident that the 1st of July 2017 will certainly become a turning point in the history of ICAI.
And, friends, once you take a vow then I can say with confidence that nobody will try to evade taxes.
People only break laws when they know that there is someone to protect them.
I congratulate him, I offer my gratitude.
You please reach out to the people, enlighten them.
Encourage them to join the mainstream of integrity.
In a way, the government has provided a fresh opportunity to the people in the field of chartered accountancy.
Please prepare yourself for this; I specifically urge the young professionals in this field.
Under this code when a company has been declared bankrupt then its control will be passed on to an insolvency practitioner.
However, whichever path you people choose today, in that path, the term CA should mean Charter and Accuracy, Compliance and Authenticity.
Friends, our country is going to complete 75 years of its independence in 2022.
The country has set some targets for the year 2022.
New India has been expecting hard work and industry from all of us.
What kind of India we want to see when it completes 75 years of its independence as an institute, as a chartered accountant, as an individual and also as a citizen and play our role, contribute in making the country like that.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India will complete 75 years of its existence two years after India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022.
You people should prepare the programme on the occasion of 75 years of your existence from today itself.
You should prepare a roadmap for that historic occasion from today itself to scale new heights for the institution and its character.
And decide what you will do for the country, for the future of millions and millions of aspiring youths.
Can’t you help in providing a transparent and corruption free system for the country?
What will you say?
Will you look at the number of the people that you saved from paying the taxes?
Or will you look at the number of people that were encouraged by you to lead honest lives by paying taxes?
You will have to decide on this.
You set a target for yourself that how many people you will bring in the mainstream by honestly paying the taxes.
Who can be a better judge than you yourself to set a target for this task?
Please also think how you can expand the role of technology in your profession.
I fail to understand why you lag behind.
And out of those big eight, four big firms will belong to the people who are sitting here before me.
Friends this is our dream.
And it’s not difficult given the reputation and professionalism of our firms.
My friends you people must be respected world over in the field of chartered accountancy.
In the end, I’d like to remind you of an advice by the most revered economist – Chanakya.
He said: “Kalati Kramat Kal Avam Falam Pivati”, it means the time itself undermines the value of the success of something if it was not done in the right time.
Therefore don’t let your time go in vain.
Arun Ji was talking to you just a while ago; he was saying that India never had this kind of opportunity before.
I’ve come to invite you to associate yourself with the mainstream of India’s development.
Please don’t lose sight of the fact this profession has the capacity to protect, to sustain the entire economy.
Many thanks my friends, many thanks.

Working on the aspirational districts will improve India’s standing in the HDI.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today, interacted with the beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana and store owners of Jan Aushadi Kendras, through video conference.

The project is a visible symbol of India’s contribution to strengthening and rebuilding democracy in Afghanistan.
Due to the emphasis on promoting energy efficiency and rationalization of gas pricing mechanism, highest ever urea production in the period so far has been achieved this year.
It is expected that there will be an additional production of 17 lakh MT of urea this year as compared to last year.
Moreover, to prevent diversion to non-agricultural use and to enhance productivity, 100% of urea is now neem coated.
Further, policy on promotion of City Compost is a major initiative which aims at the twin objectives of making cities cleaner and utilizing the city garbage as compost for improving soil health.
Under this policy, for the first time market development assistance of Rs.1500 per MT will be provided to scale up production and consumption of the product.
Because of the simple production technique, it is one of the cheapest chemical fertilizer available.
It is more suited for crops like oil-seeds, pulses, horticulture, vegetables, sugarcane, etc.
From 01.10.2009, it was made mandatory for the SSP units to utilize minimum 50% of their recognized production capacity or to produce 40000 MT, whichever is less, per year to become eligible for subsidy.
There was some capacity addition in the beginning, but for the last four years the production and consumption of SSP in the country has remained more or less stagnant.
Due to this minimum capacity utilization criteria, large number of small SSP units which failed to reach this level were not able to avail of subsidy, in spite of having passed the subsidy benefit to the farmer in the form of lower MRP.
Many units because of this apprehension, did not commence production.
Non eligibility to receive subsidy created financial problems including working capital issues for the SSP units, which also resulted in loss of capacity.
This new policy will help revive smaller SSP units and encourage new SSP units to come up in the country to further boost indigenous production of SSP.
It would also provide freedom to the SSP manufacturers to plan their production as per the market dynamics.
SSP is also considered as a substitute to DAP, which is largely import based.
Growth of SSP industry will not only increase domestic production of phosphatic fertilizers in the country but also its consumption and partly act as a substitute for more costly DAP.
This would also encourage the evolution of a robust mixed fertilizer market with diversified micro-nutrients to promote balanced fertilization of the soil.
The Union Cabinet in its meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and Israel on National Campaign for Water Conservation in India.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to transfer of 14.86 hectares of land from Farakka Barrage Project under the Ministry of Water Resources to Inland Waterways Authority of India under the Ministry of Shipping for construction of a new navigational lock parallel to the existing navigational lock at Farakka.
The details are as follows:-
(i). Transfer of 14.86 hectares of land from Farakka Barrage Project (FBP), Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR) to Ministry of Shipping for construction of the new navigational lock at Farakka.
(ii). The cost of the land is Rs.2,35,80,160/- (Rupees two crore, thirty five lakh, eighty thousand, one hundred sixty only) approximately.
Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) will bear this cost.
(iii). Construction of the navigational lock is a subproject of Jal Marg Vikas Project.
The new lock will ensure smooth and seamless movement of vessels on NW-1.
The advantage of construction of new navigation lock at Farakka are given below:-
a) The existing lock is unable to handle the number of vessels currently passing through it efficiently and effectively.
At present, considerable time is taken for the vessels to pass the existing navigational lock.
b) The process of modernization/up-gradation/repair of the existing navigational lock is time consuming and will put it out of operation during the period of repair.
Construction of the new navigational lock therefore is an inescapable option for uninterrupted movement of vessels.
c) IWAI, a statutory body under the Ministry of Shipping, is the nodal authority responsible for regulation and development of inland waterways for the purposes of shipping and navigation.
It is, therefore, within its mandate to build, maintain, operate and manage the navigational locks.
The works shall be planned/executed in such a manner that the existing arrangements about sharing of Ganga water at Farakka, as per Ganga Water Treaty-1996 between India and Bangladesh, are not affected.
Ministry of Shipping would work out detailed modalities for construction of new navigational lock as well as modernization of the existing navigational lock at Farakka in consultation with Mo WR, RD & GR/FBP in a phased manner to ensure seamless navigation on NW-1.
Background:-
(i). IWAI is implementing Jal Marg Vikas Project for capacity augmentation of navigation on National Waterway – 1 on Allahabad – Haldia stretch of Ganga – Bhagarathi Hooghly River System with technical and investment support of the World Bank.
(ii). A navigational Lock is already in operation at Farakka under the control of Farakka Barrage Project (FBP) since 1987.
This lock needs modernization.
(iii). The first Scooping Mission of World Bank (August 2014) had recommended maintenance and up-gradation works at the existing navigational lock, along with construction of a new lock.
The objectives of Jal Marg Vikas Project can be fully achieved if the navigation upstream of the Farakka navigational lock is synchronized to match that downstream of the navigational lock.
The policy advocates:-
Accordingly, the new National Digital Communications Policy – 2018 has been formulated, in place of the existing National Telecom Policy-2012, to cater to the modern needs of the digital communications sector of India.
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Shri O. Panneerselvam, called on the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.

How to live in peace and harmony and secure our lives?
He said that it is only natural that the search for answers be led by the humanity’s longest traditions of thought, rooted in various religions, civilizations, and multiple streams of spirituality.
The Prime Minister said that he is a “product of the ancient Indian tradition that firmly believes in dialogue on difficult issues.”
He said that the ancient Indian concept of “Tarka Shastra” is founded on dialogue and debate as the model for exchange of views and avoidance of conflict.
Giving illustrations from Indian mythology such as Lord Rama, Lord Krishna, Lord Buddha and Bhakta Prahlada, the Prime Minister said that the purpose of each of their actions was to uphold Dharma, which has sustained Indians from ancient to modern times.
The Prime Minister said “Samvad” or “dialogue” is the only way to cut through deep rooted religious stereotypes and prejudices that divide communities across the world and sow seeds of conflict between nations and societies.
Environmental laws and regulations, while essential in any modern society, afford only an inferior protection to nature, he added, calling for “harmonious environmental consciousness.”

Today, here in this wonderful setting, we see the power of the relationship between India and Singapore.
But, Singapore’s success also lies in the harmony of its multi-cultural society, in the celebration of its diversity, which under-lies a distinct and unique Singaporean identity.
And, in this wonderful mosaic, there is an ancient thread, beautiful and colourful, that binds India and Singapore.
The course of India’s centuries-old route to South East Asia also ran through Singapore.
The human link is deep and enduring.
It lives in the Singaporean Indians.
And, this evening has been lit-up with your presence, your energy, your talent and your achievements.
Whether you are here through the chance of history or the opportunities of globalisation; Whether your ancestors came here generations ago, or you came here in this century; Each of you has become part of Singapore’s unique fabric, and its progress.
In turn, Singapore has embraced you, your merit and your hard work.
Here in Singapore, you represent the diversity of India.
If you want to see all festivals of India in one city, or celebrate them for weeks, Singapore is the place to visit.
That might also be true now for Indian food!
I still remember the dinner Prime Minister Lee hosted for me in Little India.
Tamil is an official language here.
But, it is a testimony to Singapore’s spirit that school children can also learn five other Indian languages.
The city throbs with the finest of Indian culture.

It brings you memories of your youth and enables children to connect to kho kho and kabaddi.
And, in 2017, International Day of Yoga was held at 70 centres in this city.

In their service to society, without distinction between people, reflect the values that bind India and Singapore.
In their journey through Singapore and the region, the greatest of Indian thinkers Swami Vivekananda and poet Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore found a common chord that connects India to the East.
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s call to march for India’s freedom from the soil of Singapore -दिल्ली चलो- is an enduring flame in the heart of every Indian.

The moment which underlines even today the timeless and universal values of Mahatma Gandhi.
on the foundations of this extraordinary heritage, the wealth of our human links and the strength of our shared values, India and Singapore are building a partnership of our age.
It is a relationship that truly meets the test of strategic partnership.
When India opened up to the world and turned to the East, Singapore became a partner and a bridge between India and ASEAN.
Political relations between India and Singapore are among the warmest and closest.
There are no contests or claims, or doubts.
It is a natural partnership from a shared vision.
Our defence relations are among the strongest, for both.
My Armed Forces speak with great respect and admiration for Singapore’s Armed Forces.
India’s longest continuous naval exercise is with Singapore.
They are marking their Silver Jubilee now.
We are proud to host Singapore’s Army and Air Force for training in India.
I, too, am looking forward to visiting a Singapore Navy Ship and an Indian Naval Ship at the Changi Naval Base day after tomorrow.
In international forums, we speak in one voice in the cause of a rules-based order, sovereign equality of all nations, and free and open pathways of commerce and engagement.
Economics is the heart-beat of the relationship.
It is a partnership at the front-line of India’s global engagement.
Singapore is both a leading investment source and destination for India.
Singapore was the first country with which we signed a Comprehnsive Economic Cooperation Agreement.
Nearly 250 flights in each direction every week connect Singapore to 16 Indian cities.
And, that is set to grow.
India is the third largest source of tourists in Singapore and its fastest growing.
Our IT companies are helping Singapore stay smart and competitive.
So, India and Singapore are contributing to each other’s prosperity.
And, now we are building new partnerships for the digital world.
Prime Minister Lee and I just made a tour of an outstanding exhibition of technology, innovation and enterprise.
These are the bright youth of India and Singapore.
Many of them are brilliant talent from India that have made Singapore home.
They will be the bridge of innovation and enterprise between India, Singapore and ASEAN.
A short while ago, we saw the international launch of RuPay, BHIM and UPI.
It is natural for these to be launched in Singapore!
Together, we will work for using the power of mobile and digital technology for governance and inclusion.
Together, we can build a great economic partnership of the new age.
As Singapore shapes a new future for itself, India emerges as the new global frontier of opportunities.
Even in a year of deep structural reforms like the introduction of Goods and Services Tax, we remain the fastest growing major economy of the world.
And we intend to stay that-way.
Our economy has become more stable.
Fiscal deficit is down.
Inflation rate is down.
Current account deficit is comfortable.
The currency is stable.
And, the foreign exchange reserves are at a record high.
In India, the present is changing rapidly.
A ‘New India’ is taking shape.
And, there are many reasons for it.
One, Economic reforms are taking place at a speed and a scale not known so far.
Over 10,000 measures by Central and state governments in the last two years have helped us move up 42 places in the Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Over 1,400 out-dated laws have been repealed.
India is among the most open economies in the world.
Foreign investors can go into almost all sectors, often with up to 100% equity.
Indeed, more than 90% of investments in India are through this route.
Goods and Services Tax is the biggest tax reform since independence It has unified the nation into a single market and increased the tax base.
And, it has created new economic opportunities.
Our personal income tax base has also expanded by nearly 20 million.
Three, our infrastructure sector is expanding at record speed.
Pace of rail track addition has doubled.
Metro rails in several cities, seven High Speed Rail Projects, dedicated freight corridors, and modernisation of 400 railway stations will transform the rail sector.
Other projects include 10 green field airports; five new major ports; 111 rivers designated as National Water-ways; and over 30 logistics parks.
We added over 80 thousand mega-watts of power in just three years.
And, in renewable energy, we have become the sixth largest producer in the world.
That is our commitment to a green and sustainable future.
Quite simply, the biggest infrastructure story of the world is unfolding in India.
Four, our manufacturing sector is rebounding.
There has been a sharp rise in FDI in the past three years – from 36 billion U.S.dollars in 2013-14 to 60 billion U.S.dollars in 2016-17.
There is also special focus on the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Sector.
We have launched sector-specific modernisation and productivity programmes, reduced corporate tax rate, and made tax benefits more attractive and easier.
The Indian Startup sector is flourishing, and is now the third largest in the world.
My favourite scheme is, of course, the मुद्रा scheme that offers micro credit to the poor and the excluded.
In the course of the past three years, we have opened 316 million bank accounts for those who never had a bank account.
Now, 99% of Indian house-holds have a bank account.
Now here in the world has banking expansion taken place on such a scale and at such speed.
Six, a digital revolution is sweeping through India.
Through a biometric identity for everyone, a mobile phone in almost every pocket, and a bank account in everyone’s reach, every Indian’s life is getting transformed.
And, it is also transforming everything else in India: governance, public service, delivery of benefits to the poor, putting banking and pension within the reach of the poorest.
For example, digital transactions are growing rapidly.
In January, all digital transactions were valued at 2 trillion U.S. dollars.
These will offer many digital services and create thousands of rural jobs.
One of the exhibitors today is from one of these labs.
Seven, India will experience the largest wave of urbanisation in the world over the next two decades.
It is a challenge, but also a huge responsibility and opportunity.
We are working to transform 100 cities into Smart Cities, and 115 aspirational districts into new centres of progress.
Mass transit, waste management, pollution control, sustainable habitat and affordable housing are programmes of great priority for us.
Eight, we are investing in skills and raising the standards of higher education to give a life of dignity and opportunity for our 800 million youth.
With learning from Singapore, we are setting up advanced Institutes of Skill Development.
And, in this fiscal year, we have launched a 15 billion U.S. dollar programme, to further strengthen our higher education system.
Nine, Agriculture sector is receiving a level of priority that it has not since the Green Revolution decades ago.
We aim to double the income of farmers by 2022, when Independent India will be 75 and a ‘New India’ will be born.
For this, we are using technology, remote sensing, internet, digital financial system, soft credit, insurance, soil health improvement, irrigation, pricing and connectivity.
Ten, we want every citizen to enjoy what I call ‘Ease of Living’ by 2022.
It means, for example, 50 million new houses so that there is roof over every head in 2022.
Last month, we reached a milestone.
Each one of our 600 thousand villages are now connected to a power grid.
We are also working to provide electric connection to every household.
We have launched this year AYUSHMAN Bharat, the National Health Insurance Scheme.
It will cover 100 million families or 500 million Indians with annual coverage of 8000 U.S. dollars.
This is simply the largest healthcare scheme in the world.
Quality of life is also linked to clean and sustainable development.
That is one of our principal goals.
It is rooted in our heritage and our commitment to the planet’s future.
And, it informs every aspect of public policy and economic choices in India now.
It includes our mission of Clean India, clean rivers, clean air and clean cities.
And, all these changes are taking place because of one and only one reason: our people.
A nation of 1.25 billion people, with 65% under the age of 35 years, is on the move, eager for change, and confident about achieving a New India.
That is also driving change in governance and politics.
There is complete clarity and confidence about the pace and direction of economic reforms in India.
We will make it easier and smoother to do business in India.
We will work for an open, stable and fair international trade regime.
And, our engagement to our East will be among the strongest, and economics will remain an integral part of our Act East Policy.
We want to see a comprehnsive fair, balanced agreement that lifts up all nations on the tide of trade and investment.
We have just completed the review of India-Singapore Comprehnsive Economic Cooperation Agreement and we will work to further upgrade it.
We will work with all, most of all with ASEAN, to reach an early conclusion to Regional Comprehnsive Economic Partnership.
As India’s engagement with the region grows, Singapore will remain a gateway to ASEAN and the broader East.
This year, Sinagapore’s Chairmanship of ASEAN will take India’s relations with ASEAN further and farther ahead.
In conclusion For Singapore, there is no better opportunity than India.
Few countries have so much in common and so much in potential as India and Singapore.
We mirror each other in our societies and we wish the same future for our region.
We pursue a world based on rule of law, and connected by open seas and a stable trade regime.
Above all, we have the world’s most talented, dynamic, professional and committed Indian diaspora, proud to be Singaporeans, proud of their Indian heritage, ready to be the bridge between India and Singapore.
The future is a world of unlimited opportunities.
It belongs to us.
It is up to us to be ambitious and bold to seize it.
This evening tells us that we are on the right path.
The two lions shall step into the future together.

The Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2018
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given approval to introduce the banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2018 in Parliament.
The bill is aimed at tackling the menace of illicit deposit taking activities in the country.
Companies/ institutions running such schemes exploit existing regulatory gaps and lack of strict administrative measures to dupe poor and gullible people of their hard-earned savings.
The Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2018 will provide a comprehensive legislation to deal with the menace of illicit deposit schemes in the country through,
1. complete prohibition of unregulated deposit taking activity;
2. deterrent punishment for promoting or operating an unregulated deposit taking scheme;
3. stringent punishment for fraudulent default in repayment to depositors;
4. designation of a Competent Authority by the State Government to ensure repayment of deposits in the event of default by a deposit taking establishment;
5. powers and functions of the competent authority including the power to attach assets of a defaulting establishment;
6. designation of Courts to oversee repayment of depositors and to try offences under the Act; and
7. listing of Regulated Deposit Schemes in the Bill, with a clause enabling the Central Government to expand or prune the list.
The salient features of the Bill are as follows:
• The Bill contains a substantive banning clause which bans Deposit Takers from promoting, operating, issuing advertisements or accepting deposits in any Unregulated Deposit Scheme.
• The Bill provides for severe punishment and heavy pecuniary fines to act as deterrent.
• The Bill has adequate provisions for disgorgement or repayment of deposits in cases where such schemes nonetheless manage to raise deposits illegally.
• The Bill provides for attachment of properties/ assets by the Competent Authority, and subsequent realization of assets for repayment to depositors.
• Clear-cut time lines have been provided for attachment of property and restitution to depositors.
• The Bill enables creation of an online central database, for collection and sharing of information on deposit taking activities in the country.
• The Bill defines “Deposit Taker” and “Deposit” comprehensively.
The Finance Minister in the Budget Speech 2016-17 had announced that a comprehensive central legislation wouldbe brought in to deal with the menace of illicit deposit taking schemes, as in the recent past, there have been rising instances of people in various parts of the country beingdefrauded by illicit deposit taking schemes.

In order to facilitate orderly growth of the Chit Funds sector and remove bottlenecks being faced by the Chit Funds industry, thereby enabling greater financial access of people to other financial products, the following amendments to the Chit Funds Act, 1982 have been proposed:
• While retaining the requirement of a minimum of two subscribers for the conduct of the draw of the Chit and for the preparation of the minutes of the proceedings, the Chit Funds (Amendment) Bill, 2018 proposes to allow the two minimum required subscribers to join through video conferencing duly recorded by the foreman, as physical presence of the subscribers towards the final stages of a Chit may not be forthcoming easily.
The foreman shall have the minutes of the proceedings signed by such subscribers within a period of two days following the proceedings;
• Allowing the foreman a right to lien for the dues from subscribers, so that set-off is allowed by the Chit company for subscribers who have already drawn funds, so as to discourage default by them; and

Paradigm shifts are taking place in the Sector – bringing to fore complex issues of regulation, enforcement and security – requiring higher levels of technical supervision in the Department of telecommunications.
Hence, a cadre structure of ITS officers has been proposed, which is considered essential for discharge of the role & obligations of the Department of Telecommunications.
Mr. Joey Concepcion
Chairman, ASEAN Business Advisory Council;
Ladies and Gentlemen!
At the onset, I apologise for the delay.
In business, like in politics, both time and timing are very important.
But sometimes despite our best efforts we cannot help it.
I am delighted to be here in Manila, on my very first visit to the Philippines.
There is a lot that India and the Philippines share in common:
• We have large, young and aspiring populations that are innovative and enterprising.
• The Philippines is a services power house just as India is.
And, just as in India, here in Philippines also, the government wants to see change, bring about inclusive growth, Develop infrastructure, and fight corruption.
No wonder so many of our top IT companies have invested here.
They are creating thousands of jobs and promoting the Philippines services sector world-wide.
This morning we witnessed a brilliant performance of the dance drama ‘Rama Hari’ based on the Ramayana at the Opening Ceremony of the ASEAN Summit.
These are not only historical bonds.
This is a living shared heritage.
We wish to bring our economic and business relations up to the same level.
The task of transforming India is proceeding on an unprcedented scale.
We are working day and night to ensure Good Governance which includes easy, effective and transparent Governance.
To give you an example: we have started open auction for natural resources including telecom spectrum, coal mines and other minerals and even private radio channels.
This has together contributed about 75 billion US dollars in revenue.
Using technology, we are enhancing responsibility and reducing discretion and corruption.
We are using our Unique ID system in financial transactions and taxation for this purpose and the results are already visible.
These steps, coupled with demonetization of high value notes has resulted in formalizing a large part of our economy.
Digital transactions have increased by 34 per cent in one year, as we march towards a less-cash economy.
An online citizen engagement platform, MyGov has harnessed ideas, suggestions and inputs on policies and programmes from 2 million pro-active citizens.
In keeping with our emphasis on minimum government and maximum governance, 1200 out-dated laws have been repealed in three years.
We have simplified industrial licensing, and introduced online application process for environmental and forest clearances.
All these have made opening a new business very easy.
The results are obvious .
India has climbed 30 places in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index this year.
It is the biggest jump by any country this year and a recognition of India’s long term reform trajectory.
Most of the sectors of our economy are now open for FDI.
More than 90 per cent FDI sectors are on automatic approval route.India has emerged as a front-runner in attracting foreign direct investment.
Compared to last three years, we have received 67 per cent more FDI in this year.
This is no small achievement given the vastness and diversity of our country and the federal nature of our polity.
At the same time, we strongly believe that this is not enough.
Friends, A very large part of India’s population had no access to banking services.
This deprived them of the opportunities for savings as well as access to institutional credit.
With the Jan Dhan Yojana, within a matter of months, the lives of millions of Indians were transformed.
Now, subsidies meant for the poor get directly deposited into their accounts in the form of direct benefit transfers, eliminating leakages and possibility of any discrimination.
Subsidies worth nearly 10 billion US dollars are being directly transferred to the bank accounts of the intended beneficiaries.
We want to make India a global manufacturing hub.
At the same time, we want our youth to be job creators; not just job seekers.
For the first time in India, collateral-free loans have been dis-bursed to more than 90 million small entrepreneurs under the Mudra scheme.
Very near to the population of Philippines.
This is a recognition of the contribution of small entrepreneurs in the economy and to empower a person who has a work-able business idea but no collateral.
I see the importance being given to entrepreneur- -ship in the Philippines and in ASEAN region.
The ASEAN Mentor-ship for Entrepreneurs launched at this Summit is a commendable initiative that addresses another felt need of entrepreneurs.
Indeed, for the near future, South and South East Asia will be the growth engine of the world.
Hence, building connectivity with ASEAN is a key objective for India.
Work is already on in the construction of the tri-lateral highway through Myanmar and Thailand to connect to other countries in South East Asia.
While some of you are already deeply involved in India, others are just discovering the possibilities that remain to be tapped.
To co-incide with the ASEAN –India Comme–morative Summit of ASEAN leaders in January next year, we are also organising the ASEAN-India Business and Investment Meet and Expo.
India wishes to participate in your growth story and we invite all of ASEAN to participate in ours.

His Excellency Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, Business Leaders of India and Israel,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu and members of the Israeli Delegation on behalf of all my countrymen.
It is an added pleasure to be with the CEOs of both countries.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have just completed a fruitful interaction with Indian and Israeli business leaders through the bilateral CEOs Forum.
I have high hopes from this interaction and partnership of CEOs, which started last year.
I have always had a deep regard for Israel and its people.
I visited Israel in 2006 as Chief Minister of Gujarat.
Again last year in July, I visited Israel, the first such visit from India.
It was a very special visit.
I experienced at close quarters the remarkable spirit of innovation, enterprise and perseverance that drives Israel.
There is new energy and purpose that has in-vigorated our ties over the last few years.
It will help take our cooperation to greater heights.
The role of business and industry is crucial in the transformation of our ties.
It is your combined efforts that will add real value to our interaction and produce concrete successes.
Given the scale of the Indian economy and the relevance of cutting-edge Israeli technologies for us, even sky is not the limit for what we may achieve together!
Equally exciting is the pick up in science and technology exchanges through joint R&D projects such as in areas like “Data Analytics” and “Cyber Space security”.
I am happy to note that the India-Israel Innovation and Technology Conclave is going to be held in India in July 2018.
I hope this Conclave will spur co–development of new technologies.
The credit for this goes to the Israeli entrepreneurs.
You have made Israel a strong, stable and innovative economy.
You have made a country of 8 million people, shine as a global power-house of technology.
Whether it is Water Tech; or Agri-Tech; whether it is food production, its processing or conservation; Israel has been a shining example with new breakthru and advances.
Whether it is physical or virtual security; whether it is on land, water or space; your technology has won admiration.
In fact, hailing from a water deficient state in India, I have particularly admired Israel’s water efficiency.
In India, we have been taking steady steps over three years at both macro as well as micro-level, to make a difference.
Our motto is: Reform, Perform and Transform.
The results are two-fold.
On the one hand, our procedures, processes and systems are getting aligned with the best in the world.
Secondly, we are able to maintain the pace of faster growth.
In spite of deep structural reforms, we are among the fastest growing major economies.
FDI inflows are at an all-time high, with 40% rise.
Tremendous work is being done to skill and employ the youth.
This is our greatest opportunity as well as challenge.
For this purpose, we have started the Start-up India campaign.
There is vast potential for India-Israel partnership in this area.
There would be many ideas and technologies that can be useful for or can be commercially scaled up in India.
Today, we have emerged as one of the largest manufacturing nations.
But we are not done yet.
We are positioning India as a global manufacturing hub leveraging the energy of our youth.
The ‘Make in India’ initiative is designed to help achieve this.
Through these initiatives, combined with the new eco-system of a formal economy and a unified tax regime, we are trying to create a NEW INDIA.
We are particularly keen to develop India into a knowledge-based, skill-supported and technology-driven society.
A grand beginning has already been made through Digital India and Skill India.
To enable this transformation, in the last few years, my Government has undertaken substantial reforms.
We have resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies.
To enable entry of capital and technology, most of the sectors including defence, have been opened for FDI.
We are now among the most open economies.
Just a few days ago, we have allowed 100% automatic route FDI in single brand retail and construction development.
We also opened up our national carrier, Air India, to foreign investors.
Every day we are making it easier to do business in India.
In taxation, we have carried out a number of historic reforms.
The path breaking GST reform has been introduced successfully and smoothly.
It is by far the biggest business and economic reform India has ever done.
Several Israeli companies have joined hands with Indian companies for Making in India.
Many others, especially those with advanced water technologies and agri techniques, defence and security systems, and pharma knowledge have a foot-hold in India.
Similarly, Indian companies have significant presence in several sectors in Israel like IT, Irrigation and Pharma.
Diamond remains a strong link in our trade.
There are more business joint ventures today than before.
However, this is just the beginning.
Our trade with Israel has grown to more than 5 billion dollars.
But this is still well below the real potential.
We must attain the full potential of our ties.
This is not only a diplomatic imperative but also an economic one.
I welcome your suggestions on how to unlock our combined potential.
The spirit of innovation, adaptation and problem solving is inherent in both countries.
Just to give you an example:
Imagine the environmental and economic gains if we can collaborate to save wastage and if we can add value in our fruits, vegetables and horticulture!
Similar is the case with water.
We have situations of plenty as well as scarcity of water.
We have situations of food being thrown away even as there are many who go hungry.
India’s development agenda is huge.
It presents a vast economic opportunity for Israeli companies.
I invite more and more Israeli people, businesses and companies to come and work in India.
Along with the Government and people, the business community of India too is keen to join hands.
I wish your companies and ventures all success.
I assure you of my support and that of my Government wherever it is required.
And I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his continuous support in fast-tracking India-Israel trade and economic collaboration.
I am confident many successes lie ahead for our partnership.

The fourth pillar is activity (Sakreeyta).

He said digital technology is being used to improve transparency and quality of citizen services.
Similarly, projects are being tracked in real-time.

He said the PRAGATI meetings have helped speed up projects worth over 9 lakh crore rupees.
The Prime Minister gave the example of the closing down of the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals.
He said that public procurement is now being done through the Government e Market, or GeM platform.
This is helping end corruption and bring transparency in government procurement, he added.
He also spoke of minimizing human interface in government-people interactions.
The Prime Minister said that as transparency in the system increases, there is more trust in the government.
He said that citizens should be aware both about their rights and their duties.
He said that the CIC can also explain to people, the importance of “Acting Right.”
He said that in the quest for rights, it is important not to forget duties.
He said that keeping in mind the present conditions and future challenges, every responsible institution should balance its rights with its duties.

Heartiest welcome to Prime Minister Mark and his delegation in India.
And it clearly shows how much dynamism is there in our trade and investment relationship.
So many possibilities are there.
Prime Minister Rutte first came to India in 2015.
There are very few such countries, with whom we have this kind of momentum of high level visits in our relationships.
And for this momentum and for giving personal priority to the relations with India, I congratulate my friend Mark from the bottom of my heart.
Today, both of us reviewed the progress in our bilateral relations.
And shared our own assessments of regional and global developments.
And we also met the prominent CEOs of both the countries.
Last year when I went to Netherlands, I had urged my friend Mark to think positively on becoming a member of the International Solar Alliance.
The expertise, the technology and the experience which Netherlands has in the field of solar power, whole world should benefit from it.
And I am happy that today Netherlands has become a member of the International Solar Alliance.
I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Rutte for this decision.
From UN Security Council to Multilateral Export Control Regimes, India and Netherlands have had very good and close cooperation and coordination.
And now International Solar Alliance will be a new dimension of our strong cooperation in international forums.
India is not new to Dutch companies.
Hundreds of Dutch companies have been working in India for many years.
Similarly, Netherlands is also a very attractive destination for investment by Indian companies.
And therefore, meeting with the CEOs of both the countries is very useful.
I am happy that the business community in Netherlands is enthusiastic about opportunities being created in India.
I have also assured them of my strong commitment towards economic reforms in India.
Areas related to agriculture and food processing are particularly important for India.
Netherlands has expertise in these areas.
Last year Netherlands participated as the Focus Country in World Food India Summit.
And I believe that in its next edition in 2019, participation of the Netherlands will be even more.
I am happy that the first Indo-Dutch Center of Excellence for vegetables has started in Baramati.
We are working together on other similar types of centers as well.
Similarly, our cooperation in urban development is also very dynamic.
Waste Water Management projects in Vadodara and Delhi are making good progress.
Providing special attention to the issues of Indian society living abroad has been a major priority of my government’s foreign policy.

Achievement
_Allocation Release
At present, oil palm development programme is being promoted in individual farmer’s field.
There is no scope to provide assistance directly to private entrepreneurs/Cooperative bodies/Joint ventures for large scale plantation.
Therefore, there is a need for relaxation of restrictions under NMOOP to attract corporate bodies towards oil palm and derive maximum benefit of 100% FDI.
A combination of individual farming, contract farming and captive plantation (by relaxing land ceiling norms) can only boost oil palm cultivation in the country.
The norms of assistance for various interventions were decided on the basis of prevailing prices at the time of formulation of the NMOOP programme.
Besides, in North Eastern States, which have good potential for oil palm needs additional investment in land preparation being hilly terrain.
Edible Oil is an important component of household food basket.

Hon’ble Minister of International Relations and Cooperation,
Hon’ble Minister of Trade and Industry,
Captains of South African and Indian Industry,
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I am happy to be with you today.
India-South Africa relations are built on a strong foundation of history.
• We were directed together by destiny;
• We are driven together by dreams.
Our history had many common chapters.
With struggle and sacrifice, we changed the course of history.
Now, it is the time to work for economic freedom.
Thus, our relations rest upon our common desire to fulfil the aspirations of our people.
• We have been friends in adversities ;
• Now we should franchise in opportunities
With the blessings of our great leaders, both the countries have marched on the path of development.
Both South Africa and India are important players in the BRICS economies.
Our people at home and the world at large are looking at us with great expectations.
We can join handsto fulfil these twin expectations.
It is heartening that we have had very active and fruitful engagement on all possible fronts.
However, President Zuma and I have met several times in last two years.
South Africa is India’s key trade and investment partner.
In the last ten years, bilateral trade has grown almost 380%.
The story of investments also continues to be bright.
There is continuous flow of investments both ways.
This is because both countries are strengthening their economic fundamentals.
Therefore, we must look at ways to diversify our trade basket, to complement our needs and to serve the people.
Many leading Indian companies have a foot-print here.
They are engaged in a wide range of activities.
Many Indian CEOs are here with us.
My advice to them is to see that their business results into socio–economic transformation of this great country.
I have been advocating three Ps for India.
The spirit of African humanism , UBUNTU , should reflect in your business ethos.
We have always believed in nurturing and nourishing not in exploiting.
Encouraging fact is that our business engagement is not one way.
South African companies are also active in India.
Many of them have presence on ground.
We have learnt from your knowledge and benefited from your innovative products.
South African business excellence and Indian capacities must leverage each other; for growth and development in our two countries.
In last two years we have worked very hard on all fronts to set the economy right.
We have got very encouraging results of our sincerity and hard work.
Today, India is a bright star in the global economy.
We are being seen as the engine of global growth.
India has become the fastest growing large economy in the world.
At a time of global slowdown, we have registered 7.6% growth in GDP.
World Bank, IMF and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days.
Not only that, in 2014-15, India contributed 12.5% of global growth.
Its contribution to global growth is 68% higher than its share of the world economy.
The FDI in this year has been the highest ever.
The ratings agency Moody’s has said that FDI inflows were all-time high in 2016, highlighting the success of our ‘Make in India’ initiative.
Both within and outside the country, it has captured the imagination of people, institutions, industries, businesses, media and the political leadership.
As part of the Make in India exercise, we have given emphasis on Ease of Doing Business.
We have taken decisive steps to ease the licensing processes and rationalize the provisions relating to clearances, returns, and inspections.
If I talk of some other indicators:
• India has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several global agencies and institutions.
• We have jumped 12 ranks in the latest global ranking by the World Bank on ease of doing business.
• India has also improved its UNCTAD ranking of investment attractiveness.
• Against 15th so far, now we are at 9th place.
• India has also jumped 16 places on the World Economic Forum’s global competitive index.
Due to positive impact of our policies and practices, our confidence has gone up.
This also gives us motivation to further simplify our processes to become an easier place to do business.
An innovative Start-up India programme has also been launched to incubate ideas and develop them into enterprises.
All this is having a good impact on expansion of job market and rise in purchasing power of the people.
This finally leads to India becoming a place with better quality of life and higher living standards.
We have ensured that our growth is inclusive and embraces both rural and urban communities.
We are taking a leap towards next generation infrastructure in both core areas and social sectors.
Socio-economic challenges of both our countries are more or less same.
My advice is that the wheels of development should not be re-invented.
Our two countries are very uniquely positioned to complement each other.
• Nature has been kind on both of us.
We have immense natural resources.
The need is to properly harness them and to use them sustainably for welfare of the common man.
We can learn a lot from each other in this.
• We particularly want to engage with your world class mining companies.
Some of them are already active in India.
At the same time, we need energy resources.
• With the help of a number of countries, we have formed the International Solar Alliance.
I hope that we will enrich and take advantage of this forum.
• Our two countries have the unique benefit of opposite seasons
When it is summer or mango season in India, it is winter here, and vice versa.
We can leverage this geographic advantage to market each other’s fruits, vegetables and other perishables
• India with its huge domestic market offers massive opportunities for your food processing industry.
Our collaboration in this sector will bring value for our farmers and our villages.
• We in India are working on very ambitious plans of infrastructure.
The task which is pending from the days of independence has to be completed fast now.
Together, we can do a lot to fill these gaps.
• India is best suited to help you in technology and skills.
Efforts are already underway in these areas.
At the India Africa Forum Summit held in New Delhi last year, we under-took to educate and train 50,000 Africans in India over the next five years.
We can work together in a number of areas.
• From Defence to Dairy;
• From Hardware to Software;
• From Medicines to Medical Tourism;
• From Soft Skills to Science and Technology.
There are opportunities for us.
India today is among the most open economies.
We have liberalised our FDI regime in most of the areas and in all possible ways.
We have rationalised our norms and made it simple for businesses to establish and grow.
To conclude, I would like to say that we have added institutional depth to our partnership.
Our BRICS business engagement and CEOs Forum have helped to expand and enrich our partnership.
Today, we have successfully held the 3rd Meeting of the India-South Africa CEOs Forum.
We are thankful to the South African government for introducing 10 year BRICS (ब्रिक्स) visa for regular business travellers.
The Indian Industry is quite encouraged by the move.
In February this year, we launched our e-Visa programme for South Africa.
This is valid for short term tourist and business travellers.
You can now get your visa for India sitting at home in your email, and that too free of cost!
• Let us join hands once more;
• Let us commit ourselves together once again;
• This is necessary to fight the enemy of poverty;
• This is perhaps much more challenging;
• But we have to succeed;
• And this only can be our real tribute to our great leaders.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Rani Lakshmibai on her Jayanti.
‘Abhinandan’ seeks to portray the assimilation of India’s performing arts traditions by Russian artistes.
Abhinandan will commence with a Shloka recital and a creative rendering of Vande Mataram by Russian Brahmakumaris, followed by continuing sequence of brief Kuchipudi, Kathak and Dandiya Raas.
The programme will conclude with all artistes coming on stage for a musical enactment of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s poem “Geet Naya Gata Hoon” rendered by Lata Mangeshkar.
‘Abhinandan’ will contain performances by 52 artistes.
The significance of this performance is that it falls on the eve of Atal ji’s birthday.
‘Abhivyakti’ is an attempt to articulate and convey an authentic image of Indian traditions, history and culture by Russian artistes and enthusiasts, which resonates in the hearts, and minds of all Indians and well-wishers of India in foreign countries.
It is a reflection of the feeling of brotherhood and amity that exists between the people of India and Russia.
‘Abhivyakti’ is dedicated to the expression of goodwill, joy, and enthusiasm aptly represented by our philosophy of ‘Vasudheva Kutumbakam’ that characterizes our interaction with the rest of the world.
‘Abhivyakti’ would contain performances by 100 artistes and will consist majorly of Namaskaram, Charishnu, Bharatnatyam, Rudra, Pandattam, Khoria, Lavni, Kalina Taal performances.
Given the geographical and cultural closeness between the two countries, there are many common challenges like countering terrorism that needs joint action.
Hence, there is a need for better coordination and cooperation among the armed forces.
The joint training and exercises will help to bring symmetry in capacities of the armed forces and contribute to countering and managing common threats and challenges much better.
Director General, Indo Tibetan Border Police Force, Sh.
R K Pachnanda, called on Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today, and presented a cheque of Rs. 8.5 crore towards the Prime Minister`s National Relief Fund.
The amount was raised through the contribution from ITBP personnel.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted everyone, on the auspicious occasion of Gurupurab.
Gurupurab wishes to everyone.
The inspiring teachings of the venerable Guru Nanak guide us in creating a prosperous and harmonious society”, the Prime Minister said.
The Agreement is also expected to facilitate trade and ensure efficient clearance of goods traded between the countries.
The draft Agreement takes care of Indian Customs’ concerns and requirements, particularly in the area of exchange of information on the correctness of the Customs value declared, the authenticity of certificates of origin of goods and the description of the goods traded between the two countries.
The draft text of the proposed Agreement has been finalized with the concurrence of the two Customs Administrations.
The Prime Minister visited Koradi Thermal Power Station, where he unveiled a plaque to mark the inauguration.
He presented awards to winners of the Mega Draw under Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi-dhan Vyapar Yojana.
The Prime Minister launched BHIM Aadhaar – a cashless payment mode based on biometric identification of thumb print.
Speaking on the occasion, Shri Narendra Modi said he was delighted to be in Nagpur on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti.
He said he was honoured to have got the opportunity to pray at Deekshabhoomi.
He said that Dr. Ambedkar did not have even a trace of bitterness or revenge in him.
He added that this was Babasaheb Ambedkar’s speciality.
In the context of the Koradi Power Station, the Prime Minister said that the energy sector is of great importance in the 21st century.
He said the Government is devoting significant effort to the renewable energy sector.
Recalling the sacrifices made by people so that India could attain freedom, the Prime Minister asserted that all Indians must have their own house, equipped with electricity, water and other basic facilities.
The Prime Minister said that the BHIM App is positively impacting several lives across the nation.
PM said, ” Self-made and industrious, the contribution of Babu Jagjivan Ram can never be forgotten.
As a freedom fighter and veteran administrator, his service to India was impeccable.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered the inaugural address at the 103rd Indian Science Congress at the University of Mysore.
The theme of this year’s Congress is “Science and Technology for Indigenous Development in India.”
The Prime Minister released the 103rd ISC Plenary Proceedings, and the Technology Vision 2035 document.
He gave away the ISCA Awards for 2015-16.
Following is the text of the PM’s address:-
Bharat Ratna Professor C. N. R. Rao,
For our confidence about the future of India comes from our faith in you.
It is a huge honour and privilege to address the 103rd Science Congress in the centenary year of the University of Mysore.
Some of the tallest leaders of India have passed through the doors of this respected institution.
The history of the Science Congress and the University of Mysore began around the same time.
It was the time of a new awakening in India.
This university is a testimony to the vision of a great generation of Indians.
Now, we have launched yet another revolution of empowerment and opportunities in India.
And, we are once again turning to our scientists and innovators to realize our goals of human welfare and economic development.
The world has progressed because of human instinct to enquire and explore for knowledge but also to address human challenges.
No one reflected this spirit more than late President Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.
And, his life’s mission was a self-reliant and a self-assured India that was strong and cared for its people.
Your theme for this Congress is a fitting tribute to his vision.
And, it is leaders like Professor Rao and President Kalam, and scientists like you, who have placed India at the forefront of science and technology in many areas.
Our success spans from the core of the tiny atom to the vast frontier of space.
We have enhanced food and health security; and, we have given hope for a better life to others in the world.
As we increase the level of our ambition for our people, we will also have to increase the scale of our efforts.
So, for me, good governance is not just about policy and decision making, transparency and accountability.
It is also about integrating science and technology into the choices we make and the strategies we pursue.
Our digital networks are expanding the quality and reach of public services and social benefits for the poor.
And, in the first ever National Space Conference, we identified 170 applications that touch almost every aspect of governance, development and conservation.
We are launching Startup India that will encourage innovation and enterprise.
We are creating technology incubators in academic institutions.
And, I have asked for a framework of Scientific Audit for scientific departments and institutions in the government.
It is with the same spirit of cooperative federalism that is shaping centre-state relations in every area, that I am encouraging greater scientific collaboration between Central and State institutions and agencies.
We will also try to increase the level of resources for science, and deploy them in accordance with our strategic priorities,
We will make it easier to do science and research in India, improve science administration, and expand the supply and improve the quality of science education and research in India.
At the same time, innovation must not be just the goal of our science.
Innovation must also drive the scientific process.
In a world of resource constraints and competing claims, we have to be smart in defining our priorities.
And, it is especially important in India, where challenges are many and the scale is enormous – from health and hunger to energy and economy.
In 2015, the world took two historic steps.
Last September, the United Nations adopted the Development Agenda for 2030.
It places elimination of poverty by the end of 2030 and economic development at the top of our priorities, but with equal emphasis on sustainability of our environment and our habitats.
And, last November in Paris, the world came together to craft a historic agreement to change the course of our planet.
But, we achieved something else that is equally important.
We succeeded in bringing innovation and technology to the heart of the climate change discourse.
We were consistent in our message that it is not enough to speak of targets and restraints.
It is essential to find solutions that help us transition easily to a future of clean energy.
For this, we need research and innovation to make clean energy technology available, accessible and affordable for all.
At Paris, President Hollande, President Obama and I joined a number of global leaders for an Innovation Summit.
We pledged to double national investments in innovation; and, build a global partnership that combines the responsibility of governments with the innovative capacity of the private sector.
I also suggested an international network of 30-40 universities and labs focusing for next ten years on transforming the way we produce, distribute and consume energy.
We will also pursue this in G20.
We need innovation to make renewable energy much cheaper; more reliable; and, easier to connect to transmission grids.
This is especially critical for India to achieve our target of adding 175 GW of renewable generation by 2022.
We must also make fossil fuel like coal cleaner and more efficient.
And, we should tap newer sources of renewable energy, from ocean waves to geothermal energy.
At a time when energy sources that fueled the industrial age have put our planet in peril, and, as the developing world now seeks to lift billions of people into prosperity, the world must turn to Sun to power our future.
So, at Paris, India launched an International Solar Alliance to forge a partnership between solar-rich countries.
We need science and technology not just to make clean energy an integral part of our existence, but also to combat the impact of climate change on our lives.
We have to develop climate resilient agriculture.
We must understand the impact of climate change on our weather, biodiversity, glaciers, and oceans; and, how to adjust to them.
We must strengthen our ability to forecast natural disasters.
We must also address the rising challenges of rapid urbanisation.
This will be critical for a sustainable world.
For the first time in human history, we are in an urban century.
By the middle of this century, two-thirds of the world’s population will live in cities.
A little less than 3.0 billion people will join the existing 3.5 billion urban dwellers.
And, 90% of the increase will come from developing countries.
Many urban clusters in Asia will exceed the population of mid-sized countries elsewhere in the world.
More than 50% of India will be living in urban habitats by 2050.
And, by 2025, India may already have more than 10% of the global urban population.
Studies suggest that nearly 40% of the global urban population lives in informal settlements, or slums, where they face a range of health and nutritional challenges.
That is why I have placed so much emphasis on smart cities.
It is not just about cities that are networked to become more efficient, safe and better in delivery of services.
It is also a vision of sustainable cities that are both locomotives of our economies and havens of healthy living.
We must develop better scientific tools to improve city planning with sensitivity to local ecology and heritage; and, reduce the demand for transportation, improve mobility and reduce congestion.
Much of our urban infrastructure is yet to be built.
We must maximise the use of local material with scientific improvements; and, and make buildings more energy efficient.
We have to find affordable and practical solutions for solid waste management; converting waste into building material and energy; and, recycling waste water.
Urban agriculture and ecology should get more attention.
And, our children must breathe cleaner city air.
And, we need solutions that are comprehensive and rooted in science and innovation.
We need your inputs to make our cities more immune to the consequences of natural disasters and our homes more resilient.
This will also mean making retrofit of buildings affordable.
A sustainable future for this planet will depend not only on what we do on land, but also on how we treat our oceans.
We are at the cusp of a new era, where oceans will become important drivers of our economies.
Their sustainable use can bring prosperity; and, give us clean energy, new medicines and food security beyond just fisheries.
We will set up an advanced centre of research in marine biology and biotechnology and establish a network of coastal and island research stations in India and abroad.
We have entered into agreements on marine science and ocean economy with several countries.
We will also hold an International Conference on “Ocean economy and Pacific Island Countries” in New Delhi in 2016.
Rivers have played as important a role in human history as oceans.
Civilisations have been nurtured by rivers.
And, rivers will remain critical for our future.
So, revival of rivers is an essential part of my commitment for a cleaner and healthier future for our society, economic opportunities for our people, and renewal of our heritage.
River is the soul of Nature.
Their renewal must be an element of a larger effort to sustain Nature.
And, if we wish to restore the harmony between human and Nature, we must also harness the full potential of traditional knowledge.
Societies across the world have developed this enormous wealth through wisdom gathered over the ages.
And, they hold the secrets to economic, efficient, and, environment friendly solutions to many of our problems.
But, today they are at risk of extinction in our globalised world.
Like traditional knowledge, science has also evolved through human experiences and exploration of Nature.
So, we must recognize that science, as we see it, does not constitute the only form of empirical knowledge about the world.
And, we must bridge the distance between traditional knowledge and modern science, so that we can craft local and more sustainable solutions for our challenges.
This is especially important in dealing with growing challenge of lifestyle diseases that take a huge toll in terms of human lives and economic costs.
As a nation we still inhabit many worlds.
We are at the global frontiers of achievements in science and technology.
We also see the uncertainty and despair of many living at the edge of existence, looking for a life of hope, opportunity, dignity and equity.
We must meet these aspirations at a speed and on a scale that is rare in human history.
And, from the richness of our tradition, the consciousness of our age and the strength of our commitment to our world, we must choose the most sustainable path possible.
The success of one-sixth of humanity will also mean a more prosperous and a sustainable future for the world.
We can only do this with your leadership and support.
We will realise it when, in the words of Vikram Sarabhai, “we encourage scientists to interest themselves in problems outside their fields of specialization.”
And, the impact of science will be the most when scientists and technologists will keep the principles of what I call Five Es at the centre of their enquiry and engineering:
Economy – when we find cost effective and efficient solutions.
Environment – when our carbon footprint is the lightest and the impact on the ecology is the least possible.
Energy – when our prosperity relies less on energy; and the energy we use keeps our skies blue and our earth green.
Empathy – when our efforts are in tune with our culture, circumstances and social challenges.
Equity – when science advances inclusive development and improves the welfare of the weakest.
This year we mark a hundred years of a significant moment in the history of science, when Albert Einstein published in 1916 “The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity”.
Nothing can be a higher duty for us, whether we are in public life, or we are private citizens, and whether we are in business or explore science, than to leave the planet in a better state for our future generations.
Let the different disciplines of science, technology and engineering unite behind this common purpose.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed via video conference, the 99th birthday celebrations of Dada Vaswani in Pune.
He also recalled their meeting in Pune in 2013.
The Prime Minister praised Dada Vaswani for his selfless service to humanity.
Appreciating Dada Vaswani’s thoughts on “Making the Right Choice,” the Prime Minister said that if people resolve to make the right choice, evils such as corruption, casteism, drug-abuse, crime etc., can be overcome.
He urged the Sadhu Vaswani Mission to join this effort, in whatever ways it can.
He said that initiatives launched by the Prime Minister, such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Make in India, Swachh Bharat etc. are having a visible impact.
He said India has changed a lot in three years.
He also said that not politics, but right education at the right time, is the key to nation-building.
He said we should all strive to build a nation that all Indians can be proud of.
PM salutes Divyangs on International Day of Persons with Disabilities
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, has saluted the determination of our Divyangs and has conveyed his best wishes to them.
“On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, I salute determination of our Divyang sisters and brothers and convey my best wishes to them.
Reviewing the implementation of Swachhta Action Plans, the Prime Minister said that events such as Swachhta fortnights should be converted into movements towards permanent solutions.
Prime Minister extended a warm welcome to Dr. Abdullah who would be delivering a Keynote Address at the Conference on Counter-terrorism-2016 being held in Jaipur.
Dr. Abdullah Abdullah recalled positively the maiden and successful visit of the Prime Minister to Afghanistan in December 2015.
He said that the visit re-energised the strategic partnership between the two countries.
He deeply appreciated the support being extended by India for infrastructure development and capacity building in Afghanistan.
Prime Minister expressed deep gratitude towards the Government and the National Security Forces of Afghanistan for their bravery and sacrifice in order to protect the Indians, especially during the attack on the Indian Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif on January 4-5, 2016.
Prime Minister reiterated India’s commitment to extend all possible support to the efforts of the Afghan people in building a peaceful, stable, prosperous, inclusive and democratic country.
The two leaders shared views on further deepening the strategic partnership, both in the bilateral and regional context.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the proposal for leasing of 73 sq. mtr. of defence land at Naval Dockyard, Mumbai to M/s.
Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST) at a nominal rent of Rs.1/- per annum.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered the inaugural address at the 106th session of the Indian Science Congress.
Reflecting on the theme of the event this year – ‘Future India: Science and Technology’ – the Prime Minister said that India’s true strength will be in connecting its science, technology and innovation, with its people.
He said that now the time has come to take a step further, by adding “Jai Anusandhan.”
The Prime Minister emphasized that the pursuit of science is fulfilled through the achievement of two objectives: generation of profound or disruptive knowledge; and use of that knowledge for socio-economic good.
As we boost our discovery science ecosystem, we must also focus on innovation and start-ups, the Prime Minister said.
He said that the Government has launched the Atal Innovation Mission to promote innovation among our scientists.
More Technology Business Incubators have been established in the last four years than in the forty years before that, he added.
“Our Scientists must commit themselves to addressing problems of affordable healthcare, housing, clean air, water and energy, agricultural productivity and food processing.
While Science is universal, technology must be local for providing solutions relevant to local needs and conditions,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that big data analysis, artificial intelligence, block-chain etc should be utilised in the agricultural sector, especially to help the farmers with relatively small farm-holdings.
He urged the scientists to work towards ease of living for the people.
In this context, he mentioned issues such as drought management in low rainfall areas; early disaster warning systems; tackling malnutrition; tackling diseases among children such as encephalitis; clean energy; clean drinking water; and cyber security.
He called for time-bound solutions through research, in these areas.
The Prime Minister mentioned major achievements of Indian science in 2018, including:
• production of aviation grade biofuel;
• Divya Nayan – a machine for visually impaired;
• inexpensive devices for diagnosis of cervical cancer, TB and dengue
• a real-time landslide warning system in the Sikkim-Darjeeling region.
He said that strong pathways to commercialization, are needed to leverage our Research & Development achievements, through industrial products.
The Prime Minister called for research, which is a fusion of Arts and Humanities, Social Science, Science and Technology.
Noting that our strengths in research and development are built on the backbone of our national laboratories, central universities, IITs, IISC, TIFR and IISERs, the Prime Minister said that a strong research ecosystem must be developed in the State Universities and Colleges, as well.
He announced that the Union Government has approved a National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems with an investment of over Rs. 3600 crore.
The Mission will cover in a seamless way, R&D, Technology Development, Human resources and Skills, Innovation, Start-up Ecosystem and strong Industry and International Collaborations, he added.
Speaking on achievements in the space sector, the Prime Minister mentioned the success of Cartosat 2 and other satellites.
He said preparations are underway for sending three Indians into space, through the Gaganyaan in 2022.
My fellow citizens,
In God’s creation, humans are endowed with fundamental goodness.
Corruption, black money, and counterfeit notes had become so rampant in India’s social fabric, that even honest people were brought to their knees.
People were forced by circumstances, in defiance of their inherent goodness.
It seemed at times, that the evils and corruptions of society,
knowingly or un – knowingly, intentionally or un- intentionally, had become a part of our daily lives.
Developments post-Diwali have shown, that crores of Indians were looking for an escape from this suffocation.
We have, during the external aggressions, of 1962, 1965, 1971 and Kargil; witnessed the intrinsic strength of our citizens.
We have lived these ideals.
125 crore Indians have shown, in their fortitude, the importance we place in truth and goodness.
This has been written on the sands of time.
Indians have displayed the strength of people power, utmost discipline, and the ability to discern the truth in a storm of disinformation.
They have shown that resolute honesty, can defeat dishonesty.
They have shown how much, even people trapped in poverty, are willing to do, to build a glorious India.
The people, through persistence, sweat and toil, have demonstrated to the world, an unparalleled example of citizen sacrifice, for the brighter future of a nation.
It is historic, that both the people and the government are on the same side in this battle against evil.
The Government is well aware, that in this period, you had to queue up, and face difficulty in withdrawing your own money.
I received letters from many people.
They have shared their pain and sorrow with me, but also emphasized their support.
In this fight against corruption and black money, it is clear that you wish to walk shoulder to shoulder with us.
They have especially been told to proactively resolve the problems in rural and remote areas.
There is no precedent globally, to what India has done.
Nations similar to us do not have the amount of currency that we had.
The excess of cash was fuelling inflation and black-marketing.
It was denying the poor, their due.
Our aim is to achieve a balance.
I am sure, if great sons of India like Jayaprakash Narayan, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Kamaraj had been present today, they would have applauded the patience, discipline and resolve of our countrymen.
In the past few weeks, there have been many gratifying instances – it would take weeks to list them.
It is a healthy trend for any nation, when the people wish to join the mainstream abiding by the law, and helping the Government in serving the poor.
How long will we overlook facts that stare us in the face?
According to information with the Government, there are only 24 lakh people in India who accept that their annual income is more than 10 lakh rupees.
Can we digest this?
Look at the big bungalows and big cars around you.
If we look at any big city, it would have lakhs of people with annual income of more than 10 lakh.
In this fight against corruption and black money, it is natural to debate the fate of the dishonest.
What punishment will they get?
The Law will take its own course, with its full force.
And it aims to build an enabling environment for the dishonest to return to the path of goodness.
It is also a bitter truth, that people have complaints of bad experiences at the hands of Government machinery, and some government officers.
This reality cannot be wished away.
No one can deny that Government officers have a greater responsibility than common citizens.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of all of us in Government, at central, state and local levels, to protect the common man, help the honest, and isolate the dishonest.
These evils have become a festering sore on society and Governments.
Demonetistion has dealt a severe blow to these trades.
Today, youth who had turned to the wrong path, are returning to the mainstream in large numbers.
The fact that so much of the cash in circulation has been deposited in the banking system indicates the success of this mission.
Events of the last few days indicate that escape routes for the dishonest have all been sealed.
Technology has played a big role.
During this period, bank employees have worked day and night.
Female employees too, worked till late hours as part of this mission.
Post office staff, banking correspondents- all did exceptional work.
Amid this herculean effort, some grave crimes by some officers in some banks have come to light.
Some Government officers have also committed serious offences, and tried to take advantage of the situation.
At this historic juncture, I wish to make an appeal to the banks.
History is witness that the Indian banking system has never received such a large amount of money, in such a short time.
While respecting the autonomy of the banks, I appeal to them to move beyond their traditional priorities, and keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities.
India is celebrating the centenary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay as Garib Kalyan Varsh.
Banks should also not let this opportunity slip.
They should take appropriate decisions in public interest promptly.
When policies and programmes are made with clear objectives in mind, not only are beneficiaries empowered, but both short term, and long term benefits are achieved.
Spending is carefully scrutinized, and chances of good results are maximized.
Even so many years after independence, millions of poor do not have their own home.
When black money increased in our economy, houses became out of reach of even the middle class.
The Government has taken some major decisions to ensure homes for the poor, the neo middle class and the middle class.
The number of houses being built for the poor, under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana in rural areas, is being increased by 33 per cent.
In addition to this, another scheme is being put in place for the neo middle and middle class in rural areas.
Friends in the last few weeks, an impression was sought to be created that the agriculture sector has been destroyed.
Farmers themselves have given a fitting reply to those who were doing so.
Fertilizer offtake is up by 9 per cent.
During this period, the Government has taken care to ensure that farmers do not suffer for want of access to seeds, fertilisers and credit.
Farmers who have taken loans for the Rabi crop from District Cooperative Central Banks and Primary Societies, will not have to pay interest on such loans for a period of 60 days.
Farmers who have paid interest during the last two months, will receive these amounts back, directly into their bank accounts.
The loss that NABARD suffers by giving loans to cooperative banks and societies at low interest rates, shall be borne by the Government of India.
The Government has decided, that 3 crore farmers who have Kisan Credit Cards, will be given RuPay debit cards within three months.
Kisan Credit Cards were launched in 1998, but so far, it was essential to go to a bank, to use them.
Just as agriculture is vital for the economy, so are the medium and small scale enterprises also called the MSME sector.
Government has taken some decisions in the interest of small and medium businesses, which will also boost employment.
Government of India underwrites loans given by banks to small businesses through a trust.
So far, loans were covered upto one crore rupees.
Earlier the scheme only covered bank loans.
Hereafter it will cover loans given by NBFCs as well.
Many people connected with this sector have made cash deposits in the last few weeks.
Banks have been asked to take this into account when deciding on working capital.
Now, for such businesses income from digital transactions will be calculated at 6%.
This will effectively reduce their tax liability by 25%.
The progress of the MUDRA Yojana has been very encouraging.
The Government now aims to double this, giving priority to Dalits, Tribals, Backward Classes and Women.
A new scheme is being launched for pregnant women.
We are introducing a nation-wide scheme for financial assistance to pregnant women.
This scheme will help reduce the maternal mortality rate, in a big way.
This will help ensure nutrition before and after delivery, and improve the health of mother and child.
So far, pregnant women in 53 districts were being given financial assistance of 4000 rupees, under a pilot project.
We are initiating a scheme for senior citizens.
Banks often reduce their deposit rates, when they receive a large volume of money.
The interest will be paid monthly.
Political parties, political leaders and electoral funding, figure prominently in any debate on corruption and black money.
I urge all parties and leaders to move away from a “holier than thou approach,” to come together in prioritising transparency, and take firm steps to free politics of black money and corruption.
In our country, people ranging from the common man to the President, have at some point or another, advocated simultaneous conduct of state and national elections.
This is to break the endless cycle of elections, reduce election expenditure, and minimize pressure on the administrative machinery.
More and more people are transacting digitally.
Yesterday, Government has launched a new, swadeshi platform for digital transactions – named BHIM after Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
It will be good if social scientists also do the same.
As a nation, India’s villages, poor, farmers, youth, educated and uneducated men and women, have all displayed infinite patience and people power.
Now, a century later, we witness that the people of India continue to share that feeling towards truth and goodness.
Today, Mahatma Gandhi is not among us.
But the path towards truth that he showed us, is still most appropriate.
As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha, let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness.
We cannot allow this fight against black money and corruption to stop or slow down.
Firmness in truth is a guarantee for success.
A country of 125 crore, with 65 per cent below the age of 35, having the means, the resources, and the capability, has no reason to stay behind.
Let us all come together, to move ahead overcoming obstacles and constraints.

Policy opens a big window for private investments: PPP component must for getting Central assistance
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today approved a new Metro Rail Policy that seeks to enable realization of growing metro rail aspirations of a large number of cities but in a responsible manner.
In view of inadequate availability and even absence of last mile connectivity at present, the new policy seeks to ensure it focusing on a catchment area of five kms. on either side of metro stations requiring States to commit in project reports to provide necessary last mile connectivity through feeder services, Non-Motorised Transport infrastructure like walking and cycling pathways and introduction of para-transport facilities.
States, proposing new metro projects will be required to indicate in project report the proposals and investments that would be made for such services.
Setting up of Urban Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) has been made mandatory which is to prepare Comprehensive Mobility Plans for cities for ensuring complete multi-modal integration for optimal utilization of capacities.
States would also be required to enable low cost debt capital through issuance of corporate bonds for metro projects.
Seeking to ensure financial viability of metro projects, the new Metro Rail Policy requires the States to clearly indicate in the project report the measures to be taken for commercial/property development at stations and on other urban land and for other means of maximum non-fare revenue generation through advertisements, lease of space etc., backed by statutory support.
States are also required to commit to accord all required permissions and approvals.
The new policy empowers States to make rules and regulations and set up permanent Fare Fixation Authority for timely revision of fares.
States can take up metro projects exercising any of the three options for availing central assistance.
Under all these options, private participation, however, is mandatory.
The policy envisages private sector participation in O & M of metro services in different ways.
Metro Projects with a total length of 537 kms are in progress in 13 cities including the eight mentioned above.
New cities acquiring metro services are; Hyderabad (71 kms), Nagpur (38 kms), Ahmedabad (36 kms), Pune (31.25 kms) and Lucknow (23 kms).
Metro projects with a total length of 595 kms in 13 cities including 10 new cities are at various stages of planning and appraisal.

In connection with the above fund, the Union Cabinet also accorded its approval to the following:
(i) Administration and maintenance of the above pool by Ministry of Human Resource Development.
(ii) Accruals from the Cess would be utilized in the ongoing schemes of Secondary and Higher Education.
However, the Ministry of Human Resources Development can allocate funds for any future programme/scheme of secondary and higher education, based on the requirement, as per prescribed procedure,
(iv) The MUSK would be maintained as a Reserve Fund in the non-interest bearing section of the Public Accounts of India.
The major benefit will be enhancing access to secondary and higher education through availability of adequate resources, while ensuring that the amount does not lapse at the end of financial year.
1. Accruals into the proposed non-lapsable fund will be made available for expansion of secondary education and higher education.
2. For Secondary Education:Presently, the Ministry of Human Resources Development envisages that the accruals from the Cess would be utilized in the secondary education for:
• ongoing Rashtriya Madhyamik Shlksha Abhiyan Scheme and other approved programmes including:
• National Means-Cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme and
• National Scheme for Incentives to Girls for Secondary Education.
3. For Higher Education:the accruals would be utilized for:
• ongoing Schemes of Interest Subsidy and contribution for guarantee funds, Scholarship for College & University Students;
• Scholarship (from Block Grant to the institutions) and National Mission on Teachers and Training.
However, the Ministry of Human Resources Development can allocate funds for any programme/scheme of secondary and higher education, based on the requirement & prescribed procedure.
The purpose of levying cess for secondary and higher education is to provide adequate resources for secondary and higher education.
(i) During the 10th Plan, an education cess of 2% on all central taxes was imposed w.e.f.
1.4.2004 to make available additional resources for basic education/elementary education to augment the existing budgetary resources.
A need was felt to give a similar fillip to the effort of the Central Government in universalizing access to secondary education and expanding the reach of the higher education sector.
Therefore, the Finance Minister, in his budget speech of 2007 proposed an additional cess of 1% on central taxes for secondary and higher education.
(ii) A cess @ 1% on central taxes, called the “Secondary and Higher Education Cess” was levied through Finance Act, 2007 to “fulfil the commitment of the Government to provide and finance secondary and higher education” (Section 136 of the Act).
The views of concerned Ministries viz the then Planning Commission, Ministry of North Eastern Region, and Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance were sought in this regard.
The Department of Economic Affairs did not agree to the proposal on the grounds that the Budget allocations for the schemes of Secondary Education and Higher Education have been far more than the amount of 1% cess collected.
Therefore, the amount of the cess collected is deemed to have been fully allocated for the schemes of Secondary and Higher Education in the respective financial years.
Hence, funds on account of 1% cess for the past period are not available now for allocation.
(iv) Subsequently, the HRD Ministry sought the approval of the Department of Economic Affairs for revisiting the issue of creation of “Madhyamik and Uchchatar Shiksha Kosh” (MUSK) on 11th February, 2016.
Department of Economic Affairs on 20th June, 2016 approved that this Ministry may move a draft Cabinet Note to seek the approval of the Cabinet for creation of.

Subsequently, a delegation from UAESA visited ISRO technical facilities on September 16, 2015 and discussed on the avenues of building space cooperation including signing of a MoU.
Government of India’s share during the period 01.01.2017 to 31.03.2020 comes to around Rs. 7932 crore.
Objective of the Scheme
i) To provide partial compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentives so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the first living child.
Target Group
Conditions and installments
Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers who are eligible will receive a cash benefit of Rs.5,000/- in three installment at the following stages as specified in the table given below:
· Early Registration of Pregnancy.
Second installment
· Received at least one antenatal Check-up (after 6 months of pregnancy)
The eligible beneficiaries would continue to receive the remaining cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under existing programmes after institutional delivery so that on an average, a woman will get ₹ 6000/-.
Mode of cash transfer to the Beneficiaries
The conditional cash transfer scheme would be in DBT mode.
The Government of India is committed to ensure that every woman gets adequate support and health care during pregnancy and at the time of delivery and every newborn is immunized on time which is the foundation for better health of the mother and the newborn.

Distinguished religious and spiritual leaders, Venerables from the Maha Sangha, Dharma Gurus,
I am delighted to be here, at the inauguration of Samvad, the Global Hindu-Buddhist Initiative on Conflict Avoidance and Environment Consciousness.
This is truly an esteemed gathering of spiritual leaders, scholars and leaders from several countries of the world where Buddhism is a prevalent way of life.
It is a matter of immense happiness that this conference is being held in India, including in Bodh Gaya.
India is the ideal venue to host a symposium of this nature.
We in India are proud of the fact that it was from this land that Gautama Buddha gave the world the tenets of Buddhism.
Yet, with age grew a distinct consciousness about human suffering, about illness, about old age and about death.
He was convinced that material wealth is not the sole goal.
Human conflicts repulsed him.
And then, he set out, on the path to create a peaceful and compassionate society.
In those days, he had the courage and conviction to hold a mirror to the society, and sought to break free from practices and systems seen as regressive.
Gautam Buddha was a revolutionary.
He nurtured a faith where a human being is at the core, nothing else.
The innermost being of man manifests godliness.
The three themes may appear independent but they are not mutually exclusive.
Infact, they are mutually dependent and supportive.
The second conflict is between nature and man, between nature and development, and also between nature and science.
Ethical values of personal restraint in consumption and environmental consciousness are deeply rooted in Asian philosophical traditions, especially in Hinduism and Buddhism.
Buddhism, along with other faiths, such as Confucianism, Taoism and Shintoism, has undertaken greater responsibility to protect the environment.
Hinduism and Buddhism with their well-defined treatises on Mother Earth can help examine the changes in approach that need to be made.
Climate change is a pressing global challenge.
It calls for a collective human action and a comprehensive response.
The nature, forests, trees and the well-being of all beings play a great role in the teachings of Lord Buddha.
I wrote a book ‘Convenient Action’ which was released by the former President of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.
In my book I have shared my experiences of dealing with climate change as the Chief Minister.
Again I repeat is not the issue of climate change, it is about climate justice.
In my view, the most adversely affected by climate change are the poor and the downtrodden.
When a natural disaster strikes, they are hit the hardest.
We need significant, collective and strategic efforts to prevent bloodshed and violence.
When I spoke at the Unite Nations last year, I briefly mentioned that the world needs to shift from ideological approach to philosophic approach.
A day later when I addressed the Council for Foreign Relations, I expanded on this concept a little more.
The entire Upanishad literature is a compilation of dialogue.
Ideology only believes in unabated truth.
Thus, Hindu and Buddhist religions are in that sense more philosophies and not just belief systems.
It is my firm belief that the solution to all problems lies in dialogue.
Earlier, it was believed that force indicates power.
Now, power must come through the strength of ideas and the effective dialogue.
We have seen the adverse effects of war.
The first half of the 20th century was witness to the horrors of two world wars.
Now, nature of warfare is changing and the dangers are increasing.
What took a hundred thousand men or a prolonged battle can now happen through the click of a button, in a span of minutes.
All of us here have a cardinal duty to ensure that our future generations lead a life of peace, dignity and mutual respect.
We need to sow the seeds of a conflict-free world and, in this endeavour, faiths of Buddhism and Hinduism have a great contribution.
This was how, in ancient India, debates on sensitive issues between scholars avoided such issues being settled in streets.
Adi Sankara and Mandana Mishra held a debate and Sankara won.
But the more important point is not the debate itself but how was the debate was conducted.
It is a fascinating story that will ever remain one of the highest forms of debate for all times for humanity.
It was agreed that if Mandana Mishra lost, he would cease to be a householder (gruhasta) and accept sanyasa.
If Adi Sankara lost, he would give up his sanyasa and marry and settle down as householder or in gruhasta life.
Adi Sankara chose Mandana Mishra’s wife, a scholar herself, as the referee!
If Mandana Mishra lost, she would lose her husband!
This demonstrates the vitality of dialogue and that too dialogue without anger or conflict.
Buddhism and Buddhist heritage have been a uniting and binding factor.
They say that this century is going to be an Asian Century .
I am very clear that without embracing the path and ideals shown by Gautam Buddha, this century cannot be an Asian century!
I see Lord Buddha doing to our collective spiritual well-being what global trade did to our collective economic well-being and the digital internet did to our collective intellectual well-being.
You are visiting a nation that is extremely proud of its Buddhist heritage.
I look forward to seeing you in Bodh Gaya the day after.

Distinguished members of the Russian and Indian delegations,
[Means: An Old friend is better than two new friends.]
Excellency Putin, I am aware of your deep affection for India.
Your personal attention has been a source of strength in our relationship.
And, in the complex and changing global context, your leadership has provided stability and substance to our strategic partnership.
Ours is a truly privileged and unique relationship.
They also help us achieve the objectives of Make in India.
We have also agreed to work on an annual military industrial conference that will allow stakeholders on both sides to institute and push collaboration.
These projects are new chapters in a long history of strong and diverse defence partnership that both sides can take much pride in.
Just minutes ago, with dedication of Kudankulum 2 and laying of foundation concrete of Kundankulum 3 and 4, we saw the tangible results of India-Russia cooperation in the field of Civil Nuclear Energy.
And, with proposed construction of another eight reactors, our wide ranging cooperation in nuclear energy is set to bring rich dividends for both of us.
It also fits in with our needs of energy security, access to high technology and greater localization and manufacturing in India.
We are also undertaking a joint study of a gas pipeline route between our two countries.
A combination of robust civil nuclear cooperation, LNG sourcing, partnership in the Oil and Gas sector, and engagement in renewables can construct a promising ‘Energy Bridge’ between our two countries.
With an eye on the future, we also agreed to set up a Science and Technology Commission.
Through this our societies will reap the benefits of joint development, transfer and sharing of cutting edge technologies in different fields.
And, with President Putin’s backing, we hope to fast track India’s association with Eurasian Economic Union Free Trade Agreement.
The Green Corridor and the International North South Transport Corridor will serve to strengthen trade facilitation, logistical links and ensure better connectivity between our countries.
We also want our economic linkages to connect the regions and states in both countries.
The success of this Summit shines a spotlight on the abiding strength of India-Russia strategic partnership.
It also highlights our strong convergence of views and positions on pressing international and regional issues.
As we approach the seventieth (70th) anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic ties next year, India and Russia are celebrating and building on the achievements of our past.
Our close friendship has given clear direction, fresh impulse, stronger momentum and rich content to our ties.In the emerging regional and global landscape, it has been a source of strength and substance, a driver of peace and a factor of stability.
As one would say it in Russian:
[India and Russia-together to a bright future.]
The main objective of the decision is to enable the State Governments to issue control orders with the prior concurrence of Central Government, for fixing stock limits/licensing requirements in respect of pulses, oilseeds and edible oils, whenever need is felt by them.
This is expected to help in the efforts being taken to improve the availability of these commodities to general public especially the vulnerable sections and control the tendencies of hoarding and profiteering.
Vide Central Government’s Order dated 15.2.2002, certain categories of foodstuffs were removed from the licensing, stock limits and movement restrictions.
Restrictions regarding pulses were first imposed in August 2006 and are extended from time to time.
Oils and oilseeds were added later in April, 2008 and the same were extended from time to time.
The validity of the current Order is expiring on 30.9.2016 seeking further extension considering the prevailing current situation.

The Budget Session of the parliament gets under way today.
This session begins with the address of the President.
In the last session it was our effort and the nation had high hopes that there won’t be any politics on crucial issues like Triple talaq so that the Muslim women will get their rights.
However, despite the orders of the Supreme Court, the bill on triple talaq could not be passed by the Parliament.
I hope and appeal to the political parties across the country to join hands in passing the triple talaq bill to protect the rights of Muslim women.
It will indeed be the best gift of 2018, in the new year for the Muslim women.
Budget Session is very important.
Entire global community is very much optimistic about the Indian economy.
It comes at a time when the world is looking at us, be it the Global Credit rating agencies, World Bank, IMF which have been very positive in their opinion about the growth of India and the road ahead.
This Budget will provide a new energy to the fast growing economy of the country.
It will be fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the common man.
A month after the Budget session, various committees deliberate upon the details of the Budget proposals.
The past experience shows that in those deliberations the national interest is above the political interests.
Our objective should be to reach out to the dalits, oppressed, underprivileged and to those who did not have any access to these benefits.
We also need to see how the villagers, poor, farmers and laborers are benefited maximum from the Budget.
President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
Other Dignitaries on the dais
Distinguished Delegates from India and abroad
Ladies and Gentlemen
I am happy to be here in Mumbai, for the Third Annual Meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
In less than three years, it has in its fold, 87 members.
And a committed capital stock of 100 billion US Dollars.
It is poised to play a critical role in Asia.
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a result of collaborative efforts of Asian countries to provide a better tomorrow to our people.
One of them is to find resources for provision of infrastructure.
I am happy that the theme of this year’s Meeting is “Mobilizing Finance for Infrastructure: Innovation and Collaboration”.
Asia still faces wide ranging disparities in access to education, healthcare, financial services and formal employment opportunities.
Sectors such as energy and power, transportation, telecom, rural infrastructure, agriculture development, water supply and sanitation, environment protection, urban development, and logistics require long term funds.
The interest rates on these funds need to be affordable and sustainable.
In a short period, AIIB has approved 25 projects in a dozen countries with a total financing of over 4 billion US Dollars.
With committed capital of 100 billion dollars and huge need for infrastructure in member countries, I take this opportunity to call upon AIIB to expand from financing 4 billion dollars, to 40 billion dollars by 2020 and 100 billion dollars by 2025.
Such assets, having passed the stages of land acquisition and environment and forest clearances, are relatively de-risked.
Hence, for such assets, institutional investment from pension, insurance and sovereign wealth funds are likely to be more forthcoming.
Another initiative, is the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
This aims to channel investments from both domestic and international sources into infrastructure.
This Fund has received a boost with AIIB committing 200 million US Dollars for investment.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
On each of these parameters, India is well placed and has performed very well.
Let me share with you, some of our experiences and achievements.
With a size of 2.8 trillion US Dollars, it is the seventh largest in the world.
Our macro-economic fundamentals are strong with stable prices, a robust external sector and a fiscal situation firmly in control.
Global confidence in India’s economy is rising.
Total FDI flows have increased steadily – more than 222 billion US dollars have been received in the last four years.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
We have simplified rules and regulations for businesses and undertaken bold reforms.
We have provided investors an environment which is efficient, transparent, reliable and predictable.
We have liberalized the FDI regime.
Today, most sectors are on automatic approval route.
The Goods and Services Tax is one of the most significant systemic reforms that our country has undergone.
It works on the One Nation – One Tax principle.
This would be more than the total requirement of a lot of countries taken together.
Of this, the solar energy capacity will amount to 100 Giga Watt.
And we are well on course to exceed these targets.
The challenge before us is of technology, particularly with respect to storage.
The Sagarmala project has been undertaken for boosting port connectivity, port modernization and port-linked industries.
The Jal Marg Vikas project would augment capacity of navigation on National Waterways for internal trade carried through inland water transport.
While we talk about the conventional concept of infrastructure, I must mention some of the modern day infrastructure on which India has worked.
India has over 460 million internet users and 1.2 billion mobile phones in use.
We are promoting the use of digital payments.
I would like AIIB to look into potential investment opportunities in this field and associate with us.
We have also recently launched Ayushman Bharat, our National Health Protection Mission.
Jobs will also be created for ancillary activities including call centres, research and evaluation and IEC activities.
The entire healthcare industry will receive a boost.
Moreover, with the Government assuring healthcare benefits, the savings of a family, can now be better used for other consumption and investment.
This increased disposable income in the hands of a poor family would lead to increased demand in the economy.
It is an India that stands on the pillars of economic opportunity for all, knowledge economy, holistic development, and futuristic, resilient and digital infrastructure.
In conclusion, I hope that the interactions in this forum will be fruitful and enriching for all.
The proceeds from the bonds will be utilized by IWAI for development and maintenance of National Waterways (NWs) under National Waterways Act, 2016 (effective from 12.4.2016).
Funds received through issue of bonds will be used exclusively for capital expenditure to improve infrastructure funding.
The World Bank has sanctioned a loan of USD 375 million for Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) on 12.04.2017.
The interest payment will be on semi-annual basis and the principal on maturity.
The whole exercise would be undertaken by IWAI through appointment of lead managers and coordination with SEBI.

• The 44th, 45th and 46th Indian Labour Conference recommended enhancement of Maternity Benefits to 24 weeks.
• Ministry of Women & Child Development proposed to enhance Maternity Benefit to 8 months.
• In Tripartite consultations, all stake holders, in general supported the amendment proposal.

I was with Anil Madhav Dave ji till late last evening, discussing key policy issues.
This demise is a personal loss”, the Prime Minister said.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved National Policy on Biofuels – 2018.
3. Farmers are at a risk of not getting appropriate price for their produce during the surplus production phase.
Taking this into account, the Policy allows use of surplus food grains for production of ethanol for blending with petrol with the approval of National Biofuel Coordination Committee.
5. The Policy encourages setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from non-edible oilseeds, Used Cooking Oil, short gestation crops.
6. Roles and responsibilities of all the concerned Ministries/Departments with respect to biofuels has been captured in the Policy document to synergise efforts.
Expected Benefits:
• Cleaner Environment: One crore lit of E-10 saves around 20,000 ton of CO2 emissions.
For the ethanol supply year 2017-18, there will be lesser emissions of CO2 to the tune of 30 lakh ton.
By reducing crop burning & conversion of agricultural residues/wastes to biofuels there will be further reduction in Green House Gas emissions.
• Health benefits: Prolonged reuse of Cooking Oil for preparing food, particularly in deep-frying is a potential health hazard and can lead to many diseases.
Used Cooking Oil is a potential feedstock for biodiesel and its use for making biodiesel will prevent diversion of used cooking oil in the food industry.
• MSW Management: It is estimated that, annually 62 MMT of Municipal Solid Waste gets generated in India.
There are technologies available which can convert waste/plastic, MSW to drop in fuels.
One ton of such waste has the potential to provide around 20% of drop in fuels.
• Infrastructural Investment in Rural Areas: It is estimated that, one 100klpd bio refinery will require around Rs.800 crore capital investment.
Further addition of 2G bio refineries across the Country will spur infrastructural investment in the rural areas.
• Employment Generation: One 100klpd 2G bio refinery can contribute 1200 jobs in Plant Operations, Village Level Entrepreneurs and Supply Chain Management.
• Additional Income to Farmers: By adopting 2G technologies, agricultural residues/waste which otherwise are burnt by the farmers can be converted to ethanol and can fetch a price for these waste if a market is developed for the same.
Also, farmers are at a risk of not getting appropriate price for their produce during the surplus production phase.
Thus conversion of surplus grains and agricultural biomass can help in price stabilization.
In order to promote biofuels in the country, a National Policy on Biofuels was made by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy during the year 2009.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and France in the field of energy efficiency / energy conservation.

Background:-
Later the validity of the Act was initially extended upto 31.3.2002 and thereafter upto 29.2.2004.
The NCSK Act ceased to have effect from 29.2.2004.
After that the tenure of the NCSK has been extended as a non-statutory body from time to time.

The NCSK has been giving its recommendations to the Government regarding specific programmes for welfare of safai karamcharis, study and evaluate the existing welfare programmes for safai karamcharis, investigate cases of specific grievances etc.
Though the Government has taken many steps for the upliftment of the Safai Karamcharis, the deprivation suffered by them in socio-economic and educational terms is still far from being eliminated.
Hence, the Government feels that there is a continued need to monitor the various interventions and initiatives of the Government for welfare of Safai Karamcharis and to achieve the goal of complete eradication of the practice of manual scavenging in the country.

The four-day event, which has been organized by the All India Ulama and Mashaikh Board, brings together several international dignitaries from 20 countries.
The event witnessed the presence of spiritual leaders, scholars, academicians and theologists from Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, UK, USA, Canada, Pakistan and other nations.

The Prime Minister categorically denied any link between religion and terror and added that those spreading terror in the name of religion are nothing but anti-religious.

When young laughter is silenced by guns on the streets, you are the voice that heals,” the Prime Minister told the assembled gathering of Sufi scholars and spiritual leaders.

Elaborating further, Prime Minister opined that for the Sufis, service of God meant service to humanity.

When terrorism and extremism have become the most destructive force of our times, the message of Sufism has global relevance, he added.
Referring to the horrors unleashed across the world by terrorists, he said the impact of terrorism cannot be captured by statistics alone.
“There are forces and groups that are instruments of state policy and design.
There are others recruited to the cause in misguided belief”, the Prime Minister said.
Describing the battle that mankind must fight against terror, he said that this “is not a confrontation against any religion.
It cannot be.
It is a struggle between the values of humanism and the forces of inhumanity.”

He said that the message of Sufism is not just confined to combating terrorism, but also encompasses his creed of “Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikaas”.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for the proposal to promulgate the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015.
This would help trade and commerce in general and allow the lending institution, including banks, to continue to extend financing to the economy, without the apprehension of loan default on account of bouncing of a cheque.
Section 138 of the NI Act deals with the offence pertaining to dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the drawer’s account on which the cheque is drawn for the discharge of any legally enforceable debt or other liability.
The object of the NI Act is to encourage the usage of cheques and enhancing the credibility of the instrument so that the normal business transactions and settlement of liabilities can be ensured.
Various financial institutions and industry associations have expressed difficulties, arising out of the recent legal interpretation of the place of jurisdiction for filing cases under Section 138 to be the place of drawers’ bank by the Supreme Court.
The Bill provides for filing of cases only by a court within whose local jurisdiction the bank branch of the payee, where the payee delivers the cheque for payment is situated.
Further, where a complaint has been filed against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under the new scheme of jurisdiction, all subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court, irrespective of whether those cheques were presented for payment within the territorial jurisdiction of that court.
I want to assure my countrymen that people who take the law into their own handsand are on the path of violent suppression – whether it is a person or a group –neither this country nor any government will tolerate it.
Each and every person will have to abide by the law; the law will fix accountability and the guilty will unquestionably be punished.
We have been hearing in our shaastras, our holy texts, “KshamaVeerasya Bhushanam”, that is, forgiveness is the adornment of the brave.
Shakespeare in his play, “The Merchant of Venice”, while explaining the importance of forgiveness, has written, “Mercy is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes,” meaning, the forgiver and the forgiven both stand to receive divine blessing.
When we speak of Ganesh Chaturthi, it is but natural to talk about Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav, that is, community celebrations of the Ganesh Festival.
It gives the message of love and harmony – awakens new hopes and aspirations, and gives new confidence to the people.
Heartiest felicitations and best wishes to all countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-Zuha.
Festivals are of course symbols of faith and belief; in the New India, we should transform them into symbols of cleanliness as well.
Public cleanliness must be insisted upon not just in our homes but in our villages, towns, cities, states and in our entire country – Cleanliness has to be inextricably linked to our festivals.
And as a result of this I find that, the ecofriendly Ganpati, in this Ganesh Festival has turned into a huge campaign.If you go on YouTube, you will see that children in every home are making earthen Ganesh idols and are colouring them.
What a massive transformation this has been; a pleasant one at that.
My dear countrymen, I call upon you to begin a campaign, Swachchata Hi Sewa, Cleanliness is Service, at least fifteen-twenty days prior to Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October – on the lines of the age-old belief, Jal Seva Yahi Prabhu Seva, Service to Water is Service to God.
Let’s create an environment of cleanliness in the entire country.
It can be in any language; it could be silent too.
The best three participants – three at the district level, three at the state level will be given prizes.
Don’t you feel that whenever a vendor comes to your door to sell something, on his rounds, when we come into contact with small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, auto rickshaw drivers – in fact any person who earns through sheer hard work – we start bargaining with him, haggling with him: “No not so much, make it two rupees less, five rupees less!”
Not just this, when we go to a showroom to buy a saree, we don’t bargain, but when it comes to someone poor, we just cannot resist bargaining.
Can we run a campaign in mission mode?
Teach to Transform, Educate to Empower, Learn to Lead.
With reference to the social schemes related to Financial Inclusion, my question to you is: In the backdrop of the Jan DhanYojna launched in 2014, can you say that, do the statistics show that today, three years later, India is financially more secure and stronger, and whether this empowerment and benefits have percolated down to our women, farmers and workers, in villages and small towns.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, Start Up Yojna, Stand Up Yojna – for Dalits, Adivasis, women, educated youth, youth who want to stand on their own feet – for millions and millions through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna, they have been able to get loans from banks without any guarantee.
I will try my best to bring these to you; and the media can also take advantage of these inspiring stories.

In his address, the Prime Minister reiterated that at a time of global slowdown, India represents a bright spot for investments.
The Prime Minister gave an overview of the steps taken by the Government to address the long-pending concerns of investors.
He also talked about the various opportunities for investment that exist in India.
“We want your active involvement in translating our dreams into reality.
Our commitment and aggressiveness to achieve the goal in a faster and effective manner offers immense opportunities to German Companies.
These opportunities range from building 50 million houses to setting up 100 smart cities; modernization of our railway network and stations to setting up of new railway corridors; generation of 175 GW of renewable energy to construction of transmission and distribution networks, National Highways, bridges, and Metro rails.
Such a huge potential for creation and production will not be available in any one country.
More importantly, no one place on the earth can offer the potential for consumption on such a massive scale.
We are trying to power this potential through our campaigns like Digital India and Skill India.
To tap the energy fully, we have launched the Start up India Campaign,” the Prime Minister said.
“It is the software of India that will move the hardware across the world; It is the talent of India that will master the technology; It is the market of India that will motivate manufacturing.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will be on an official visit to Kutch district of Gujarat from December 18th to 20th, 2015.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the progress under National Health Mission (NHM).
The Cabinet was also apprised of the decisions of the Empowered Programme Committee (EPC) and Mission Steering Group (MSG) of NHM.
Thereafter, NRHM and NUHM became two sub-missions under the overarching NHM.
Cabinet noted the progress under NHM including accelerated decline in MMR, IMR, U5MR and TFR.
It also noted the progress in respect of various disease control programmes like TB, Malaria, Leprosy etc.
The Cabinet noted that:
• Number of endemic blocks with prevalence more than 1 case of Kala Azar per 10000 population was 230 in 2010.
It has been brought down to 94 blocks in 2016.
The MSG also noted the operational guidelines for MMUs.
Implementation Strategy:
• Facilitate increased access and utilization of quality health services by all.
• Forge a partnership between the Central, state and the local governments.

Annual rate of decline in 2014-15 was 4.4%.
India is likely to have achieved the Millennium Development Goal 4 of U5MR at the present rate of decline.
• Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR): (number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) declined from 178 during 2010-12 to 167 during 2011-13.
Subsequent data is yet to be notified by RGI.
India is likely to have achieved the Millennium Development Goal 5 of MMR at the rate of declines that were achieved.
We are likely to achieve the 12th Five Year Plan target for TFR of 2.1 by 2017.
The annual prevalence and mortality from TB have been reduced to half as compared to 1990 level.
By March 2017, 556 districts had achieved the 12th Plan target.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to proposal for dissolution of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited (CIWTC).
The Voluntary Retirement Scheme for CIWTC was implemented in the year 2015 as per decision of ‘the Cabinet on 24.12.2014.
The Company has only five employees at present.
In line with the decision of the Government to revitalize sick CPSUs wherever possible or to wind up irretrievable cases, the dissolution of the CIWTC would be initiated after disposal of movable and immovable assets.
This would free up the assets for better utilization and for the benefit of the people.
This is the third place in Haryana, after Gurugram and Faridabad to be connected like this.
The Prime Minister spoke of how the Metro in Delhi has positively impacted the lives of citizens.
The Metro will make this more convenient, he added.
Shri Narendra Modi said that there is a direct link between connectivity and development.
He said the Metro will mean more employment opportunities for the people in the area.
The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has brought out a policy relating to Metros, to bring uniformity and standardization in metro rail networks across the country.
He said the objective is to build convenient, comfortable and affordable urban transport systems in our cities.
He said that the aim is also to boost “Make in India” by making metro rail coaches in India itself.
The Prime Minister said that the process of making Metro systems is also linked to cooperative federalism.
Wherever Metros are being built in India, the Centre and the respective State Governments are working together, he added.
Noting that New India requires new and smart infrastructure, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government is working on roads, railways, highways, airways, waterways and i-ways.
The Prime Minister will arrive in Dublin, Ireland where he will hold talks with Mr. Enda Kenny, the Taoiseach of Ireland.
He will also have a brief interaction with the Indian community in Ireland, before emplaning for New York City.
During that period, Bloomberg has provided intelligent commentary and incisive analysis of India’s economy.
It has become an essential part of the finance landscape.
Apart from that, I am grateful for the valuable advice that we have received from Mr. Michael Bloomberg in the design of our Smart Cities programme.
As Mayor of one of the world’s great cities, Mr. Bloomberg has personal insight into what makes a city tick.
His ideas have enriched the design of our Smart Cities programme.
Under this programme, we hope to create one hundred cities which will become role models for urban development throughout the country.
The world expects much from India, in terms of contributing to global growth.
To the extent that time permits, I would like to place before you my thoughts on how India intends to meet the challenge.
I will touch upon three major areas.
Firstly, I will discuss India’s economic growth.
Secondly, I will outline some of the administrative and policy reforms that have created and will sustain that growth.
Thirdly, I will elaborate on an aspect of economic development which is of particular importance to me, namely job creation.
Experts are unanimous that India is one of the world economy’s brightest spots.
We have low inflation, a low balance of payments current account deficit, and a high rate of growth.
This was a steeper fall than between 2014 and 2015.
Yet in 2009-10, India’s fiscal deficit, its current account deficit and its inflation rate, all got substantially worse.
And this slid was from a higher base figure for all three.
But in 2015-16, all three have improved, from a lower base.
• Many other emerging economies also depend on imported oil.
If oil prices were the driver of success, those countries would all be showing similar results.
But they are not.
• We have not been lucky with global trade or growth.
Both are low, and have not helped us in terms of export stimulus.
• We have not been lucky with monsoons or weather.
2015 and 2014 have both been drought years.
Drought was compounded by unseasonal hail storms.
For India to be at the top of global growth tables is an unusual situation.
Obviously, there are some who find that difficult to digest and come up with imaginative and fanciful ideas to belittle that achievement.
The fact is that India’s economic success is the hard-won result of prudence, sound policy and effective management.
I will elaborate on some of our policies later, but for now let me emphasize just one; fiscal consolidation.
We have met ambitious fiscal targets in each of the previous two fiscal years.
We have reduced the deficit even while increasing capital expenditure.
And the reduction has come despite an unprecedented steep cut in the Centre’s share of tax revenues, in the award of the fourteenth Finance Commission.
For 2016-17, we have targeted a fiscal deficit of 3.5 per cent of GDP.
This will be the second lowest level in the last 40 years.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance to them in reducing the confusion, by stating facts in place of feelings.
Let us first look at credit.
There has been a smart pick-up in credit growth after September 2015.
Credit off-take between February 2015 and February 2016 increased by 11.5 per cent.
The overall fund flow to the corporate sector through equity and borrowings of various kinds, domestic and foreign, has increased in the first three quarters of 2015-16 by over 30 per cent.
There are some very interesting figures on credit ratings.
In 2013 and 2014, the number of firms whose credit rating was downgraded was much higher than those who were upgraded.
That has now changed decisively.
Upgrades are up and downgrades are down.
Among firms with low levels of leverage, the situation is even better.
Upgrades exceed downgrades by a huge margin.
The only segment showing an increase in downgrades is highly leveraged large firms.
The Government and Reserve Bank have taken tough action to recover dues from large corporate defaulters.
Perhaps the noise from this segment has influenced media perceptions.
Moving from credit to investment, net foreign direct investment in the third quarter of the current financial year was an all-time record.
But to me, more interesting is the dramatic increase in certain important sectors.
These are sectors that are closely connected with the rural economy.
I am thrilled to see that foreign investment is flowing into them.
In the year to September 2015, FDI in construction activities showed 316 per cent growth.
Computer software and hardware had 285 per cent growth.
FDI in the automobile industry grew 71 per cent.
This is concrete evidence that the Make in India policy is having effect in employment intensive sectors.
In a difficult global environment for exports, manufacturing output has fluctuated.
However, several key sub-sectors of manufacturing are growing rapidly.
Motor vehicle production, which is a strong indicator of consumer purchasing power and economic activity, has grown at 7.6 per cent.
The employment-intensive wearing apparel sector has grown at 8.7 per cent.
Manufacturing of furniture has grown by 57 per cent, suggesting a pick-up in sales of flats and houses.
Looking towards the future, let me turn to agriculture.
In the past, the emphasis has been on agricultural output, rather than on farmers’ incomes.
And, as a large share of our population depends on agriculture, a doubling of farmers’ incomes will have strong benefits for other sectors of the economy.
Let me outline our strategy.
• First, we have introduced a big focus on irrigation with a large increase in budgets.
We are taking a holistic approach which combines irrigation with water conservation.
The aim is ‘per drop, more crop’.
• Second, we are focusing on provision of quality seeds and on efficiency of nutrient use.
The provision of soil health cards enables accurate selection of inputs according to the requirements of each field.
These will lower costs of production and increase net income.
• Third, a large portion of the harvest is lost before it reaches the consumer.
In perishables the loss occurs in transit.
In non-perishables, it happens during storage.
We are reducing post-harvest losses through big investments in warehousing infrastructure and cold chain.
We have greatly increased the outlay for agricultural infrastructure.
• Fourth, we are promoting value addition through food processing.
As an example, in response to a call from me, Coca Cola has recently started adding fruit juice to some of its aerated drinks.
• Fifth, we are creating a national agricultural market and removing distortions.
A common electronic market platform is being introduced across 585 regulated wholesale markets.
We want to ensure that a higher share of the final price goes to the farmer, with less going to middlemen.
The introduction of FDI in marketing of domestic food products in this budget is with the same objective.
• Sixth, we have introduced the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.
It is a comprehensive nationwide crop insurance programme which offers farmers protection from risks beyond their control, at an affordable cost.
This scheme will ensure that their incomes are protected in times of adverse weather.
• Seventh, we will increase income from ancillary activities.
Partly this will be through poultry, honey bees, farm ponds and fisheries.
He welcomed the income orientation given to farming.
He went on to say, and I quote,
“On the whole, the budget has tried to be as pro-farmer as possible subject to the limitation of resources.
Seeds have been sown for agricultural transformation and for attracting and retaining youth in farming.
The dawn of a new era in farming is in sight.”
Let me now turn to some of the programmes and policies that underpin our growth.
As I have said before, my goal is ‘Reform to Transform’: the aim of reform is to transform the lives of ordinary people.
Let me start with administrative reforms and our focus on execution.
In a country like India, resources are scarce, while problems are abundant.
An intelligent strategy is to optimize use of resources through efficiency in implementation.
Mere announcement of policies, or so-called policies, achieves little.
Even more than reformed policies, we need transformed execution.
Let me illustrate.
The National Food Security Act was passed in 2013 but remained without implementation in most states.
We are now implementing the Food Security Act nationwide.
We have focused on creating durable assets that benefit the population, rather than the touts.
And instead of talking about the virtues of financial inclusion, we have actually completed the task and brought over 200 million people into the banking system.
Our record on implementation in general, and reduction in corruption in particular, is now well understood.
So I will be brief.
Coal, minerals and spectrum have been auctioned transparently raising large amounts.
Many legacy issues have been solved.
The number of stalled projects has declined.
The long-closed Dabhol power plant is operational again thanks to our coordinated efforts, and is generating power, saving jobs and avoiding bad debts for the banks.
Let me now turn to policy reforms.
I have referred to the durable reduction in inflation since this Government took office.
This is partly attributable to bold measures taken to strengthen monetary policy.
Last year, we entered into a Monetary Framework Agreement with the Reserve Bank of India.
This year we have introduced in the Finance Bill, amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act.
Under these amendments, the RBI will have an inflation target and will set monetary policy through a Monetary Policy Committee.
The committee will have no members from the Government.
Through this reform, monetary policy will acquire an inflation focus and a level of institutional autonomy unprecedented in major emerging markets, and greater than several developed countries.
Another major policy reform is in the petroleum sector.
Under the new Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy, there will be pricing and marketing freedom and a transparent revenue-sharing methodology.
This will eliminate many layers of bureaucratic controls.
For on-going projects which have not been developed, we have also given marketing and pricing freedom, subject to a transparent ceiling based on published import parity prices.
For renewal of existing Production Sharing Contracts, we have introduced a transparent method involving a flat percentage increase in Government profit share.
This removes discretion and uncertainty.
Along with the passing of this long pending bill, we have introduced tax incentives for developers and buyers of housing for the neo-middle class and the poor.
The UDAY scheme in the power sector has permanently changed the incentive structure for State Governments.
Ambitious operational targets are backed by credible incentives to perform.
Under this scheme, in a phased manner, State Governments will have to take over losses of distribution companies and count them against their fiscal deficit targets.
This imposes a hard budget constraint on the states.
It creates a powerful incentive for states to manage the electricity sector efficiently.
Already nine states accounting for over forty per cent of the total debt of distribution companies, have entered into Memoranda of Understanding with the Central Government.
Another nine have agreed to do so.
You are probably aware of this government’s sweeping policy reforms in renewable energy.
From an average of less than 1500 Megawatts of solar capacity addition per annum, we are moving up to 10,000 Megawatts per annum.
When I announced a target of 175 Gigawatts of renewables, as a pillar of our climate change strategy, many were surprised and some were skeptical.
Yet, this month the International Energy Agency has reported that a surge in renewables has already halted global growth in energy-related carbon emissions.
This will increase the number of navigable waterways from 5 to 106.
Foreign Direct Investment policy has been transformed by allowing investment in hitherto closed sectors like Railways and Defence, and enhancing investment limits in insurance and many other sectors.
These reforms are already bearing fruit.
Two new locomotive factories involving an investment of over 5 billion dollars are being built in Bihar, by GE and Alstom.
In insurance, 9600 crore rupees, approximately 1500 million dollars of FDI, in 12 companies, from leading global insurers has already been approved.
We have enhanced the limits for foreign investment in stock exchanges and allowed them to be listed.
I am sure, you are aware, of the reforms we have undertaken to promote private equity venture capital, and an eco-system for start-ups.
I note that this ‘new economy’ is the focus of your panel discussions.
Finally, let me turn to the major steps we have taken in the area of generating employment.
This is one of my highest priorities.
India is a capital scarce, labour abundant country.
Yet, the corporate tax structure has favoured capital intensive production.
Tax benefits like accelerated depreciation, and investment allowance have created an artificial bias against labour.
We have taken two important steps to change this.
Firstly, if any firm subject to tax audit increases its work force, it will get a 30 per cent weighted tax deduction on the extra wage cost for three years.
Earlier, such a benefit was available only to very few industrial employers and had so many restrictions that it was practically ineffective.
It will now cover all sectors including services, for employees with a salary up to 25,000 rupees per month.
Secondly, the Government has taken the responsibility for paying pension contributions for three years for all new persons enrolling in the Employee Provident Fund.
This will apply to those with wages up to 15,000 rupees per month.
We expect lakhs of the unemployed, and the informally employed, to benefit from these steps.
In a reform to eliminate corruption in government recruitments, we have abolished interviews for lower and middle level positions.
They will now be filled on the basis of transparent examination results.
You are aware that results of Government entrance examinations for engineering and medical colleges are being used by private colleges also.
I am happy to announce one more measure to improve the labour market and benefit the unemployed.
The Government and Public Sector Undertakings conduct a number of recruitment examinations.
So far, the scores in these examinations have been retained by the Government.
Hereafter, we will make available the results and the candidate information openly to all employers, wherever consent is given by the candidate.
This will create a positive externality.
It will provide a rich data base which can be used by private sector employers as a ready-made and objective sourcing and screening mechanism.
It will reduce search costs in the labour market for both employers and employees.
It will enable better matching of candidates from labour surplus areas with jobs in other regions.
You may be aware of the spectacular progress of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Over 31 million loans have been sanctioned to entrepreneurs for a total value of nearly 19 billion dollars this year.
You will be pleased to know that 77 per cent of these entrepreneurs are women and 22 per cent of them are from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Even if we assume conservatively that on average, each enterprise creates just one sustainable job, this initiative itself amounts to 31 million in new employment.
The Stand-Up India scheme will also provide 250,000 entrepreneurship loans to women and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
My government’s measures on skill development are well known.
To start with, we will provide an enabling regulatory architecture to ten public and ten private institutions, so that they emerge as world-class teaching and research institutions.
Their regulatory framework will be separate from existing structures like the University Grants Commission and All India Council for Technical Education.
They will have complete autonomy on academic, administrative and financial matters.
We will provide additional resources for the next five years for the ten public universities.
This will eventually allow ordinary Indians affordable access to world-class degree courses.
This initiative is the beginning of a journey to restore the original mandate of higher education regulators.
They should be facilitators and guides, driven by norms of self-disclosure and transparency, instead of top-down command and control.
Eventually, through regulatory reform, we aspire to world-class standards in all colleges and universities.
Another initiative is in school education.
We have achieved much quantitative progress in access and pupil-teacher ratios.
The foundation of today’s knowledge economy is the quality of its school leavers.
We have now decided that the quality of learning outcomes will be the Government’s primary objective.
Accordingly, we will allocate an increasing share of resources under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan to quality.
These funds will be used to promote local initiatives and innovations to improve learning outcomes.
I am sure, all of you who are parents and all of you who are employers, will welcome these steps in higher and school education respectively.
What we have achieved so far, gives me the confidence that, with the support of the people, we can transform India.
I know it will be difficult.
But I am sure it is do-able.
And I am confident, it will be done.

Your Excellency, President Ramaphosa, Distinguished guests who came here from South Africa,
And his visit to India is happening during a special moment in our relations.
This is the 150th birth anniversary year of Mahatma Gandhiji.
I am very happy that President Ramaphosa has come to India on this special occasion.
India is grateful for all this respect and pride they are giving us.
Whole India is grateful to him for allowing us this distinction.
I first met President Ramaphosa when I went to South Africa in 2016.
At that time, he was the Vice-President.
Though it is winter season in Delhi, but I believe that in this journey President Ramaphosa will also feel the warmth of India’s welcome.
I warmly welcome the President, and his delegation, in India.
During our interactions today with the President, we reviewed all the dimensions of our relations.
South Africa participated as the Partner Country in the “Vibrant Gujarat” summit held this year.
And Indian companies are taking active part in the efforts of President Ramaphosa to increase investment in South Africa.
The Gandhi-Mandela Skills Institute is set to be established soon in Pretoria.
And we both are committed to take these relationships to a new level.
And therefore, we will meet major business leaders of both the countries in a short while from now.
We are the successors to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
And therefore, the broad global outlook of both the countries is quite similar to each other.
A special part of the program of this visit of the President to India will be the first “Gandhi-Mandela Freedom Lecture” which is being organized today.
I, once again, warmly welcome the President.
There was a time when development was believed to depend on the quantity of capital and labour.
Today we know that it depends as much on the quality of institutions and ideas.
Early last year, a new institution was created, namely, the National Institution for Transforming India or NITI.
NITI was created as an evidence based think tank to guide India’s transformation.
One of NITI’s functions is:
– to mainstream external ideas into Government policies, through collaboration with national and international experts;
– to be the Government’s link to the outside world, outside experts and practitioners;
– to be the instrument through which ideas from outside are incorporated into policy-making.
The Government of India and the State Governments have a long administrative tradition.
This tradition combines indigenous and external ideas from India’s past.
This administrative tradition has served India well in many ways.
Above all, it has preserved democracy and federalism, unity and integrity, in a country of glorious diversity.
These are not small achievements.
Yet, we now live in an age where change is constant and we are variables.
We must change for both external and internal reasons.
Each country has its own experiences, its own resources and its own strengths.
Thirty years ago, a country might have been able to look inward and find its own solutions.
Today, countries are inter dependent and inter connected.
No country can afford any longer to develop in isolation.
Change is also necessary for internal reasons.
There was a time when elders in a family knew more than those who were younger.
Today, with the spread of new technology, the situation is often reversed.
This increases the challenge for government in communicating and in meeting rising expectations.
If India is to meet the challenge of change, mere incremental progress is not enough.
A metamorphosis is needed.
That is why my vision for India is rapid transformation, not gradual evolution.
• The transformation of India cannot happen without a transformation of governance.
• A transformation of governance cannot happen without a transformation in mindset.
• A transformation in mindset cannot happen without transformative ideas.
We have to change laws, eliminate unnecessary procedures, speed up processes and adopt technology.
We cannot march through the twenty first century with the administrative systems of the nineteenth century.
Fundamental changes in administrative mindsets usually occur through sudden shocks or crisis.
India is fortunate to be a stable democratic polity.
In the absence of such shocks, we have to make special efforts to force ourselves to make transformative changes.
As individuals, we may absorb new ideas by reading books or articles.
Books open the windows of our minds.
However, unless we brainstorm collectively, ideas remain confined to individual minds.
If we sit together, we will have the collective force to convert ideas into action.
What we need is a collective opening of our minds, to let in new, global perspectives.
As many of you know, ever since taking office, I have personally participated in structured brainstorming sessions with bankers, with police officers and with Secretaries to Government, among others.
The ideas coming from those sessions are being incorporated into policy.
These efforts have been to tap ideas from inside.
The next step is to bring in ideas from outside.
Culturally, Indians have always been receptive to ideas from elsewhere.
We will draw the best from the wisdom and knowledge of eminent persons, who changed, or influenced change in the lives of many, to make their nation a better place in the planet.
This lecture will be the first in a series.
You have all been given a feedback form.
I look forward to your detailed and frank feedback to help us improve this process.
I request you to suggest names of experts and panelists from inside and outside India.
I also request all Secretaries to Government to conduct a follow up discussion in a week’s time, with the participants from their Ministries.
The purpose is to convert ideas that emerge in today’s session into specific action points relevant to each group.
Wherever possible, I request the Ministers also to participate in these sessions.
One of the greatest reformers and administrators of our time was Lee Kuan Yew, who transformed Singapore to what it is today.
It is therefore fitting that we are inaugurating this series with Shri Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore.
He is a prolific scholar and public policy maker.
Apart from being Deputy Prime Minister, he is also the Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies, Minister of Finance and Chairman of Monetary Authority of Singapore.
In the past, he has served as the Minister of Manpower, Second Minister of Finance and Minister of Education.
He has another Master’s degree in Public Administration from Harvard University.
At Harvard, he was honoured with the Littauer Fellow award for his outstanding performance.
Shri Shanmugaratnam is one of the world’s leading intellectuals.
I would like to give you an example of the range and sweep of his ideas.
Today, Singapore’s economy depends a lot on transshipment.
But if global warming melts the polar ice caps, new navigation routes may open and possibly reduce Singapore’s relevance.
I am told he has already started thinking about this possibility and planning for it.
The list of achievements and honours received by Shri Shanmugaratnam is long.
But we are all eager to listen to him.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in his Labour Day message, has saluted the determination and hard work of countless workers who play a big role in India’s progress.
“Today, on Labour Day we salute the determination and hard work of countless workers who play a big role in India’s progress.
Shrameva Jayate!”, the Prime Minister said.
The National Security Chiefs briefed the Prime Minister about their deliberations at the meeting.
Prime Minister Modi called upon the BIMSTEC Member States to come together to counter common security threats, such as terrorism; extremism and radicalization; drugs, arms and human trafficking; and natural disasters.
The Prime Minister also said that BIMSTEC Member States should also work together to address non-traditional security threats, such as in the domain of cyber security and in maritime domain.
Further the rights of surrogate mother and children born out of surrogacy will be protected.
The Bill shall apply to whole of India, except the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The major benefits of the Act would be that it will regulate the surrogacy services in the country.
While commercial surrogacy will be prohibited including sale and purchase of human embryo and gametes, ethical surrogacy to the needy infertile couples will be allowed on fulfilment of certain conditions and for specific purposes.
As such, it will control the unethical practices in surrogacy, prevent commercialization of surrogacy and will prohibit potential exploitation of surrogate mothers and children born through surrogacy.
No permanent structure is proposed to be created in the Draft Bill.
Neither there are proposals for creating new posts.
The proposed legislation, while covering an important area is framed in such a manner that it ensures effective regulation but does not add much vertically to the current regulatory structure already in place at the central as well as states.
Accordingly, there will not be any financial implications except for the meetings of the National and State surrogacy Boards and Appropriate Authorities which will be met out of the regular budget of Central and State governments.
India has emerged as a surrogacy hub for couples from different countries and there have been reported incidents concerning unethical practices, exploitation of surrogate mothers, abandonment of children born out of surrogacy and rackets of intermediaries importing human embryos and gametes.
Widespread condemnation of commercial surrogacy prevalent in India has also been regularly published in different print-and electronic media since last few years highlighting the need to prohibit commercial surrogacy and allow ethical altruistic surrogacy.
The 228th report of the Law Commission of India has also recommended for prohibiting commercial surrogacy and allowing ethical altruistic surrogacy to the needy Indian citizens by enacting a suitable legislation.
Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that our country is a “Bahuratna Vasundhara” where many people have made great contributions across regions and time periods.
The Prime Minister said that Vakil Saheb – Laxmanrao Inamdar – was one such person.
The Prime Minister emphasized that the first principle of the cooperative movement is to unite everyone, even while remaining anonymous.
The Prime Minister spoke of the goals such doubling farmers’ income by 2022, and balanced development in rural and urban areas.
He said the process needs to be reversed, to eliminate middlemen and help raise incomes.
The Prime Minister mentioned neem coating of urea, bee keeping, and sea-weed cultivation, as areas where the cooperative movement could contribute significantly.
The Prime Minister released two books: one on Shri Laxmanrao Inamdar, and one titled “Nine Gems of Indian Cooperative Movement.”
Friends, very few regions of the world have such intensive historical interfaces as this region has.
Today, we all symbolise a shared heritage not only economically but also culturally.
Friends, in today’s modern era our traditional relationship has attained a new dimension.
The Asian countries are not only catering to the goods and services markets in their own country but their reach has expanded to other continents as well.
Today’s event is a reflection of how seriously we understand the needs of our citizens, how hard we strive to overcome their difficulties.
Every citizen is a consumer too and hence this event symbolizes our collective determination.
For the first time in 1985, the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection were framed.
They were revised two years ago.
India has also played an active role in the process of revision.
The Posts in the organisational structure in the Kautilya period may be considered as Director of Trade and the Superintendent of Standards in today’s context.
Friends, we consider consumer as gods.
Friends, India is one of the first few countries to legislate Consumer Protection Act in 1986, just one year after adoption of UN Guidelines.
Protection of consumer interests is a priority of the government.
This is also reflected in our resolution of the New India.
Moving beyond Consumer Protection, New India will have Best Consumer Practices and Consumer Prosperity.
Friends, today we are in process of enacting a new Consumer Protection Act keeping in view the business practices and requirements of the country.
The proposed Act lays great emphasis on consumer empowerment.
Rules are being simplified to ensure that Consumer grievances are redressed in a time-bound manner and at least possible cost.
Stringent provisions are proposed against misleading advertisements.
A Central Consumer Protection Authority with executive powers will be constituted for quick remedial action.
We have enacted the Real Estate Regulatory Act for the protection of home buyers.
Earlier, consumers waited for years to get the possession of their homes as they would fall prey to unscrupulous builders.
Moreover, booking amount has been fixed only at 10 per cent.
Earlier, the builders used to divert the money received for bookings to other projects.
Now government has made a stringent provision that 70 per cent of the payment received from buyers will be kept in an “Escrow” account and this amount will be spent on that project only.
Similarly, the Bureau of Indian Standard Act has also been enacted.
Now any commodity or service related to public or consumer interest can be brought under compulsory certification.
This Act also has provisions to order recall of substandard products from the market and for compensation in case of loss or damages incurred by the consumer.
Recently, India has also implemented Goods and Services Tax-GST.
The queues of the trucks on the borders now no longer exist.
It is a transparent system in which no one can hurt the interests of the Consumers.
Increased competition due to the GST will lead to moderation in prices.
It will directly benefit poor and middle class consumers.
Friends, besides strengthening the interests of the consumers through the law, it is also necessary that the grievances of the people are promptly addressed.
In the last three years, our government has created a new eco-system for Grievance Redressal by making efficient use of technology.
About 40 percent complaints get transferred directly to the companies automatically through the portal enabling quick action.
I can confidently state that this govt. has used social media positively for Consumer Protection in India, as has never been done before.
Development of any country and consumer protection are complementary.
Good governance has an important role in taking the benefits of development to every citizen.
All these efforts are for providing Basic Lifeline support to people and to make their lives more comfortable.
Interests of consumers are not protected by merely giving them rights.
In India we are also working to formulate schemes which help consumers save money.
The poor and middle class in the country is benefitted most from these schemes.
You might also be aware that UNICEF has recently announced findings of a survey in India.
According to the survey, considering medical costs averted, value of time savings and mortality averted, financial savings for each household in Open Defecation Free communities are Rs. 50,000 per year.
Friends, Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojna has been launched to provide affordable medicines to the poor.
More than 500 medicines have been included in the list of essential drugs and their prices have been reduced.
Capping prices of Coronary Stents have made them cheaper by up to 85 per cent.
Recently, prices of knee implants have also been brought under control.
Our thinking is to move beyond Consumer Protection to promotion of Consumers Interest.
After government’s efforts, the same bulb is now available in just Rs. 40 to 45-/ under the scheme.
By strengthening the Public Distribution System through technology, it is also being ensured that the poor, who have the right to affordable food grains, get their due.
Under the Direct Benefit Scheme, by transferring the money directly into the beneficiaries’ bank accounts the government has prevented leakage of more than Rs. 57 thousand crores.
Subsidy is provided on LPG cylinders in our country.
On my appeal, within a short time of around one year, more than one crore people have given up their gas subsidy.
The savings thereon have been used in giving free gas connections to 3 crore households so far.
It is an example that how the shared contribution from each consumer benefits other consumers thus creating a positive environment in the society towards one’s duties.
Friends, Government is implementing Prime Minister Rural Digital Literacy Campaign for Digital Empowerment of Consumers living in rural areas of the country.
Under this scheme, one person each from 6 crore households is being made digitally literate.
This campaign will facilitate villagers for electronic transactions and availing Government services digitally.
The openness of our economy welcomes every country in the world, brings Indian consumers closer to the global players.
Every country represented here is engaged in its own way for protecting the interests of their consumers.
Friends, Asian countries provide large business opportunities because of large consumer base of more than 4 billion, increasing purchasing power and young demographic profile.
Under these circumstances, a strong regulatory system in every country and information sharing is a must for sustaining consumer confidence.
Taking pride in our culture while respecting other cultures is part of our tradition.
Over the centuries, we have been learning from each other and Trade and Consumer Protection are also an integral part of this process.
I hope that keeping in view the future challenges a roadmap with a clear vision for moving forward will be prepared in this conference.
I am hopeful that we will also succeed in institutionalizing regional cooperation through this conference.
I once again express gratitude to you for participating in this conference.
Thanks a lot!

I place great value on Germany’s assistance of over one billion Euros for India’s Green Energy Corridor and a new assistance package of over a billion Euros for solar projects in India.
We also intend to deepen research cooperation in clean and renewable energy, and energy efficiency.
Our partnership will also grow in areas like defence manufacturing, trade in advanced technology, intelligence, and countering terrorismand radicalism.
These are important security dimensions of our expanding relationship.
I welcome Germany’s strong support for India’s membership of the international export control regimes.
As we discussed in the G4 Summit in New York, Chancellor and I are committed to pursue reforms of the United Nations, especially the Security Council.
I especially thanked her for Germany’s invaluable support for peace, security and development in Afghanistan.
Finally, a very special word of gratitude to Chancellor Merkel and the people of Germany for the return of the 10th century statue of Durga in her Mahishasurmardini avatar from Jammu and Kashmir.
She is a symbol of the victory of good over evil.
This also suggests that in this age of transitions and turmoil, India-Germany partnership will be a force of good for the world.
It is a saying common to both our cultures that friendship is a plant that needs to be watered.
I am confident that after this extraordinary session, the tree of our friendship will blossom.
Namaskar, distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am happy to be present here for the inaugural function of the Vision Conclave as a part of the Global Ayurveda Festival organized in God’s own country – Kerala.
Kerala is the hub of traditional Ayurveda.
It is heartening to note that foreign delegates in large numbers have come from various countries to participate in the Ayurveda festival.
I am sure their participation in this festival will provide a lot of impetus to the spread of Ayurveda.
In India we have had a long great tradition of saints and hermits who evolved our own indigenous systems of healthcare, like Ayurveda, Yoga and Siddha.
Over time, we also interacted with different civilizations and assimilated other systems of medicine as well.
Sushruta defines health as:
The Ayurvedic ‘dincharya’ or daily schedule helps to bring about peace and harmony in one’s life.
Ayurvedic daily life routines are meant to enhance the total health of a human being, both mental and physical.
What are the great health challenges that the world is facing today?
Non-communicable diseases, lifestyle related diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and cancers have become the greatest health challenges.
It is in managing these that Ayurveda offers solutions.
Unfortunately, the real potential of Ayurveda is untapped because of many reasons.
Most importantly because of inadequate scientific scrutiny and concerns regarding standards and quality.
If these issues are addressed properly, I am sure Ayurveda can provide solutions to many health problems.
India can be a leader in making affordable, holistic health care available to the world.
What can we do, and what are we doing to address these issues?
Our government is fully committed to promotion of Ayurveda and traditional systems of medicine.
For quality control of AYUSH drugs, steps are being taken to bring regulatory amendments for effective enforcement and strengthening the regulatory framework at the Central and State levels.
Creating a vertical structure for AYUSH drugs in Central Drug Standards Control Organization, control over misleading advertisements and extension of financial support to the States under National AYUSH Mission for quality control activities are important initiatives that are underway.
The WHO strategy contains methodologies for harnessing the potential contribution of Traditional and Complementary Medicine to health, wellness and person-centered healthcare.
In the words of Swami Vivekananda, therefore, we shall- “COMBINE THE BEST OF EAST WITH THAT OF THE WEST”.
However, we do need to look beyond.
We need to look beyond providing healthcare and engage in the pursuit of good health, a combination of physical and mental well being.
The escalating costs of treatment, the side effects of medicines have prompted medical experts to think of widening their horizons to traditional systems of medicine.
Young entrepreneurs who are planning a start-up could find a lot of opportunities in holistic healthcare.
In the context of health sector planning, while we think of the utility and contemporary relevance of Ayurveda and other traditional medical systems, it is also important to ponder over the realities and the challenges faced by these systems.
Traditional medicine is affordable to many of the rural people.
It is locally available to the communities, time-tested for its safety and efficacy.
Above all, it imbibes the culture and eco-system of the communities within which it grows.
In many parts of developing countries, traditional medical practices are the only resources of healthcare within the physical and financial reach of the poor people.
It is therefore even more important that we ensure the quality of these systems.
All stakeholders of Ayurveda gathered here must agree that it is important for us to address the issues of safety, efficacy, quality, access and rational use of our traditional medical knowledge of Ayurveda.
We should also move closely with the emerging trends in the areas of bio-medicine, health technology and information technology.
I know that there have been great efforts in China to develop and establish policies and regulations for promoting the safe use of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which comprises a large chunk of the international trade of Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
I am also told that the Delhi Declaration on Traditional Medicine adopted by the South East Asian Countries in February 2013 and later resolved by the WHO Regional Committee seeks member countries to follow harmonized approaches for developmental activities of Traditional Medicine.
I hope, proper implementation of articles of the Delhi Declaration will help to achieve systematic development of traditional medicine including Ayurveda as well at national, regional and global level.
We would like to offer our institutions as referral centres for training, capacity building and information & technology exchange programs in Ayurveda and other AYUSH systems.
Ladies and Gentlemen, as you are well aware, India has a long history and rich heritage of Ayurveda and Yoga.
The multi-cultural origins of Ayurvedic knowledge are revealed in the classical texts themselves.
Both Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita urge physicians to seek the help of cowherds, hunters and forest-dwellers for procuring medicinal plants.
In the Charaka Samhita, we notice the participation and contribution of a Central Asian physician in one of the assemblies of scholars gathered to formulate the principles of Ayurveda.
The three major classical texts give importance to Buddhist moral values.
Vagbhata, who is said to be the author of one of the classical texts Ashtangahridayam, was a Buddhist.
It is evident, therefore, that these traditions grew by sharing knowledge, both locally as well as across cultures.
They learnt from the most humble as well as those with arcane knowledge.
We will continue this effort.
The Global Ayurveda Festival takes this vision forward.
I wish the Vision Conclave as well as Global Ayurveda Festival a grand success.
I trust that the deliberations will focus on the crucial issues important for the global positioning of Ayurveda.
I will end with words from Ashtangahridayam, one of the most famous texts of Ayurveda.
The poor, those suffering from disease and those afflicted by sorrow should be helped.
Even insects and ants should be treated with compassion, just as one’s own self.
This is the guiding spirit of Ayurveda.
Let this be the guiding spirit for all of us.

A student preparing for the UPSC examination also asked a similar question.
In response, the Prime Minister said that while he would not advise anyone to stay completely unaffected by an examination, it is important to understand the context of the examination.
Is an examination, an exam for life, or is it an exam for a particular grade like Class 10 or 12, he asked the gathering.
He said that once this context is understood, the stress will reduce.
The Prime Minister emphasized that parents should not expect their children to fulfil their own unfulfilled dreams.
Answering a set of questions on stress of parents, and parental pressure, the Prime Minister said that the performance of children cannot become a calling card for the parents.
He said that if that becomes the aim, then expectations become unrealistic.
Those aspirations should also be expressed, and we should collectively raise our abilities to meet those aspirations, he added.
A parent expressed an apprehension that her son was once good in studies, but is now distracted by online games.

However, he added that technology should lead to an expansion of the mind.
It should be a means to innovate.
The PlayStation is good, but one must not forget the playing field, he added.

Students asked the Prime Minister how studies could be made more fun, and how exams could improve one’s personality.
The Prime Minister said that it is important to take tests and exams in the right spirit.
He said tests make a person stronger, and one should not abhor them.
They also said that every student has different strengths, so how can each student be expected to be good in maths and science.
In response, the Prime Minister said that clarity of thought and conviction are essential.
There are opportunities in so many areas now, the Prime Minister said.
He said that when one competes with one’s own past record, then pessimism and negativity can easily be defeated.
Students also mentioned the need to further improve education systems and ensure that exams are not only reduced to rote learning but also showcase what students have learnt.
Speaking on the subject of depression, the Prime Minister said that in a nation like ours, this issue is worrying.
He said Indian culture has mechanisms to deal with this.
The more we talk openly about aspects relating to depression and mental health, the better it is, he added.
He said that a person does not get depressed all of a sudden.
There are signs that show a person is heading into depression.
Ignoring these signs is not a good idea.
On the contrary, we must talk about this, the Prime Minister said.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the National Mineral Exploration Policy (NMEP).
The NMEP primarily aims at accelerating the exploration activity in the country through enhanced participation of the private sector.
There is a need for comprehensive mineral exploration of the country to uncover its full mineral potential so as to put the nation’s mineral resources (non-fuel and non-coal) to best use and thereby maximize sectoral contribution to the Indian economy.
The policy emphasizes on making available baseline geoscientific data of world standards in the public domain, quality research in a public-private partnership, special initiatives for search of deep-seated and concealed deposits, quick aerogeophysical surveys of the country, and creation of a dedicated geoscience database etc.
NMEP has the following main features for facilitating exploration in the country:-
i. The Ministry of Mines will carry out auctioning of identified exploration blocks for exploration by private sector on revenue sharing basis in case their exploration leads to auctionable resources.
The revenue will be borne by the successful bidder of those auctionable blocks.
ii. If the explorer agencies do not discover any auctionable resources, their exploration expenditure will be reimbursed on normative cost basis.
iii. Creation of baseline geoscientific data as a public good for open dissemination free of charge.
iv. Government will carry out a National Aerogeophysical Program for acquiring state-of-the-art baseline data for targeting concealed mineral deposits.
v. A National Geoscientific Data Repository is proposed to be set up to collate all baseline and mineral exploration information generated by various central & state government agencies and also mineral concession holders and to maintain these on geospatial database.
vi. Government proposes to establish a not-for-profit autonomous institution that will be known as the National Centre for Mineral Targeting (NCMT) in collaboration with scientific and research bodies, universities and industry for scientific and technological research to address the mineral exploration challenges in the country.
vii. Provisions for inviting private investment in exploration through attractive revenue sharing models.
viii. On the lines of UNCOVER project of Australia, the government intends to launch a special initiative to probe deep-seated/ concealed minerals deposits in the country in collaboration with National Geophysical Research Institute and the proposed NCMT and Geoscience Australia.
In order to implement the recommendations of the NMEP, initially an amount of about Rs.2116 crore over 5 years would be required over and above the annual plan budget of the Geological Survey of India under the Ministry of Mines.
The NMEP will benefit the entire mineral sector across the country.
3) Government will launch a special initiative to probe deep-seated/concealed mineral deposits in the country.
Characterizing India’s geological cover, investigating India’s lithospheric architecture, resolving 4D geodynamic and metallogenic evolution, and detecting and characterizing the distal footprints of ore deposits, would be the main components of this initiative.
4) A National Aerogeophysical Mapping program will be launched to map the entire country with low altitude and close space flight to delineate the deep-seated and concealed mineral deposits.
6) Public expenditure on regional and detailed exploration will be prioritized and subject to periodical review based on assessment of criticality and strategic interests.
However, these initiatives have fetched only limited success.
Further, over the years the dynamics of the mineral sector have undergone sea change thereby creating new demands and imperatives.
There is a compelling need to provide an impetus to exploration activity in the country.
This has prompted the Government to carry out a comprehensive review of its exploration policy and strategy.
The amendments brought in to the MMDR Act in 2015 is a step in this direction.
The most important feature of this amendment is that mining leases (ML) and prospecting license-cum-mining lease (PL-cum-ML) will be granted only through an auction process.
This is expected to bring in transparency, expeditiousness and simplification in procedures in grant of mineral concessions.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi and all the Martyrs who gave their lives for the Nation, on Martyrs’ Day.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today gave its approval for amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2015 taking into consideration the Law Commission’s recommendations, and suggestions received from stake holders.
The Government of India has decided to amend the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by introducing the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 in the Parliament.
The salient features of the amendments are as under:-
Further, if a person is having specified relationship, he shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator.
(ii). Insertion of a new provision that the Arbitral Tribunal shall make its award within a period of 12 months.
Parties may extend such period up to six months.
Thereafter, it can only be extended by the Court, on sufficient cause.
(iii). It is proposed to insert a provision for fast track procedure for conducting arbitration.
Parties to the dispute may agree that their dispute be resolved through fast track procedure.
Award in such cases shall be given in six months period.
(v). A new provision to provide that application to challenge the award is to be disposed of by the Court within one year.
Award can only be stayed where the Court passed any specific order on an application filed by the party.
The Government of India has under its consideration proposals for making Arbitration a preferred mode for settlement of commercial disputes by making it more user-friendly and cost effective.
This will lead to expeditious disposal of cases.
The Govt. of India is committed to improve its legal framework relating to Arbitration.
A country with an abiding faith in the tradition of Jirga has chosen the path of democracy.
And, it has done it against challenges that would have defeated a lesser people.
It is a tribute to the countless, nameless Afghans who laid down their lives and sacrificed their future.
To President Ghani and CEO Dr. Abdullah for their vision and statesmanship that can only come from great patriots.
So, I stand here, on behalf of 1.25 billion friends in India, in admiration for your achievements, in gratitude for your friendship and in solidarity for your future.
And, today, I am humbled and honoured to join President Ghani and all the Members of the Afghan Parliament to dedicate this new abode of democracy to the Afghan nation.
We could not have chosen a more special day than the birthday of one of the tallest leaders of our time, former Prime Minister and Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji.
Eleven years ago, he dreamt of this project in partnership with Karzai Saheb.
And, we are deeply touched that you have chosen to name one of the wings in this building the Atal Block.
It captures the spirit of Afghanistan and of our friendship.
This Parliament Complex is a small tribute to your progress as a nation and a democracy.
And, it will stand as an enduring symbol of the ties of emotions and values, of affection and aspirations that bind us in a special relationship.
Honourable Members,
Our ties are as ancient as history.
Over the mighty Hindu Kush and through the forbidding Khyber Pass, monks, merchants and monarchs have linked us through knowledge, culture, religion,commerce and kingdoms.
In the shifting contours of history, there were times we have been one.
There were times we saw wars.
But, through the ages, we have always enriched one another.
In the timeless Buddhist symbols of Aynak and Bamian and in the majestic monuments of Delhi, in our culture and art, in language and literature, food and festivals, we see the imprint of our timeless relations.
We owe to ancient Afghanistan the gift of one of the great characters of Mahabharata, Gandhari.
In the achievements of Mauryan Empire or Shershah Suri, we see connectivity that we now aspire to rebuild.
But, in the heart of every Indian and Afghan, there is boundless love for each other.
We love each other’s culture and cinema, music and poetry, food and festivals.
And, now we admire each other’s cricket.
We are delighted that the Afghan National Cricket Team has found its home ground near Delhi and is practicing for next year’s World Cup.
And, i congratulatethe Afghan Under 19 team that just beat Zimbabwe in its first home series.
We are just as proud that Afghans see India as a natural destination for education, health or a family home.
King Amanullah once told the Maharaja that so long as India was not free, Afghanistan was not free in the right sense.
This is the spirit of brotherhood between us.
And, when you began a new journey in a new century, we were proud to stand with you and walk with you.
Together, we have built roads that have brought regions closer;
power transmission lines and power stations that light up Afghan homes;
satellite links that bring education, medical advice and communication to Afghan people.
And, we are helping the security forces become more mobile.
Nothing is more important for a nation than its human resources.
Power and water will flow out of Salma Dam soon.
The Stor Palace will again stand as a symbol of your priceless heritage.
Our scheme of 1000 scholarships every year for Afghan students in India will continue.
We are pleased with the response to our special scholarship scheme in agriculture science.
Today, I announce 500 scholarships for the children of the martyrs of Afghan security forces.
As we have stood with you in our efforts to rebuild your country, you have guarded and protected our people as your own.
We have faced daily threats, but we feel secure in your midst.
To every Afghan, who has risked or lost his life so that his Indian guest is safe, I convey the eternal gratefulness of India.
To Indian diplomats, officers, engineers and doctors, who serve here with pride, to the families of our Indian martyrs, I express the gratitude of Indians and Afghans.
There are some who did not want us to be here.
There were those who saw sinister designs in our presence here.
There are others who were uneasy at the strength of our partnership.
Some even tried to discourage us.
But, we are here because you have faith in us.
You never doubted the sincerity of our commitment and the strength of our friendship.
You know, as we do, that Indians and Afghans have always stood for each other, never against another.
You have been at the crossroads of history.
And, your history tells us that you will never let yourself become a theatre of competition; or serve the designs of others.
For you live by the creed extolled by poet Kushal Khan Khattak that Nation’s honor and nation’s fame on life they have a prior claim.
So, with your faith and at your pace, India will continue to build Afghan capacity for governance, security and development, so that you can build a future that Afghans so richly deserve.
We will do this from the responsibility that comes from our friendship.
But, we also do this with a commitment to peace and stability in our region.
We know that Afghanistan’s success will require the cooperation and support of each of its neighbours.
And, all of us in the region – India, Pakistan, Iran and others – must unite, in trust and cooperation, behind this common purpose and in recognition of our common destiny.
When Afghanistan becomes a haven of peace and a hub for the flow of ideas, commerce, energy and investments in the region, we will all prosper together.
That is why we are working to improve your connectivity by land and sea, including through Chahbahar in Iran.
That is why I hope that Pakistan will become a bridge between South Asia and Afghanistan and beyond.
For, the fire that is lit in Afghanistan, can never be contained, within these boundaries.
Afghans have the wisdom to seek peace with neighbours, but also the courage to defend their freedom.
And, Afghans of all persuasions must have the right to seek peace among themselves.
Too much blood has flown down Kabul River.
Too many tragedies have darkened the mountain slopes.
Too many dreams have burnt in the fire of a senseless conflict.
But, it is now time for Afghans to come together in peace.
As a wise Afghan said, A tree with a bitter seed, Fed with butter and sugar, Will still bear a bitter fruit.
You have a glorious tradition of pluralism and respect for diversity and beliefs.
Those waging war from outside must seek a path to this building and this hall.
Those seeking territory through gun must seek power through ballot.
Those who have destroyed homes must now rebuild their nation.
And, it must be on your terms, on your genius, through your own process and your own spirit of brotherhood.
Not driven by the calculations or ambitions of others.
And, the future you build in peace and through dialogue must preserve the hard-won progress of the last decade and half.
It must have a place for every Afghan.
It must have space for everyone’s aspiration.
And, it must be a nation, where every citizen is secure of her rights and confident about her future.
And, as Afghans take responsibility for their future, the world must stand with them in solidarity and support.
It is time for all Afghans, everyone in the region and the rest of the world to come together.
The sacrifices must not go in vain.
The flame of hope should not die.
No girl that steps into the world should slip into darkness of denied opportunities.
No son should face the choice of gun or refuge in a distant land.
No mother should fear bringing a child into this world.
No leader should lose a brother because he spoke for Afghan freedom to choose friends.
No one kneeling in prayer in a mosque should be killed in the name of religion.
No elder should look back on his youth wasted in conflict, and see the same future for his grandchild.
For India, this is a deeply held commitment.
Your suffering is our pain.
Your dreams are our duty.

I am happy to note that Assam is ranked first among the North Eastern States in the Ease of Doing Business report.
I am sure that with the present leadership of the State Government, Assam is going to further improve its current position to emerge as one of the most sought after states for industrial investment in the country.
Our target is to re-develop 600 major Railway Stations in coming years.
Once again I congratulate the people of Assam and North East for holding such a big event with great fervour.
I also express my thanks to the participating dignitaries present from across the ASEAN and BBIN countries in the Global Investor Summit.

I am really happy to address the India-Singapore Economic Convention.
My visit has been very productive and positive.
I had excellent meetings with Singapore leaders today morning.
We have concluded the Strategic Partnership which takes the relationship to a new level of engagement.
We have set a high level of ambition for this relationship.
Friends! our historical ties and cultural proximity are our assets.
A large Indian Diaspora is enriching the life and work environment of Singapore.
In recent years, economic engagement has been a key driver of our relationship.
Singapore is our 10th largest trade partner globally.
It is also the 2nd largest in ASEAN.
Bilateral trade has expanded manifold after the conclusion of Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement in 2005.
Singapore has emerged as the 2nd largest source of FDI into India.
Outward Indian FDI to Singapore has also increased in recent times.
Singapore is now one of the top destinations for Indian investments.
A significantly large number of Indian companies are registered in Singapore.
Singapore companies also have a level of familiarity with Indian market due to involvement over the past few decades.
Our companies are positioned to explore and develop promising engagements.
With the significant and growing number of companies of both sides and of foreign companies in both markets, I expect even more exciting partnerships.
• You have the habit of precision; India has the scope for expansion;
• You are fond of going vertical; India’s development is both vertical and horizontal;
• You are an exciting incubator; India is a vast laboratory;
Thus, Singapore and India can work together in many promising areas.
Last month, I had the opportunity of laying the foundation of two projects in India with participation of Singapore.
One is the new capital city of Andhra Pradesh–Amaravati.
Singapore is involved in preparation of the Master Plan for this new city.
We are also exploring collaboration with Changi Airport to operate two Indian airports.
These are recent examples of the deepening of our economic partnership.
Singapore is also an important and valuable friend of India in our global outlook.
We regard Singapore as an essential ally in the implementation of our Look and Act East Policy.
I am fully aware of the important role Singapore has played in the implementation of this policy.
I look forward to working with Singapore in a bigger way.
Beyond the bilateral scope, there are also significant opportunities through collaboration with third countries.
One example is the ASEAN Economic Community which has come into effect.
It is going to create a 2 trillion US Dollar market of 600 million people.
It will further enable our businesses to jointly explore opportunities in the wider South East Asian region.
The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), comprising ASEAN and its six Dialogue Partners, is another potential opportunity for our companies.
Recently, in the India Africa Forum Summit held in New Delhi, Singapore was a special invitee.
This is recognition of another dimension of India-Singapore togetherness.
We can work jointly in the African countries.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
India is undergoing economic and social transformation on a scale and a speed that is unmatched in history.
Our growth rate was 7.3% in the last year.
World Bank has projected even better growth this year.
Indian economy is the fastest growing economy among major countries.
We are also working hard that the benefits of this growth reaches to the common man.
We have launched major schemes on financial inclusion.
Our strategy is to:
• Empower the people.
• Fund the un-funded.
• Secure the poor.
• And enhance the income level of all.
Money must reach the Marginalized.
With this objective, we opened 190 million new bank accounts.
Through them, we are trying to ensure direct transfer of benefits to the poor.
This targeting is also bringing discipline in Government expenditure.
We have also launched new insurance and pension schemes.
Through a new Bank, called MUDRA, we are funding the small traders and businessmen.
We have set time bound goals for providing access to housing, water, electricity and sanitation for all.
Thus, India is now the next frontier of economic revolution.
Our changing paradigm has created new opportunities for global investor community.
These opportunities range from building 50 million affordable houses to setting up 100 smart cities; modernization of railway network and re-development of our railway stations to setting up new railway corridors; generation of 175 GW of renewable energy to transmission and distribution networks.
Construction of National Highways, bridges, and Metro rail networks.
Such a huge potential for creation of infrastructure and production of goods will not be available in any other country.
More importantly, no one place on the earth can offer the customer base on such a massive scale.
We are trying to harness this development potential through our policies and people.
The campaigns like Digital India and Skill India are designed to prepare the people to take part in this process.
We have witnessed massive growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past.
Some of these have begun to challenge established global players.
In past few months, the interest of foreign investors in India has gone up tremendously.
However, there were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on their sentiments.
We have taken very decisive steps to remove many of long the pending concerns.
To give you some examples:-
• We have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance;
• We have greatly liberalised the licencing regime;
• We have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years;
• We have taken almost 60% of the defence items out of the licensing process and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate for the exports;
• We have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation;
• and we demonstrated this position in a number of ways;
• We have introduced the concept of composite sector caps for the FPIs and other foreign investors.
• We have notified the regulations for the Alternative Investment Funds and;
• We have rationalized the capital gains tax regime for Real Estate Investment Trusts;
• We have modified the Permanent Establishment norms;
• A new bankruptcy code and a new IPR policy is being drafted;
• The Company Law Tribunal is going to be formed soon.
• Our system for transparent auction and allocation of key natural resources like coal, spectrum, and iron ore has now become stable.
We are working hard to make sure that our tax regime is transparent and predictable.
We are also keen to see that genuine investors and honest tax payers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters.
To this objective we have already made a number of corrections.
As a result of our initiatives:-
• The sentiments for inflow of foreign investment are turning into commitments;
• FDI inflows have gone up by 40% compared with previous year’s corresponding period.
• Perceptions are turning into positive outcome:-
• We have jumped 12 ranks in the latest ranking by the World Bank on ease of doing business.
• India has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several agencies and institutions.
• India has also jumped 16 places on the World Economic Forum’s global competitive index.
• MOODY’s have upgraded the rating of India as positive.
Thus, just in eighteen months, we have successfully restored the credibility of India in the eyes of global players.
As soon as my government took over, we started liberalizing the FDI regime alongwith other reforms.
We are also conscious of the last mile operational issues in such policies.
In that spirit, we are finetuning the procedures also.
Early this month, we have taken very dynamic steps to further open up the economy for FDI.
With this last round of reforms:-
• India is among the most open economies for FDI.
• Some new sectors have been fully opened for FDI.
• For most of the sectors, FDI clearances are now on automatic route.
• In addition to Greenfield areas, many sectors can freely absorb FDI in Brownfield projects.
This includes Roads, construction and medical devices.
• Entry and exit conditions have been greatly relaxed for FDI.
We are keen to scale up investments in next generation infrastructure including digital networks and clean energy.
In addition to the core infrastructure, we are keen to invest in our social, industrial and agri-infrastructure to give better income and quality of life to our people.
With tight control over expenditure, we have greatly increased capital investment by the public sector.
To leverage this, we are setting up National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
We are also coming up with Tax Free Infrastructure Bonds with a view to broaden the corporate bond market.
This will also provide long term finance for infrastructure.
For infrastructure, we have also decided to launch Rupee Bonds in some countries.
Singapore could be among them.
We are quite eager to work with Singapore in this regard.
About 800 million people in India are below the age of 35 years.
Their aspirations, energy, enterprise and skills will be the force for India’s economic transformation.
But the immediate challenge is to productively employ the youth.
For meeting this challenge, we need to provide a huge push to manufacturing which has stagnated at around 16% of the GDP for several decades.
This share must reach around 25% in the short and medium term.
With this in view, we have launched the “Make in India” initiative.
We are working on all fronts to make India a global manufacturing hub.
We are creating the global skill pool to establish a modern economy with a world class manufacturing sector.
To achieve these objectives, apart from vigorous exercise for ease of doing business, we have fast tracked approvals and clearances for industry and infrastructure.
The hall mark of our strategy is Good Governance which is Participative and Policy Driven.
Through PPP, we are encouraging private investments in areas where earlier only government used to invest.
We are also divesting our stake in the public sector enterprises, to instill market discipline.
We are consistently working to integrate our economy with the rest of the world.
I hope to further dedicate the next three months to address even the remotest issues affecting free flow of capital and business to India.
It is for them that we want investments.
Our faster growth will transform lives of one sixth of global community.
The second commitment is towards our climate, our planet, our Nature.
Our commitment to mitigate the dangers of climate change do not arise from Economics or Politics.
They also do not arise from Fear or Favour.
They arise from our fundamental belief that nature is our Mother.
It is an article of faith.
I assure the Global community that we will do more than required.
We will stretch ourselves to do more than what we can normally do.
Both these commitments generate a wave of economic opportunities and activities which cannot be matched by any other country.
They also open up enormous opportunities for investors.
To sum up; I would like to say that In the last eighteen months,
• Reforms are happening in a big way.
They are now reaching to the last mile;
• Reform is to Transform the systems so that they Perform;
• Simply put, they aim at enabling the people to realise their potentials and dreams;
• Putting even more simply, it means more charm on the faces and less forms in offices;
• In addition, new frontiers and Deeper Foundations for financial markets have been laid;
• All together, Runways for take –off of the economy have been made.
Recently, the IMF chief has said that India is a bright spot in the Global economy.
I have also come to assure you that I am there to carefully hold your hands.

President of Institute of Company Secretaries of India, Dr. Shyam Agrawal Ji and other dignitaries present on this occasion.
ICSI is celebrating its 50th anniversary today.
My heartfelt greetings to all those associated with the institution on this occasion.
It has been a privilege for me to be amongst the people who have been a part of this journey of the ICSI over the past 49 years and felicitate them.
The motto of your institute is Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara .
It implies that one should speak he truth and follow rules and regulation.
Your advice- right or wrong has an impact on the corporate Governance of the country..
Friends, on several occasions, it has been seen that the people do not tread the path which they ought to have done.
In Mahabharata, Duyordhan has been quoted as saying: Janami Dharmam Na Cha Mei Pravittih, Janami Adharmam Na Cha Mei Nivrittih.
Your institution reminds such people of the values from this lesson of Satyam Vada, Dharmam Chara.
Your institution plays an important role in institutionalizing the transparency and honesty in the country.
Brothers and sisters, Acharya Chanakya had said:
Dahya Manen Vanhi Na;
It means, ‘Even if a single dry tree in the forest catches fire, the entire forest is engulfed in the fire.
In the same way, even if one member of the family does wrong, the reputation of the entire family is at stake’
A handful of people in our country have been engaged in harming its reputation, they have been trying to weaken our honest social fabric.
The Government has launched a campaign to clean-up the system and the institutions from such elements once it assumed office.
Under this campaign immediately after the formation of the government, a Special Investigation Team – SIT, has been set up by the Cabinet in its first decision.
It was suggested by the Supreme Court several years ago.
-Black Money Act was put in place to tackle the black money stashed abroad.
– Insolvency and Bankruptcy Codes were enacted.
– Benami Property Law that had been lying in limbo for 28 years, was implemented.
– Good And Simple Tax- GST – that was stuck up for several years was put in place.
– This is the government that has shown the courage to take the decision of Demonetization.
Brothers and sisters, This government has worked to strengthen the institutional probity in the country.
As a result of relentless hard work by this government alone, we are having a less cash economy.
9th November, 2016 will be remembered as the opening day of corruption free movement in the history of India.
The cash to GDP ratio has come down to 9 per cent after Demonetization.
It used to be above 12 per cent before 8th November 2016.
Friends, There was another character, Shalya in the Mahabharata.
Shalya was charioteer of Karna.
On the other hand, Krishna was the Sarathi of Arjuna.
This character, Shalya always used to discourage those who were in the battle field and spread despair.
He used to say, you don’t have the courage, your horses and chariot are weak and how would you fight.
Shalya belonged to the Mahabharata era.
But still we have some people having the same Shalya mentality.
Such people take pleasure in spreading the despair.
Some people take pleasure is spreading pessimism.
They get a good sleep out of it.
Friends, When the data suits their thinking, the institutions and processes appear correct to them.
However, the moment, the same data is unsuitable for them, they immediately start questioning the institutions and its processes.
No it’s not.
Nation’s economy has seen those quarters when the growth rate slipped down to 0.2 per cent, 1.5 per cent.
That kind of slowdown was even more harmful for the economy since during those years India was also struggling with higher Inflation, higher Current Account Deficit and higher Fiscal Deficit.
If you look at the two preceding years before 2014 such as 2012-13 and 2013-14, the average growth rate was around 6%.
Because, it won’t take much time for people with Shalya mentality to contest it.
These people said that they were not able to feel that economy was indeed growing at that rate.
It means that it does not fit into their Shalya mentality.
But the moment, GDP growth rate came down to 5.7% , it lifted their spirit.
They began telling, the institutions are correct.
Same set of people used to state that they are not feeling it.
Economy growing at a fast pace, was not acceptable to the.
However, today when so much of discussion is taking place about the economy, I would like to take you back in time.
Brothers and sisters, there was a time when India was included in a group related to international economy called Fragile Five, unlike the groups today like, G-7, G-8 or G-20.
Fragile Five group was considered a dangerous group as not only their own economy was in shambles but they were also considered as a stumbling block in the recovery of global economy.
India was named as a member of the same group.
What it meant was that we can’t manage our economy rather become a problem for others and India was tagged along with Fragile Five group.
At that time, these parameters which reverse the growth trajectory of the nation were the favourite of a handful of people.
Now when the same parameters have shown marked improvements, development is in the right direction, a handful of people are still having a look at it with their colored vision.
I am also showing you the slides.
Can you compare 10% with 2.5%.
Current Account Deficit which was 4% has come down to nearly 1%.
You can see it.
While improving upon the parameters, the Central Government has brought down the fiscal deficit from 4.5% under the previous regime to 3.5%.
India’’s Foreign Exchange Reserve has gone up by 25% from around $30,000 crore to $40,000 crore.
The financial stability of the country will be maintained.
We would take every step to bring in more investments. and carry forward the momentum of growth.
According to Reserve Bank today, the estimates from the next quarter are expected to show a rise in the growth of economy which may reach eventually to 7.7%.
Government is alert to reach out to and if needed to provide assistance to any sector following the structural reforms sector.
It can be MSME or export sector or a part of our non-formal economy.
I would like to reiterate from this forum that in the changing scenario, honesty will command a premium and the Government will protect the interest of honest persons.
I know that there is an element of apprehension among some of the traders who have joined the mainstream that whether their old records would be tracked seeing their new businesses.
Let me assure you that any such thing is not going to happen.
There can’t be a greater sin than stopping you from joining the mainstream.
And hence, our Government is of the view that we welcome those who wish to join the mainstream.
Please leave aside the old thinking.
It has been three months since it has been implemented.
We have seen closely what is working and what is not.
I assure traders that we are not orthodox and conservative.
We also don’t know everything.
But if something needs to be done, we shall do it.
We do not claim that we know everything.
However, this is an effort to move in the right direction.
Wherever there are obstacles, we shall try to overcome them based on our experience over the past three years and usher in reforms as and when required.
Friends, while discussing the state of economy with you, I would like to share the following details.
I leave it to you to judge the implications of these details.
Friends, I have a firm belief that whenever you bought a new car, you won’t have purchased it under compulsion.
You must have seen your household budget, the cost of educating your children, the expenditure over medical treatment of the elderly in the family.
And then when you have the saving, you would have thought of buying a house or a car.
This is the basic thinking of our society.
In such a situation-
-What will be you take if the Sale of passenger cars in the country has grown by nearly 12% after June ?
– What would you say when you find that the sale of commercial vehicles too has registered a growth of more than 23% after June?
– What would you say when the sale of two wheelers in the country has registered a growth of over 14%?
-What will you say when the number of domestic air travelers has registered an increase of 14% over the past two months?
– What will you say when international air freight traffic has registered a growth of nearly 16%?
-What would you like to say when the number of telephone subscribers has registered a growth of over 14%?
-Brothers and sisters, these developments indicate that people are buying vehicles, new phone connections and using air travel.
These indicators reflect the growth in demand in urban areas.
· Hence, if we look at indicators related to rural demand then the sale of tractors has registered a growth of over 34% in the recent months.
· Even in the FMCG sector, the trend of growth in demand is on the upside in the month of September.
-Friends, these things happen when the confidence among the people of the country grows up.
When people of the country feel this thing: yes, the economy is strong.
– The recently released PMI Manufacturing Index reflects the expansive mode.
And Future Output Index has crossed the figure of 60.
·-If we have a look at the recently released data, the production of coal, electricity, steel and natural gas has registered a robust growth.
·-Friends, even the disbursal of personal loan has registered rapid growth.
· The loans given by Housing Finance Companies and Non-Banking Finance Companies have registered significant growth.
-· Not only this, there is more investment in the mutual funds and insurance sector in the capital market.
During the entire period of last year this figure was Rs. 29000 crore.
· In less than four months, more than 45,000 crore rupees have been invested in Non-Financial Entities through corporate bonds and private placement.
-This data reflects the broad base of financing in the country.
It means that financing in India is no longer confined to bank loans alone.
-Friends, This government has continuously emphasized on the proper utilization of both time and resources.
One can see a clear difference in the pace of work during the three years of the previous government and this government.
· 80 thousand kilometers long rural roads were constructed during the last three years of the previous government.
During the three years of our government, 1 lakh 20 thousand kilometers long rural roads have been constructed.
It means a growth of 50% in the construction of rural roads.
-The previous Government during its last three years, had awarded the work to construct 15,000 kilometers long national highways.
Our government has awarded the work to construct 34,000 kilometers long national highways in its three years.
·If you talk about the investment in this sector, then the previous government has spent Rs. 93,000 crore during the last three years of its tenure in land acquisition and on construction of the roads.
This figure has gone up to Rs. 1.83 lakh crores in this government.
It means this government has nearly doubled the investment.
Similarly, if we talk about the railway sector:
· Nearly 1,100 kilometer long new rail lines were laid during the last three years of the previous government.
In the three years of this government this figure has crossed 2100 kilometers mark.
It means that we have laid the new railway lines almost twice as fast.
·During the last three years of the previous government, 1300 kilometer long railway tracks were converted in the double line.
During the three years of this government, 2600 kilometer long railway track has been converted in the double line.
It means that we have carried out the work of doubling of railway tracks twice as fast.
Friends, capital expenditure worth Rs. 1.49 lakh crore was made during the last three years of the previous government.
During the three years of this government, this figure has gone up to Rs. 2.64 lakh crore.
It means a growth of over 75%.
Now if I talk about the development of Renewable Energy sector, then:
·A total of 12,000 megawatt renewable energy capacity was added during the last three years of the previous government.
It means that this government’s performance in this sector is nearly two times better.
·During the last three years of the previous government, it spent nearly Rs. 4,000 on the renewable energy.
Our government has spent more than Rs. 10,600 crores in this sector in the three years.
Friends, The government has been paying full attention for strengthening the social infrastructure of the country along with the strengthening of physical infrastructure related to important sectors like rail-road and electricity.
We have taken major policy decisions and carried out financial reforms in the field of affordable housing which are unprecedented for the sector.
While this government has cleared projects worth Rs. 1.53 lakh crores during its first three years.
Brothers and sisters, More capital investment is required for this kind of developmental work that is taking place across the country.
-You might be aware that when the issue of reforms in the insurance sector was first discussed, the newspaper headlines used to say that if such a thing happens, it would be a major economic decision.
It was during the previous government.
That government completed its term without bringing reforms in the insurance sector.
We have brought in the reforms in the insurance sector.
It happened during this government.
-I would like to tell those people who have made this word – Reform – their theme song that we have carried out 87 small and big reforms in 21 sectors.
Big changes have been brought about in the investment policies related to several sectors including construction sector, defence sector, financial services, food processing , or other sectors you name it.
If you compare the total amount of foreign investment in India that has come after the liberalization and the foreign investment made during the last three years, you will realize the impact of economic reforms carried out by our government.
Brothers and sisters, you are from this field.
However, the statistics which I am placing before you will leave you surprised.
The liberalization time frame began after 1992.
If I take it as the basis, let us compare what has been the impact from liberalization till 2014 and then from 2014 to 2017.
· 75% of the total foreign investment in the construction sector has come in the last three years alone.
· Even in the civil aviation sector, 69% of the total foreign investment has come in these last three years.
· 56% of the total foreign investment in the mining sector has come in the last three years alone.
· 53% of the total foreign investment in the computer software and hardware sector has come in the last three years alone.
· 52% of the total foreign investment in the electrical equipments has come in during the three years of this government.
· 49% of the total foreign investment in the renewable energy sector has come in during the three years of this government.
· 45% of the total foreign investment in the textile sector has come in the last three years alone.
How did it happen?
But Shalya mentality goes on.
Friends, this government realizes the value of every single penny earned by your hard work.
That is why, the government’s policies and schemes are formulated in a manner that they help in not only making the lives of poor and middle class people easier, but should also help them in saving the money.
I can’t understand why the cost of LED bulb at that time was Rs.350.?.
This is a matter of research.
If we consider an average reduction of Rs. 250 in the price of a bulb, even then the middle class of the country has saved nearly Rs. 6,500 crores on this account.
These bulbs have reduced the electricity consumption in every household.
It has resulted in the estimated savings worth Rs. 14,000 crores to the middle class families in just one year.
This, in itself is empowering the middle class families.
·Due to the efforts made by the government, those local bodies are also reaping the financial benefits.
As per an estimate, the municipality of a tier-two town has made on an average saving Rs. 10-15 crore.
– For the first time, the middle class has been given relief on the interest rates for construction of houses by this Government.
You might recall, never before middle class was granted relief for construction of houses.
We have been pro active I this direction.
I am aware that sometimes I’ll have to face criticism for empowering the people and the country instead of handing out doles.
However, I cannot compromise with the future of the country to protect my present.
Do we need to worry only about the power and the vote.?
We have chosen the path which is difficult.
However we are treading the right path keeping in mind the welfare of the people.
I have to often face criticism for this reason.
The vested interests feel aggrieved since my Government believes in transferring the money into the accounts of the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit transfer.
It has ensured that ghost accounts are done away with.
That is why such people won’t like PM Modi .
That is why our emphasis is on empowering the common man.
I would like to tell my fellow citizens humbly that I cannot compromise with the future of the country to protect my present.
Friends, This government has laid emphasis on the personal sector along with the private sector and public sector.
Otherwise, the discourse was confined only to the private and the public sector.
Personal Sector, which is connected to the personal aspirations of the people is equally important.
That is why this government is extending every possible help to the youth who want to do something on their own, who want to fulfill their dreams.
· Loans of more than Rs. 3.75 lakh crore have been given to more than 9 crore account holders without any bank guarantee under the Mudra scheme.
The government has been encouraging the self employment through the schemes like Skill India Mission, Stand-up India and Start-up India.
Companies have been given financial incentives for bringing more and more people in the formal economy.
Brothers and sisters, If we take a look at some of the indicators related to formal sector employment, then:
-By the end of March 2014, there were 3.26 crore employees who have been actively contributing the provident fund money into the Employees Provident Fund Organization every month.
In the last three years, this number has gone up to 4.80 crore.
Some people forget this thing that this number cannot go up without growth in employment.
Friends, We have taken steps to ensure that the Government schemes bring in a qualitative change in the lives of poor people, lower middle class and middle class people.
Bank accounts of more than 30 crore poor people have been opened under the Jan-Dhan scheme.
More than three crore women have been provided a gas connection free of cost under the Ujjwala scheme.
Nearly 15 crore poor people have been brought under the coverage of government insurance schemes.
The Saubhagya Scheme has been launched a few days ago to provide free electricity connections to the poor people.
These schemes have been empowering the poor people.
However, it is corruption and black money which have been a bane for the nation.
Your institution and the company secretaries of the country have an important role in curbing the black money and corruption.
Registration of 2.1 lakh companies of the total 3 lakh shell companies, which were suspected of channelizing the black money following the note ban, have been cancelled.
I am hopeful that the level of awareness among the directors will be increased and companies will become more transparent following this cleansing operation against the shell companies.
Friends, This period is of immense changes, of transformative changes in the history of the nation.
The importance of a transparent and honest administration is now understood in the country.
Now it is the need of the hour for you all to play an active role in producing a new business culture.
Be it a small trader or a big trader, he should adopt the honest tax system inbuilt in the GST.
It is also your duty to encourage the business community in this regard.
Lakhs of students have been enrolled with your institution.
Can your institution take this responsibility that it will train one lakh youth about small-small things related to GST?
It will open up a new avenue of employment.
If it is taken up in organized way, even one lakh would be small number.
Friends, nation celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022.
We must have a dream to fulfill the aspirations and wishes of our freedom fighters and great leaders who spent their prime of life in jails, struggled for independence throughout their life and sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the country.
Every Indian citizen should have the dream like the one in 1942 during Quit India Movement, when people decided that they won’t stop till Britishers leave India.
We should also move ahead with a dream for 2022, in75 th year of our independence.
· Can you take the responsibility of making the country a high tax compliant society by 2022?
· Can you ensure that there will not be a single shell company in the country by 2022?
· Can you ensure that by 2022 every company in the country will honestly pay the taxes?
· Can you establish an honest business culture in the country by 2022 by expanding the scope of your help?
I hope that in the beginning of its golden jubilee year, the ICSI will embark on a journey to meet these goals with guidelines and will also include them in its work culture.
Once again, Congratulations to you all in this Golden Jubilee Year.
I would like to assure my fellow citizens that we do not take offence to the recent spate of criticisms of the Government on the economic front.
The Government is sensitive towards the concerns of the people.
We take even the harshest criticism in our stride.
We would strive to carry forward the nation of 1.25 billion on the road to growth and development with humility, and keeping in mind the interests of the people with the same rhythm and fast pace.
I would also like to tell our critiques humbly that we do not subscribe to the view that all the critiques are wrong.
However, we should desist from creating an atmosphere of pessimism in the country.
I showed you the glimpses of a parameter which reflects the strength of our economy.
There are many other parameters which prove how strong is our economy and a clear reflection of the decision making powers of the Government.
This is the proof of the direction and momentum of the Government.
The economic strength is also reflected in the rising confidence about India both inside the country and abroad.
We should not ignore it.
Let us march ahead for building a New India with a renewed vigour, zeal, confidence and culture.
Congratulations to you all on the Golden Jubilee.
Once again many- many greetings

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved India’s Membership for European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD)
Necessary steps will be initiated by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance to acquire the membership of the EBRD.
· Membership of EBRD would enhance India’s international profile and promote its economic interests.
Access to EBRD’s Countries of Operation and sector knowledge.
· India’s investment opportunities would get a boost.
The membership would help India leverage the technical assistance and sectoral knowledge of the bank for the benefit of development of private sector.
· This would contribute to an improved investment climate in the country.
· This would open up new vistas for Indian professionals on the one hand, and give a fillip to Indian exports on the other.
· Increased economic activities would have the employment generating potential.
· It would also enable Indian nationals to get the employment opportunity in the Bank.
Financial Implications:-
The minimum initial investment towards the membership of EBRD will be approximately €1 (one) million.
However, this assumption is based on India deciding to buy the minimum number of shares (100) required for obtaining the membership.
If India were to buy a higher number of Bank shares, the financial implications could be higher.
In-principle approval of the Cabinet at this stage is being obtained for joining the Bank.
The issue relating to acquiring the membership of the “European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD)” had been under consideration of the Government.
With the country’s impressive economic growth over the years and enhanced international political profile, it was considered appropriate that India should expand its presence on the global developmental landscape beyond its association with the Multi-lateral Development Banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank.

If the State(s) fails to claim this amount before 30thNovember in the financial year, then, these funds will become a part of the common pool, which will be released to the high performing States, which have already pre-financed the requisite Government of India share on a first come first serve basis.

NRDWP is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with 50.50 fund sharing between the Centre and the States.
Over the years, learning from the success achieved and the deficiencies felt during the implementation of NRDWP, certain modifications are needed in existing guidelines and procedure of release of funds to the States for making the programme more outcome-oriented and competitive.

I have had various interactions with Indian diaspora across the globe during the last three and a half years or so.
I have felt an intense desire, to make a contribution to India.
Through this Institute, Romesh ji and Sunil ji have blended this desire with a futuristic vision of a prosperous and vibrant India.
In doing so, they have set an example that is worthy of emulation.
Friends, today India is one of the fastest growing economies of the world.
We are using technology in an un-paralleled way from agriculture to aeronautics and from space missions to service delivery.
We are also witnessing a wave of entrepreneurship ranging from small enterprises to big-ticket investments.
These are just a few indicators to show, how well-placed we are to fare in the upcoming fourth industrial revolution.
Friends, with the arrival of Artificial Intelligence, Bots and Robots there is no doubt that our productivity will further go up.
Such fears are neither un-founded nor new.
At every stage of technological evolution, we have faced such doubts and questions.
This leads to two views of the future.
Technology opens entirely new spheres and sectors for growth.
It also opens up an entirely new paradigm of opportunities.
With each wave of new technology, many new opportunities arise.
New opportunities have always out-numbered the lost ones.
The spirit of scientific enquiry was rooted in the pursuit of Truth.
Our ancient texts go on to further list the mental faculties that assist in this pursuit of the Truth. श्रद्धा (dedication),मेधा (mental capacity), मनीषा (intelligence), मनसा (mind), शान्ति (peace), चित्त (elevated state of consciousness), स्मृति (memory), स्मरण (recall) and विज्ञान (application of knowledge).
From this scientific enquiry this pursuit of the truth is to be obtained the ultimate creative bliss for the greater good of mankind.
It is our intention that will determine the outcomes of artificial intelligence.
With every industrial revolution, the scalability of technology has increased manifold.
This has given human increasingly more power to create an impact in whatever he does through technology.
It is this ethic of development that will ensure equity for all peoples.
The March of Technology cannot be at the expense of further increasing the difference between societies over access to technology.
The evolution of Technology has to be rooted in the ethic of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
Friends, Can we take the global lead on creating Artificial Intelligence that is less about making humans redundant and more about enhancing human abilities and expanding human capacities.
Can we make the future less about machines dis-placing humans to a future about humans becoming better humans by converting their weaknesses into their strengths for the greater good of mankind?
Friends, at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Human understanding is the solution of many problems we are facing.
We are such a diverse nation of tens of languages and hundreds of dialects.
Can we have intelligent Artificial Intelligence that makes communication and conversations across these languages and dialects easier?
Can Artificial Intelligence help us take quality healthcare to every corner of India by expanding capacities of our healthcare workers?
Can Artificial Intelligence help us predict natural calamities?
Can Artificial Intelligence help us detect serious health conditions before they manifest physically?
Can Artificial Intelligence help our farmers make the right decisions regarding weather, crop and sowing cycle?
Friends, our Government is of the firm belief, that we can use this power of twenty-first century technology to eradicate poverty and disease.
Under Bharat-Net, we are providing broad-band Internet connectivity to our villages.
This digital infrastructure provides the backbone for innovative IT solutions for service delivery, and innovative applications.
The Union Government’s National Skill Development Mission is also aimed to ensuring a rightly-skilled workforce, keeping in mind global job requirements of the next few decades.
We have also launched the Atal Innovation Mission to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship.
Its objective is to serve as a platform for promotion of world-class Innovation Hubs, Grand Challenges, Start-up businesses and other self-employment activities, particularly in technology driven areas.
The Atal Innovation Mission is establishing Atal Tinkering Laboratories in schools across India with a vision to encourage one million children in India to become young innovators.
I hope that India shall be in a unique position to show the entire world how Artificial Intelligence can be applied safely and responsibly for the benefit of the people.

Chairing the first meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog, the Prime Minister described this meeting as one which had the potential to bring about historic changes.
Noting that India cannot advance without all its states advancing in tandem, the Prime Minister said the idea was to bring up all states together in the spirit of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
He added that he envisioned different states competing with each other in promoting governance initiatives, in a spirit of “cooperative, competitive federalism.”
Therefore, he added, “first and foremost we should aim at a high rate of growth.”
The Prime Minister noted that projects are often held up for want of timely decisions, and a project can get stuck at any stage in any forum.
He requested the Chief Ministers to give personal attention to such factors which slow down projects.
He urged all Chief Ministers to focus on the cycle of Investment, growth, job creation and prosperity.
He also suggested that an officer be identified in the state governments to monitor and ensure a smooth resolution of the pending issues so as to expedite the project implementation.
The Prime Minister emphasized that the Centre wished to empower the states with finances, with technology and knowledge so that they are able to plan better and execute even better.
Shri Narendra Modi said that Cabinet Resolution setting up NITI Aayog provides for the appointment of Regional Councils with specific mandates for specific time periods.
He hoped that these councils could help forge cooperation among two or more states facing a common set of problems or amicably settle disputes that delay progress.
He said these councils could catalyse joint projects involving travel, transportation and tourism across member states.
The Prime Minister also expressed hope that through the mechanism of the NITI Aayog, India could move away from “one size fits all” schemes, and forge a better match between the schemes and the needs of the states.
He said that for federalism to work well, states must also fulfill their role in promoting the shared national objectives.
Reflecting on the role of NITI Aayog as a think-tank, the Prime Minister said he sees great scope for states to learn from each other, work together among themselves and with the Centre.
The Prime Minister noted that in the last two and a half decades, the Indian economy has been transforming itself from a planned to a market economy.

Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam, a voice of influence in the world of finance,Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director of Monetary Authority of Singapore, a leading institution in fintech,Tens of thousands of participants from over one hundred countries,
It is a great honour to be the first Head of Government to deliver the keynote address at Singapore Fintech Festival.
This is a tribute to the youth of India with its eyes firmly fixed to the future.
It is an acknowledgement of the financial revolution sweeping through India and transforming the lives of 1.3 billion people.
This is an event of finance and technology and, it is also a festival.
It is celebrated all over the world as a victory of virtue, hope, knowledge and prosperity.
The Diwali lights are still on in Singapore.
The Fintech Festival is also a celebration of belief.
Belief in the spirit of innovation and the power of imagination.
Belief in the energy of youth and their passion for change.
Belief in making the world a better place.
And, it is no surprise that in just its third year, this Festival is already the world’s largest.
Singapore has been a global hub for finance and, it is now taking a leap into the digital future of finance.
It was here, in June this year, that I launched India’s RuPay card and the first international remittance mobile app using India’s world class Unified Payment Interface or UPI.
I have heard of an advice going around in start-up circles.
● To increase your Venture Capital or VC funding by 10 percent, tell the investors you run a “platform”, not a regular business.
● If you want to increase your VC funding by 20 percent, tell the investors that you are operating in the “fintech space”.
● But, if you really want the investors to empty their pockets, tell them that you are using “blockchain” .
It tells you of the excitement and promise of emerging technologies to transform the world of finance.
Indeed, history has shown that finance is often the first to embrace new technology and connectivity.
We are in an age of a historic transition brought about by technology.
From desktop to cloud, from internet to social media, from IT Services to Internet of Things,we have come a long way in a short time.
There is daily disruption in businesses.
The character of the global economy is changing.
Technology is defining competitiveness and power in the new world.
And, it is creating boundless opportunities to transform lives.
Across the world, that vision is rapidly changing into reality.
To begin with financial inclusion has become a reality for 1.3 billion Indians.
We have generated more than 1.2 billion biometric identities – called Aadhaar or foundation – in just a few years.
With our Jan DhanYojana, we aimed to give a bank account to every Indian.
More than Rupees 3.6 lakh crore, or 50 billion dollars of benefits from government have reached the people directly.
No longer must a poor citizen in a remote village travel long distances or pay off middle-men to get her rights.
No longer can fake and duplicate accounts bleed government finances.
We have saved over Rupees 80,000 crore, or 12 billion dollars in prevented leakages.
A student can get her scholarship directly into her account.
No longer will she be lost in end-less paper chase.
Banking has come to doorsteps even in remote villages through 400,000 micro ATMs based on Aadhaar.
And now, this digital infrastructure has helped launch the world’s largest healthcare scheme this year.
‘Ayushman’ will provide affordable health insurance to 500 million Indians.
It has also helped us extend 145 million loans for small entrepreneurs through Mudra scheme.
In four years, they amount to Rupees 6.5 lakh crore, or 90 billion dollars.
Nearly 75 percent of these loans have gone to women.
Just a few weeks ago, we launched the India Post Payments Bank.
Over 150 thousand post offices across India and 300,000 postal service employees are using technology to provide house to house banking.
Of course financial inclusion also needs digital connectivity.
More than 120,000 village councils in India have already been connected by nearly 300,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables.
Over 300,000 Common Service Centres have brought digital access to villages.
They give our farmers better access to land records, credit, insurance, market and the best price.
They deliver health services and hygiene products to women.
For those with mobile and internet, the BHIM-UPI is the world’s most sophisticated, simpleand seamless platform for payments between accounts, using a virtual payment address.
From cards to QRs and wallets, digital transactions in India are growing rapidly.
Every month, the value of transaction is growing by over 30 percent.
But, more than the pace, I am inspired by the opportunities, efficiency, transparency and convenience that digital payment is generating.
A shopkeeper can go online to reduce his inventory and speed up collections.
For a fruit grower, a farmer or a rural artisan , the markets are direct and closer, earnings are higher,and payments are faster.
A worker collects wages or remits money home quickly without giving up a day’s work.
Every digital payment saves time.
It adds to a huge national saving.
It is increasing productivity of individuals and our economy.
It also helps improve tax collection and inject fairness in the economy.
Even more, digital payments are a gateway to a world of possibilities.
Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence are helping us build a whole range of value added services for people.This includes credit to those with little or no credit history.
Financial inclusion also extends to micro, small and medium enterprises.
They are all coming on the nation-wide Goods and Services Tax digital network, launched just over a year ago.
Banks are reaching out to them with credit.
Alternative lending platforms are offering innovative financing models.
They no longer have to look at informal markets for credit at high interest rates.
And, just this month, we committed to approve loans up to Rupees 1 crore, or one 150,000 dollars for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises within 59 minutes – without even visiting a bank.
This is driven by an algorithm that uses GST returns, Income Tax returns and bank statements to make credit decisions.
In just a few days, 150,000 such enterprises have come on board for loans.
This is the power of fintech to drive enterprise, employment and prosperity.
It is an integrated platform for purchases by government agencies.
It provides everything – search and comparison, tender, online ordering, contract generation and payment.
There is an explosion of fintech innovation and enterprise in India.
It has turned India into a leading fintech and Startup nation in the world.
The future of fintech and Industry 4.0 is emerging in India.
Our youth are developing apps that are making the dream of paperless, cashless, presence-less, and yet safe and secure, transactions possible for all.
That is the wonder of India Stack– simply the largest set of Application Programming Interface in the world.
They are using Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and machine learning to create solutions for banks, regulators and consumers.
And, they are also embracing our nation’s social missions – from health and education to micro credit and insurance.
Likewise, India’s vast market can enable fintech products to achieve scale, reduce risks and costs, and go global.
Across the world, from the Indo-Pacific to Africa to Latin America, we see inspiring stories of extraordinary innovation changing ordinary lives .
But, there is much to be done.
Our focus should be development of all, through , that is, development of the most marginalised.
We must bring the unbanked 1.7 billion people in the world into the formal financial market.
We must extend the security of insurance and pension to more than a billion workers in the informal sectors worldwide, who still do not have it.
We can use fintech to ensure that no dream remains unfulfilled, and no enterprise remains still born, because of lack of access to finance.
We must use fintech tools to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.
We must also ensure that the pace and the push of Fintech work to the advantage of the people, not to their disadvantage; that technology in finance ensures improvement of the human condition through direct contact with the most marginalized.
We also need to enhance awareness of the masses and educate them about the opportunities which inclusive policies and use of technology open up for them.
For this,fintech will need to be not merely a mechanism but a movement.
And, we have to address the inevitable questions of data ownership and flow, privacy and consent; private and public good; law and ethics.
Finally, we must invest in creating skills for the future.
And, be prepared to back ideas and invest for the long term.
This generation will shape the futurein the palm of every hand in the world.
At no time in history were we blessed with so many possibilities:
to make opportunities and prosperity a reality in a lifetime, for billions.
to make the world more humane and equal –between rich and poor, between cities and villages, between hopes and achievements.
Just as India will learn from others, we will share our experience and expertise with the world.
Because,what drives India also holds hope for others.
And,what we dream for India is what we also wish for the world.

The very word “Japan” in India is a benchmark of quality, excellence, honesty and integrity.
Even against a weak international economic scenario, the news from India is of strong growth and abundant opportunities.
It is of Incredible opportunities, and about India’s Credible Policies.
Today, every global company has an India strategy.
And, Japanese companies are no exception.
Japanese investments extend to both green-field and brown-field projects; manufacturing and services; infrastructure and insurance; and e-commerce and equity.
For this, we will be proactive in addressing your concerns.
And, we will further strengthen the special mechanisms including Japanese Industrial Townships.
The Social Security Agreement with Japan has also been implemented, which is good news for the growing number of professionals on both sides.
· We want to build roads and railways in a faster way;
· We want to explore minerals and hydrocarbons in a greener way;
· We want to build homes and civic amenities in a smarter way; and
· We want to produce energy in a cleaner way.
In addition, there are futuristic infrastructure projects of second generation.
These include: the Dedicated Freight Corridor, the Industrial Corridors, High Speed Railways, Smart Cities, Coastal Zones and Metro Rail projects.
We have successfully enacted a new legislation regarding Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code passed recently will make it easier for investors to have an exit.
I have long maintained that India needs scale, speed and skill.
Japan has a very important role to play in all three.
The captains of Japanese business and industry sitting here will agree with me that a combination of Japan’s technologies and India’s human resources will create a win-win situation.
Let us march forward and explore bigger potentials and brighter prospects.
India, today took another major step in the fight against tax evasion, “round tripping” and “base erosion/profit shifting”.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of an Agreement and the Protocol between the India and Cyprus for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income.
This step follows the recent amendment of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with Mauritius.
As in the case of Mauritius, the treaty with Cyprus had provided for residence-based taxation of capital gains.
In other words, India will have the right to tax capital gains arising in India.
The provisions in the earlier treaty for residence-based taxation were leading to distortion of financial and real investment flows by artificial diversion of various investments from their true countries of origin, for the sake of avoiding tax.
As in the case of Mauritius, this amendment will deter such activities.
Negotiations with Singapore are also underway for similar changes.
Your Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya; Cabinet Secretaries; Chairmen of various Chambers and associations of Commerce & Industry; Friends from the Business Community of Kenya and India;
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I am happy to be with you on my first visit to Kenya as Prime Minister.
Indians in general, and Gujaratis in particular, have had their second home in Kenya.
So, from that perspective, I am really late in visiting this great country.
There has been a long gap of nearly 35 years for the visit of Indian Prime Minister.
As Chief Minister of Gujarat, I visited Kenya in 2008.
We also received delegations in Gujarat from here.
Kenya’s economy and its infrastructure make it an influential player in the region.
India and Kenya have had a very special relationship.
We are also working on an ambitious renewable energy programme.
India and Kenya are blessed by sufficient solar radiation.
Solar energy is a real solution for global warming.
It is also a good strategy for providing electricity to remote villages and hamlets.
We look forward to work together on this front under the International Solar Alliance.
Similarly, health sector is another area of great interest to both sides.
We are happy that thousands of Kenyan patients have returned from India after a successful treatment.
I understand that Kenya would like to replicate the Indian experience in Medicare and become a medical hub in the region.
We would be happy to support you in this process.
These are just a few indicators of the depth of our relationship and the potentials for co-operation.
Like Kenya, India is also a young country.
Your workforce is sought after in Africa.
Similarly, the Indian work force is sought after in the entire world.
We can do a lot together to nurture and train this human capital which can serve the whole world.
Today, India is the fastest growing large economy of the world.
We are not only having a high growth rate; we are also going up in various global indicators.
• We have jumped 12 ranks in the latest global ranking on Ease of doing business by the World Bank. • India has also jumped 16 places on the World Economic Forum’s global competitive index.
India has changed a lot in last two years.
We are now the most preferred destination for FDI.
In the year of 2015, we have received highest ever FDI.
And for you the good news is that India is the largest trading partner of Kenya.
India is also the second largest investor here.
We will be happy to further remove the imbalance in trade between us.
We will also be happy to enhance the level of investment in Kenya.
I am here to assure the people and Government of Kenya that India stands by you.
Our friendship is only a win-win game.
Whether it is Kenyan students in India; or Indian professionals in Kenya- both should shine.
Whether it is mines, minerals or machines; all are rewarding areas.
We should jointly explore the opportunities.
Various initiatives during my visit including this meeting are indicators in that direction.
We have printed a guide book on Doing Business in Kenya.
This is for guiding the Indian Investors to invest here.
It is my pleasure to present the book to His Excellency the President of Kenya.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid tributes to Babu Jagjivan Ram on his death anniversary.

This visit is an occasion:
• to rejuvenate the bonds of our friendship;
• to compose a new chapter in our ties; and
• to jointly venture towards new horizons of engagement.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have had productive discussions covering an extensive menu of issues.
Israel is among the leading nations in the field of innovation, water and agricultural technology.
These are also among my priority areas in India’s development.
We are of one view that together our scientists and researchers would develop, build and implement mutually beneficial solutions in the field.
Our decision to establish a bilateral Technology Innovation Fund worth US$ 40 million for research in industrial development will help us in achieving this goal.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I agreed on the need to do more in this direction.
Businesses on both sides should take primary lead in such efforts.
This would also be our message to the CEO Forum tomorrow.
India and Israel live in complex geographies.
We are aware of strategic threats to regional peace and stability.
India has suffered firsthand the violence and hatred spread by terror.
So has Israel.
We also discussed the situation in West Asia and wider region.
It is India’s hope that peace, dialogue, and restraint will prevail.
Our people hold natural affinity and warmth for each other.
The Indian-origin Jewish community reminds us of these bonds.
It also serves as a bridge to a shared future.
In recent years, we have been receiving a large number of Israeli tourists in India.
At the same time, more and more Indian students are choosing to pursue advance academics and research in your best universities.
Excellency Netanyahu,
It has been a productive and memorable twenty-four hours in Israel.
I am sure that the rest of my stay would be equally exciting.
I again thank you for your warm welcome and hospitality.

The global economy is changed, with new engines of growth, more widely dispersed economic power and widening wealth gap.
Trends in demography, urbanization and migrations are posing new challenges.
Climate change and terrorism are new concerns.
Cyber and Space are entirely new frontiers of opportunities and challenges.
Yet, our institutions, approaches, and often mindsets, reflect the wisdom of the century we have left behind, not the century we live in.
This is especially true of the United Nations Security Council.
The reform of the Security Council within a fixed time frame has become an urgent and important task.”
The Joint Statement issued at the end of the meeting stated: “The G-4 leaders stressed that a more representative, legitimate and effective Security Council is needed more than ever to address the global conflicts and crises, which had spiralled in recent years.

Delegation of leaders from J&K Opposition Parties meets PM
A delegation representing the film and entertainment industry, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Mumbai today.
The delegation comprised producers and CEOs of companies in the entertainment industry.
The aim is to work together to develop a mutually beneficial relationship in the best interests of members, students and the institutes.
Through such activities, substantial goodwill is expected to be generated for India, Indian citizens and Indian Chartered Accountants in the Sultanate of Oman.
It is also expected to lead to enhancement of remittances by Indian nationals to India.
Since Oman does not have a local professional accountancy Institute and it is the ICAI which has been collaborating with CBFS, Oman in matters relating to the profession.
As such, enhanced employment opportunities are expected to be created for Indian professionals in the Sultanate of Oman.
The ICAI is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament of India.
The Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, to regulate the profession of Chartered Accountancy in India.
Your Excellency, President Johann Schneider-Ammann,
Thank you, Excellency, for your warm remarks and generous welcome.
I feel the weight of history, standing here with you in this truly international city-Geneva.
And, not just international, but a city with a humanitarian soul.
After all, it is home to the “Red Cross”, and headquarters of several international organizations devoted to serving mankind.
India and Switzerland have both been the voices of peace, understanding and humanitarian values in the world.
Ties of collaboration in trade, investment, science and technology and skill development benefit both our societies.
India has affirmed it’s readiness to resume FTA talks with EFTA.
We are all aware of the strengths of the Swiss economy.
But, India too is undergoing profound transformations.
We are today the fastest growing economy in the world.
But, that alone is not enough.
I want the Indian economy to be driven by smart and sustainable cities, robust farm sector, vibrant manufacturing and dynamic service sector.
And, its engines to run on world class network of rail, roads, airports and digital connectivity.
Where a home for everyone, and electricity in every home is a reality.
And, its 500 million plus youth is skilled and ready to meet the global needs of manpower.
In tune with its objectives and India’s civilizational ethos an economically prosperous India will also be friendly to the planet and our environment.
Reliance on renewable energy, rather than on fossil fuels would be our guiding motto.
We see a perfect connect between our development needs and Swiss strengths.
I, therefore, invite the Swiss companies to avail of this great opportunity to be a key partner in India’s economic growth.
Ultimately, the economic prosperity of 1.25 billion plus would also benefit the entire world.
India and Switzerland also share a commitment to reform international institutions in line with current global realities.
We have both agreed to support each other for our respective bids for the non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
I am also thankful to the President for Switzerland’s understanding and support for India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Combating the menace of “black money” and tax evasion is also our shared priority.
We discussed the need for an early and expeditious exchange of information to bring to justice the tax offenders.
An early start to negotiations on the Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information would be important in this respect.
Strong ties between the people of our two countries are an important base and benchmark of our linkages.
Thanks to the Indian film industry, we are very familiar with the enchanting beauty of the Swiss landscapes.
There are many success stories of our relationship.
One that has been making waves in the Grand Slams of the tennis world is the partnership of famous Swiss player Martina Hingis with Sania Mirza and Leander Paes of India.
I am confident that our common commitments and values, people to people links and a strong and growing economic partnership will take our relations to new heights.
I thank you, Excellency, once again for hosting me in Geneva.

The MoU will provide an opportunity to the ICAI members to expand their professional horizon and simultaneously ICAI will become an entity to aid strengthen brand building of local nations.

The MoU would help encourage more and more young Indian Chartered Accountants to take up the recognition of “CPA Canada” professional designation to further help them pursue professional opportunities in Canada.
A number of Indian Chartered Accountants are holding top level positions in Canadian companies and with the recognition from CPA Canada, the Canadian Corporates would trust Indian talent and skills more and proceed to hire them.
Implementation strategy and Targets
The MoU will apply to members of good standing who have gained membership in the ICAI or one of the Canadian Provincial CPA bodies by meeting the education, examination and practical experience requirements of the ICAI or the Canadian Provincial CPA bodies respectively.

“CPA Canada” Institute is the national organization established to support a unified Canadian accounting profession.
Dear brothers and sisters,
I am personally pained at the developments.
Violence cannot provide a solution to any problem.
In a democracy, solutions are found through restraint and mutual dialogue.
This dispute can only be solved within the legal ambit.
Breaking the law is not a viable alternative.
The violence and arson seen in the last two days is only causing loss to the poor, and to our nation’s property.
Whenever the country has faced adverse circumstances, the people of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, just like people across the country, have always handled the situation with sensitivity.
I appeal to the people of the two States, to display sensitivity, and also keep in mind their civic responsibilities.
I trust you will keep national interest and nation building above all else, and give priority to restraint, harmony, and finding a solution, eschewing violence, destruction and arson.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the beneficiaries of various social security schemes from across the country, through video bridge.
This is the eighth interaction in the series by the Prime Minister through video conference with various beneficiaries of Government schemes.
Expressing happiness in interacting with people who fought adversities and emerged much stronger, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi said that Social security schemes empower people.
He added that these social security schemes of the present Government not only help people effectively deal with the uncertainties of life, but also empower them to rise over the financially difficult situations of the family.
Prime Minister outlined the various aspects pursued by the Government to ensure financial security for the poor and the vulnerable.
They are – opening the doors of the banks for the poor- banking the unbanked; ensuring access to capital for small business and budding entrepreneurs- funding the unfunded and; providing social security cover for the poor and vulnerable – financially securing the unsecured.
Interacting with beneficiaries Prime Minister said that the total number of 28 crore bank accounts opened under Pradhan MantriJan DhanYojana during the period 2014 – 2017 is nearly 55% of the total bank accounts opened in the world.
He also expressed happiness that more women have bank accounts in India now and that number of bank accounts in India has reached 80% from 53% in 2014.
Talking about the accidental insurance coverage scheme, Pradhan MantriSurakshaBima Yojana, Prime Minister said that more than 13 crore people have availed the scheme.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for introduction of the Payment of Gratuity (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the Parliament.
The Amendment will increase the maximum limit of gratuity of employees, in the private sector and in Public Sector Undertakings/ Autonomous Organizations under Government who are not covered under CCS (Pension) Rules, at par with Central Government employees.
The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 applies to establishments employing 10 or more persons.
The main purpose for enacting this Act is to provide social security to workmen after retirement, whether retirement is a result of the rules of superannuation, or physical disablement or impairment of vital part of the body.
Therefore, the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 is an important social security legislation to wage earning population in industries, factories and establishments.
The present upper ceiling on gratuity amount under the Act is Rs. 10 Lakh.
The provisions for Central Government employees under Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 with regard to gratuity are also similar.
Before implementation of 7th Central Pay Commission, the ceiling under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 was Rs. 10 Lakh.
However, with implementation of 7th Central Pay Commission, in case of Government servants, the ceiling now is Rs. 20 Lakhs effective from 1.1.2016.
Therefore, considering the inflation and wage increase even in case of employees engaged in private sector, the Government is of the view that the entitlement of gratuity should be revised for employees who are covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.
Accordingly, the Government initiated the process for amendment to Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts (Amendment) Bill, 2018 for introduction in the Parliament.
The Bill seeks to achieve the following objectives:
This would bring down the time taken (presently 1445 days) in resolution of commercial disputes of lesser value and thus further improve India’s ranking in the Ease of Doing Business.
The amendment provides for establishment of Commercial Courts at district Judge level for the territories over which respective High Courts have ordinary original civil jurisdiction i.e in the cities of Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and State of Himachal Pradesh.
Insertion of new section of 21A which enables the Central Government to make rules and procedures for PIM.
To give prospective effect to the amendment so as not to disturb the authority of the judicial forum presently adjudicating the commercial disputes as per the extant provisions of the Act.
With the rapid economic development there has been considerable increase in commercial activities and consequent steep rise in number of commercial disputes at domestic and international level.
Increase of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and overseas commercial transactions have further contributed to a significant increase of commercial disputes.
With a view to address the issue faster resolution of matters relating to commercial disputes and to create a positive image particularly among the foreign investors about the independent and responsive Indian legal system, the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 was enacted and commercial courts were established at District Levels in all jurisdictions, except in the territories over which the High Courts have original ordinary civil jurisdiction.
These five High Courts i.e. the High Courts of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Madras and of Himachal Pradesh, exercise ordinary original civil jurisdiction in regard to territories of cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and the territory of the State of Himachal Pradesh respectively.
In such territories of these High Courts as per proviso to sub-section (1) of section 3 there are no commercial courts at district level and instead Commercial Divisions have been constituted in each of these High Courts.
The specified value of such commercial disputes to be adjudicated by the Commercial Courts or the Commercial Division of High Court, as the case may be is presently Rs. one Crore.
A high ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the starting and operation of the business.
This manifests that India is fast adopting the best practices in regulatory framework for Ease of Doing Business at all fronts.

But there are very few people for whom there is pleasure in the exam; for most people exam means pressure!
And you say to yourself – Yes, Man, that was the word I wanted!
And how you could recall it outside?
It was the same you, nobody had now told you the answer!
And thus success and failure in life is not determined at all by how one has done at the examination; this is a burden from which you must free yourself.
“Today what I see as the biggest challenge facing the education is that it has come to focus solely on examinations.
Life truly means what is the knowledge that you have acquired!
Life truly goes on in terms of whether whatever you have learned, you have tried to live that also!
When you have to fight a big law suit and you go to a lawyer to engage his services, do you look at the mark-sheet of that lawyer?
But that does not mean that I’m implying that you don’t have to study at all.
Studies are definitely useful for testing our own mettle; to know where I stood yesterday and where I stand today.
Richa Ji had also mentioned about ‘PRATISPARDHA’, meaning ‘competition with others’.
How can tomorrow be made better than yesterday!
You couldn’t sleep earlier due to exam tension, are you able to sleep now?
Put yourself to test, and you’ll find that a defeat in competition with others results in frustration, disappointment, despair and jealousy, but ‘Anuspardha’ or ‘competition with self’ leads to self-analysis and introspection and makes our determination stronger and more resolute.
And when we prevail over ourselves, then the motivation to do better becomes innate, you don’t need any external sources of energy.
He further writes, “My mother was not educated.
She would then compare answers and thus be of great help to me.
Mothers who are consciously aware of and actively alert to their children’s future, play a big role in assuaging the atmosphere at home.
I shall urge parents to lay emphasis on just three points – acceptance, mentoring and sharing time.
We keep deliberating on the heavy weight of our tiny tots‘ school bags, but there are times when I feel that expectations and aspirations on the part of parents are far too heavier compared to those school bags.
Former M.P. Purushottam Mavlankar, son of India’s first Lok Sabha Speaker Ganesh Dada Mavlankar, had come to the hospital to see him.
Moreover, when I tried to use unfair means to pass the exam, I got caught and a lot of my friends around me also had to undergo distress because of me.”
Now listen to this phone call, which I have received: –
If someone says, “Let me finish with all exams first, I will play and do other things later”; well, that is impossible.
This is THE time for moulding one’s life.
A relaxed body equally relaxes your mental organs.
‘Mera Rang de Basanti Chola’ is a perfect example of that.

Slowdown in global trade is a major concern.
Prospects for increase in trade momentum remain bleak in the prevailing global economic environment.
Efforts to accelerate global economic growth will help trade.
A transparent, equitable, non-discriminatory and rule-based global trading system, is essential for the global economy.
It is absolutely vital that the Doha Development Round achieves its goals.
All elements of the Bali package should be implemented fully.
We look forward to a successful outcome at the Nairobi Meeting in December.
Regional Trade Agreements should not lead to fragmentation of the global trading system and should support a more liberalised multilateral trade regime.
Increasing the role of small and medium enterprises in the global value chain will help expand global employment.
Balanced and sustainedglobal economic growth also needs increase in labour mobility and skill portability.
Energy, ecology and economy are deeply integrated.
That is why India intends to meet its vast and growing energy needs in as sustainable manner as possible.
We are working on clean coal technology.
We have an ambitious expansion plan for nuclear energy.
By 2030, we have targeted 40% of our energy through non-fossil fuel.
International support and cooperation will enable us to achieve our goals.
As G20, we need to promote a number of measures:-
• Increase research and development in clean and renewable energy; and, reduce cost and make it affordable and accessible for all.
• Increase financial support and technology transfer to increase access and transition to clean energy.
• Focus research efforts on clean coal technology and coal gasification.
• Develop proliferation-resistant nuclear energy technology.
• Increase energy efficiency and moderate energy use.
• Promote an integrated global gas market.
• Give greater voice to major emerging economies in the global governance structure for energy.
Under the scheme, Rs 8000 crore has been earmarked for providing five crore LPG connections to BPL households.
The Scheme provides a financial support of Rs 1600 for each LPG connection to the BPL households.
The identification of eligible BPL families will be made in consultation with the State Governments and the Union Territories.
This is the first time in the history of the country that the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas would implement a welfare scheme benefitting crores of women belonging to the poorest households.
In our country, the poor have limited access to cooking gas (LPG).
The spread of LPG cylinders has been predominantly in the urban and semi-urban areas with the coverage mostly in middle class and affluent households.
But there are serious health hazards associated with cooking based on fossil fuels.
According to WHO estimates, about 5 lakh deaths in India alone due to unclean cooking fuels.
Most of these premature deaths were due to non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.
According to experts, having an open fire in the kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an hour.
Providing LPG connections to BPL households will ensure universal coverage of cooking gas in the country.
This measure will empower women and protect their health.
It will reduce drudgery and the time spent on cooking.
It will also provide employment for rural youth in the supply chain of cooking gas.
In this direction, Finance Minister in Budget speech on 29.2.2016 had announced a budgetary provision of Rs. 2000 crore for 2016-17 to provide deposit free LPG connections to 1.5 crore women belonging to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) families.

Addressing the summit, Prime Minister said that India is on the move, in terms of its economy, infrastructure, youth and many other areas.
He said that mobility is a key driver of the economy; it can boost economic growth and create employment opportunities.
Following is the full text of PM’s address:
Distinguished Delegates from across the World,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I welcome you all to the Global Mobility Summit.
Move – The name of this Summit captures the spirit of India today.
Indeed, India is on the Move:
Our economy is on the Move.
We are the world’s fastest growing major economy.
Our cities and towns are on the Move.
We are building one hundred smart cities.
Our infrastructure is on the Move.
We are building roads, airports, rail lines and ports at a quick pace.
Our goods are on the Move.
The Goods and Services Tax has helped us rationalize supply chains and warehouse networks.
Our reforms are on the Move.
We have made India an easier place to do business.
Our lives are on the Move.
Families are getting homes, toilets, smoke-free LPG cylinders, bank accounts and loans.
Our youth are on the Move.
We are fast emerging as the start-up hub of the world.
India is moving ahead with new energy, urgency and purpose
We all know that, mobility has been key to the progress of humanity.
The world is now in the middle of a new mobility revolution.
It is, therefore, important to understand mobility as a wider construct.
Mobility is a key driver of the economy.
Better mobility reduces the burden of travel and transportation and can boost economic growth.
It is already a major employer and can create the next generation of jobs.
Mobility is central to urbanization.
Motorized personal vehicles require ever-growing road, parking, and traffic infrastructure.
Mobility is critical to preserving our planet.
Road transport accounts for one fifth of global Carbon dioxide emissions.
This threatens to choke cities and raise global temperatures.
Creating a mobility eco-system that is in sync with nature is the need of the hour.
Mobility is the next frontier in our fight against Climate Change.
Better mobility can provide for better jobs, smarter infrastructure, and improve the quality of life.
It can also reduce costs, expand economic activity and protect the planet.
Thus, the mobility sector impacts larger public outcomes.
Mobility, especially the digitization of mobility, is disruptive.
It has big potential for innovation and it has been setting a searing pace!
Already, people are calling taxis on their phones, sharing bicycles in cities; buses are running on clean energy, cars are going electric.
In India, we have been laying emphasis on mobility.
We have doubled our pace of construction of highways.
We have re-energized our rural road-building programme.
We are promoting fuel efficient and cleaner fuel vehicles.
We have developed low-cost air connectivity in under-served regions.
We are also starting operations on hundreds of new air routes.
We are pushing waterways in addition to traditional modes like rail and road.
We are reducing travel distances in our cities by efficient location of homes, schools and offices.
We have also started data-driven interventions such as intelligent traffic management systems.
However, we also need to encourage pedestrians and cycling by taking steps ensure their safety and priority.
In a rapidly transforming mobility paradigm, India has some inherent strengths and comparative advantages.
Our starting point is fresh.
We have little of the legacy of resource-blind mobility.
We have fewer vehicles per capita than other major economies.
Thus, we do not carry much of the baggage of other economies that were built on the back of private car ownership!
This gives us the window of opportunity to create an all-new, seamless mobility eco-system.
On the technology front, our strengths lie in information technology, big data, digital payments, and the internet-enabled shared economy.
These elements are increasingly becoming the drivers of the global future of mobility.
Our unique identity program, Aadhaar, and its India-stack eco-system, has laid down a comprehensive public digital infrastructure.
It has digitally empowered 850 million of our citizens.
India can demonstrate how such digital infrastructure can be combined with new mobility business models.
Our renewable energy push will ensure that the environmental benefits of electric mobility can be fully realized.
We plan to draw 175 GigaWatts of energy from renewables by 2022.
We are also the sixth largest producer of renewable energy.
We have also championed the cause of solar energy globally through the International Solar Alliance.
We have a fast growing manufacturing base, especially in the automotive sector.
We also have a large, digitally literate, young population.
This provides millions of educated minds, skilled hands and aspirational dreams for powering the future.
Therefore, I am convinced that India is best placed globally, to be an early mover in the ‘Mobility Economy’.
My vision for the future of mobility in India is based on 7 C’s – Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-free, Charged, Clean and Cutting-edge.
1. Common: Public Transport must be the cornerstone of our mobility initiatives.
New business models driven by digitization, are re-inventing the current paradigm.
Big Data is enabling smarter decision-making by better understanding our patterns and needs.
Our focus must also go beyond cars, to other vehicles such as scooters and rickshaws.
Large segments of the developing world depend on these vehicles for mobility.
2. Connected mobility implies integration of geographies as well as modes of transport.
The internet-enabled Connected Sharing Economy is emerging as the fulcrum of mobility.
We must leverage the full potential for vehicle pooling and other innovative technical solutions to improve private vehicle utilization.
People from villages should be able to bring their produce to the cities with ease and efficiency.
3. Convenient mobility means safe, affordable and accessible for all sections of the society.
This includes the elderly, the women and the specially abled.
We need to ensure that public transport is preferred to private modes of travel.
4. Congestion free mobility is critical to check the economic and environment costs of congestion.
Hence, there should be emphasis on ending bottlenecks of networks.
This would result in fewer traffic jams and lower levels of stress for people travelling.
It would also lead to greater efficiency in logistics and freight.
5. Charged mobility is the way forward.
We want to drive investments across the value chain from batteries to smart charging to Electric Vehicle manufacturing.
India’s business leaders and manufacturers are now poised to develop and deploy break-through battery technology.
The India Space Research Organization uses one of the best battery systems to run satellites in space.
Other institutions can partner with ISRO to develop cost effective and efficient battery systems for electric cars.
We want to build India as a driver in Electric Vehicles.
We will soon put in place a stable policy-regime around electric and other alternative fuel vehicles.
Policies will be designed as a win-win for all, and enable huge opportunities in the automotive sector.
We should champion the idea of ‘clean kilometres’.
This could be achieved through bio-fuels electric or solar charging.
Electric Vehicles in particular can complement our investments in renewable energy.
We will do whatever it takes, because this is our commitment to our heritage, and our promise to future generations.
7. Cutting-edge: Mobility is like the Internet in its early days.
It is Cutting-edge.
It is the next big innovation sector.
The ‘Move Hack’ and ‘Pitch to Move’ events organized over the past week show how young minds are coming up with creative solutions.
Entrepreneurs should see mobility as a sector with immense opportunity for innovation and growth.
It is a sector where innovation can help solve problems for public good.
I am convinced that the ‘Mobility Revolution’ is an enabler of our growth and development.
When India transforms mobility, it benefits one fifth of mankind.
It also becomes a scaled success story, for others to replicate.
Let us build a template, for the world to adopt.
In conclusion, let me particularly appeal to the youth of India.
We should embrace this revolution early, and leverage our strengths to lead the mobility innovation ecosystem both for ourselves and for others.
The Talent and Technology assembled here today, has the capability of making a transformative mobility shift for India and the World.
This shift will be based on ‘Caring for our World’, and ‘Sharing with Others’.
May we all be Nourished
May we work together with great energy
May our intellect be Sharpened
I look forward to see what we can do together.
This summit is just the beginning.
Let us Move ahead.

Mahatma Gandhi had once said, “One must care about the world one will not see”.
Indeed, humanity has progressed when it has collectively risen to its obligation to the world and responsibility to the future.
Seventy years after the end of a tragic war and birth of a new hope for our age, we are meeting to chart a course for our humanity and our planet.
Just as our vision behind the Agenda 2030 is lofty, our goals are comprehensive.
It gives priority to the problems that have endured through the past decades.
And, it reflects our evolving understanding of the social, economic and environmental linkages that define our lives.
We live in an age of unprecedented prosperity, but also unspeakable deprivation around the world.
I am pleased that elimination of poverty in all forms everywhere is at the top of our goals.
Addressing the needs of 1.3 billion poor people in the world is not merely a question of their survival and dignity or our moral responsibility.
It is a vital necessity for ensuring peaceful, sustainable and just world.
We welcome the prominence given to environmental goals, especially climate change and sustainable consumption.
The distinct goal on ocean ecosystem reflects the unique character of its challenges and opportunities.
Equally important, it focuses our attention on the future of the island states.
I speak about Blue Revolution, which includes the prosperity, sustainable use of marine wealth and blue skies.
Today, much of India’s development agenda is mirrored in the Sustainable Development Goals.
Since Independence, we have pursued the dream of eliminating poverty from India.
We have chosen the path of removing poverty by empowering the poor.
We have placed priority on education and skill development.
We are focusing on the basics: housing, power, water and sanitation for all – important not just for welfare, but also human dignity.
These are goals with a definite date, not just a mirage of hope.
Our development is intrinsically linked to empowerment of women and it begins with a massive programme on educating the girl child that has become every family’s mission.
We are making our farms more productive and better connected to markets; and, farmers less vulnerable to the whims of nature.
We are reviving our manufacturing, improving our services sector, investing on an unprecedented scale in infrastructure; and, making our cities smart, sustainable and engines of progress.
We are committed to a sustainable path to prosperity.
It comes from the natural instinct of our tradition and culture.
But, it is also rooted firmly in our commitment to the future.
The energy intensity of our growth will continue to decline.
Sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be of great consequence to the world and our beautiful planet.
It will be a world of fewer challenges and greater hope; and, more confident of its success.
Equally, we must look for changes in our lifestyles that would make us less dependent on energy and more sustainable in our consumption.
It is equally critical to launch a global education programme that prepares our next generation to protect and conserve Nature.
I hope that the Developed World will fulfil its financing commitments for development and climate change, without in any way putting both under the same head!
I also hope that the Technology Facilitation Mechanism will turn technology and innovation into an effective instrument for global public good, not just private returns.
As we see now, distance is no insulation from challenges.
And, they can rise from the shadows of conflict and privations from distant lands.
So, we must transform international partnerships on the strength of solidarity with fellow human beings and also our enlightened self-interest.
And, we must also reform the United Nations, including its Security Council, so that it carries greater credibility and legitimacy and will be more representative and effective in achieving our goals.
There is no cause greater than shaping a world, in which every life that enters it can look to a future of security, opportunity and dignity; and, where we leave our environment in better shape for the next generation.
And, no cause that is more challenging.
At 70, we are called to rise to that challenge, with our wisdom, experience, generosity, compassion, skills and technology.
I am confident that we can.
In the end, let me express my hope for everyone’s well with a few lines from our ancient texts:-
May all be happy, may all be healthy, may all see welfare, may no one have any sorrow.

My Dear Brothers and Sisters of Gujarat,

We must work together to solve problems through talks and to contribute in efforts to take Gujarat to new heights.
This is my humble request to all the brothers and sisters of Gujarat.

Ladies & Gentlemen.
I am delighted to be here with you all at the India-South Africa Business Forum.
We are deeply honoured to have with us, Your Excellency Mr. President.
The other was Invest in India Business Forum, also in Johannesburg in November 2018.
However, there is great potential still.
I call upon all Indian and South African government agencies, investment promotion organizations as well as business leaders of both countries to work pro-actively to realize the true potential.
I was pleased to see that there has been significant participation and presence from African countries in our States.
In my earlier role as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, I was happy to welcome prominent participants from South Africa.
It is gratifying that the Vibrant Gujarat last week once again welcomed our friends and partners from South Africa in large numbers.
One day was specifically marked as ‘Africa Day’.
This shows that our bonds are much deeper than we generally realize.
It also wonderful for our bilateral economic partnership.
Ladies and Gentlemen, India’s economy currently at 2.6 trillion dollars is the fastest growing major economy of the world.
And, we are on our way to becoming the fifth largest economy globally.
We are one of the top FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD.
But, we are not satisfied.
On a daily basis, we are making necessary changes and reforms in important sectors of the economy.
Our special programmes such as Make in India, Digital India and Start-Up India have caught the imagination of the world.
Our industry has progressed towards Industry Four Point Zero and other innovative technologies including Artificial Intelligence, 3-D Printing, Robotics.
Our Government is making all efforts to increase the living standards of our 1.3 billion people, who form one-sixth of the humanity.
We are committed to building a ‘New India’ with next generation infrastructure and with emphasis on speed, skill and scale.
May I also take this opportunity to congratulate you,
on the various dynamic initiatives launched by you in 2018 towards your vision of a New South Africa.
We wish you well in your efforts to attract Foreign Direct Investment into South-Africa, as well as for the creation of over one million jobs for the youth in three years.
I am happy that India is contributing to these objectives.
Our investment into South Africa is constantly growing.
This has approached 10 billion dollars, creating over 20,000 jobs locally.
As a brotherly nation, India will be happy to share its experience in policy reforms and setting up ground level agencies.
I assure you that New India would welcome you to look at all available opportunities, particularly in Food & Agro processing, Deep mining, Defence, Fin-tech, Insurance and Infrastructure sectors.
Likewise, India could also partner with South Africa in Start-ups, Health care & Pharma, Bio-tech, IT and IT enabled sectors.
We are delighted to be a part of the South Africa skills story through the recent launch of the Gandhi Mandela Skills Institute.
This initiative seeks to empower the youth.
Another important collaboration between our two countries could be in the Gems and Jewelry sector.
Both countries could explore avenues for direct procurement of diamond.
South Africa could also join hands with India in our campaign for New and Renewable Energy, specifically through the “International Solar Alliance”.
Simplification of the existing visa regime for business-men and tourists, and direct connectivity would further ease business and people-to-people exchanges.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
There is huge untapped potential in the India-South Africa partnership.
We must work together for a new era of shared growth and prosperity for the benefit of our two countries and peoples.
I am committed, Excellency, to work shoulder-to-shoulder with you in this shared endeavor.

Energy is a key driver of economic growth.
Sustainable, stable and reasonably priced energy is essential for the fruits of economic development to reach the bottom of the pyramid.
Hydrocarbons will remain the most important source of energy for many years to come.
Therefore, the theme of the Conference “Hydrocarbons to Fuel the Future, Choices and Challenges” is both apt and timely.
This growth has been supported by a series of policy measures.
Our policies are focussed on improving India’s long term economic and social prospects, rather than on short term headlines.
Apart from fast growth, our economy has also been more stable than most others.
India’s economy is expected to grow five fold by 2040.
As per estimates, India is poised to account for one fourth of the incremental global energy demand between 2013 and 2040.
Hydrocarbons will continue to play an important part in India’s growth.
I take this opportunity to share with you some of my thoughts on the expectations from the hydrocarbon sector and our endeavour to achieve energy security.
Energy in general and hydrocarbons in particular are an important part of my vision for India’s future.
India needs energy which is accessible to the poor.
As a responsible global citizen, India is committed to combating climate change, curbing emissions and ensuring a sustainable future.
Therefore, my vision for India’s energy future has four pillars:
Use of firewood and other biomass for cooking is a health hazard for rural women.
Our Sagarmala project will connect the whole of India’s long coastline.
We have also opened up new inland shipping routes on large rivers.
These steps will improve energy efficiency.
The long awaited legislation on a national Goods and Services Tax has been passed.
To protect the vulnerable and the middle class, a subsidy is paid directly to one hundred and sixty nine million bank accounts.
This has eliminated leakages and misuse of cooking gas subsidies, resulting in large fiscal saving.
Energy sustainability, for me, is a sacred duty.
It is something India does out of commitment, not out of compulsion.
We have done this despite our low starting point in per capita energy consumption.
We have also committed to produce forty per cent of our power from non fossil fuel by 2030.
This will have to be achieved during a period of increasing oil consumption.
Almost two decades ago, India had introduced the New Exploration Licensing Regime.
This allowed one hundred per cent FDI and provided an opportunity to private players to come, invest and operate in the Indian upstream sector.
However, several factors adversely affected India’s domestic oil and gas output.
To make India a true investor friendly destination, we have come up with a new Hydrocarbon Exploration and Production Policy.
Uniform license for exploration and production for all forms of hydrocarbons, including shale oil and gas and coal bed methane
• Open acreage policy allowing bidders to choose the acreage they wish to explore
• Revenue sharing model instead of profit sharing to reduce the scope for disputes
I understand that an encouraging response has been received to the bidding process with several global companies participating.
The downstream sector is now more open, creating a level playing field for all market players.
Our proactive foreign policy and energy diplomacy is helping us to strengthen our ties with our neighbouring countries.
I hope that our oil and gas sector companies will take the opportunity to tie up with their foreign counterparts to explore for more equity oil.
Natural Gas is the next generation fossil fuel – cheaper, and less polluting.
We have given priority to move towards a gas based economy.
Efforts must be made to increase natural gas production while also creating import infrastructure to meet the growing domestic demand.
Natural gas will also have an important balancing role to play as India’s renewable energy production rises.
To provide balance and peaking power, gas-based power will be critical.
To achieve this vision, we need to be very efficient in terms of project and resource management.
I am confident that with initiatives like “Make in India”, “Startup India”, and “Standup India”, there will be opportunities for youth to venture into Indian Oil and Gas sector and to bring innovative ideas.
Technology development in refining, nanotechnology, catalyst development, biofuel and alternate energy are areas we need to focus upon.
The successful development of IndMax technology by IndianOil is an example of innovative thinking which is now on the commercial application stage.
Let me assure you that our commitment is strong and our motto is to replace Red Tape with Red Carpet.
On one hand, to meet the increaasing demand, we need affordable, and reliable, sources of energy.
Hydrocarbons will be an essential part of this mix.
On the other hand we must be sensitive towards the environment.
I am sure, this august gathering will come up with innovative ideas, in which hydrocarbons will continue to fuel the future in a more efficient and sustainable way.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today advised young IAS officers to avoid getting into a mindset that resists change, and fill India’s administrative system with the energy of ‘New India.’

“ASEAN–India poised for new synergy of robust cooperation and promising future”: Lee Hseing Loong ;
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has hailed the article by ASEAN Chair Singapore’s PM, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong.
PM Said, “A wonderful article by ASEAN Chair Singapore’s PM, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong.
He writes that as we commemorate 25 years of ASEAN -India relations, India’s ties with southeast Asia date back more than 2,000 years.
Ancient trade between India and countries such as Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand is well-documented.
Southeast Asian cultures, traditions and languages have been profoundly influenced by these early linkages.
We see Indic Hindu-Buddhist influences in historical sites such as the Angkor Temple Complex near Siem Reap in Cambodia, the Borobudor and Prambanan temples near Yogyakarta in Indonesia, and the ancient candis in Kedah in Malaysia.
The Ramayana is embedded in many southeast Asian cultures, including in Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand.
Singapore’s Malay name is Singapura, derived from Sanskrit and meaning ‘lion city’.
The visiting premier says that Singapore has always advocated India’s inclusion in the ASEAN community.
He adds that ASEAN-India relations were further elevated to a strategic partner­ship in 2012, the 20th anniversary of ASEAN-India relations.
Today, ASEAN and India enjoy multi-faceted cooperation across ASEAN’s political-security, economic and socio-cultural pillars.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Act East’ policy and 3-C (Commerce, Connectivity, Culture) formula for strengthening engagement with ASEAN speaks to our broad-based cooperation.
We have around 30 platforms for cooperation, including an annual Leaders’ Summit and seven Ministerial Dialogues.
India has participated actively in ASEAN-led platforms including the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus, and the East Asia Summit.
Talking about the tare and commerce ties, he writes that with the ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA), ASEAN-India trade has risen steadily from $2.9 billion in 1993 to $58.4 billion in 2016.
On the socio-cultural front, programs like the ASEAN-India Students Exchange Programs and the annual Delhi Dialogue foster closer people-to-people relations.
Through these platforms, our youth, academics and businessmen get to meet, learn and deepen ties.
To mark this Silver Jubilee of ASEAN-India relations, both sides have held many commemorative activities.
The recent Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Singapore recognized the contributions of the Indian diaspora.
Today’s ASEAN-India Commemorative Summit marks the culmina­tion of these celebrations.
It is an honour for all the ASEAN leaders to be in New Delhi for this occasion.
ASEAN leaders are also deeply honoured to be invited as chief guests at tomorrow’s 69th Republic Day Parade.
The Singapore PM writes that Major global trends are reshaping the strategic outlook, presenting both challenges and opportunities.
The strategic balance is shifting.
According to the visiting premier this geopolitical uncertainty gives new impetus to ASEAN’s cooperation with key partners like India.
ASEAN and India share common interests in peace and security in the region, and an open, balanced and inclusive regional architecture.
India is located strategically along major sea-lanes from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.
These sea lanes are also vital trade routes for many ASEAN member states.
Both sides share an interest in preserving these vital maritime conduits of trade.
Mr. Lee Hsien Loong underlines the importance and strength of ASEAN and India’s combined population of 1.8 billion which represents one quarter of the world’s population.
The combined GDP exceeds $4.5 trillion.
Both regions are also experiencing a demographic dividend – 60% of ASEAN’s population is below 35 years old, while India is projected to be the world’s youngest country with an average age of 29 by 2020.
Against this backdrop, there is still much scope to grow India-AEAN ties – India accounted for only 2.6% of ASEAN’s external trade in 2016.
The visiting premier has suggested three promising areas of mutually beneficial collaboration.
First, ASEAN and India should redouble efforts to promote trade and investment.
We need to keep existing pathways up to date and relevant, including the AIFTA.
We should work together to conclude a high quality Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), surpassing the existing AIFTA.
This would create an integrated Asian market comprising nearly half the world’s population and a third of the world’s GDP.
Stream­lining rules and regulations will stimulate investments in both directions, complement India’s ‘Act East’ policy and facilitate ‘Made in India’ exports to the region.
Second, our people will benefit greatly from greater land, air and maritime connectivity.
Mr. Mr. Lee Hsien Loong says that India and ASEAN continue to look for new synergies.
India is rapidly urbanizing and has set itself a goal of establishing 100 smart cities.

Agreement on mutual visa exemption for holders of diplomatic, Special, service and official passports
MoU on Academic and Scholarly cooperation sectors between National Defence College Sultanate of Oman and the Institute for Defence Studies and the Analyses.
Annexure to the MoU on Military Cooperation.
Mr. Philippe Etienne, Diplomatic Advisor to the President of the French Republic called on the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
Mr. Etienne briefed the Prime Minister on the strengthening ties between India and France in all sectors, including in the areas of defence and security.
The Prime Minister fondly recalled his successful visit to France in June 2017.
There are only a few occasions when the leadership of the Centre and the States, assembles together.
This forum of cooperative federalism is the perfect setting to deliberate on the interests of the people, address their problems, and take collective and concrete decisions.
It highlights the vision of the makers of our Constitution.
Let me begin by recalling what our beloved former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had said at this very forum sixteen years ago:
“In a democracy as big and diverse as ours, debate, deliberation and discussion help evolve policy that relates to the ground reality.
More importantly, they enable the effective implementation of such policies.
The Inter-State Council is an inter-governmental forum that can be used for evolving policy as well as ensuring its implementation.
I, therefore, urge the States to increasingly use this forum as an effective instrument to strengthen our democracy, our society and our polity.”
The Inter-State Council is certainly the most significant platform for strengthening Centre-State and Inter-State relations.
There has been a long hiatus since the last meeting in 2006, but I am happy that through the efforts of Home Minister Rajnath Singh ji, the process has been restarted.
Over the last one year, he has convened meetings of five zonal councils.
The increased dialogue and connect has culminated in this gathering today.
The nation can progress only if the Union and State Governments walk shoulder to shoulder.
It would be difficult for any Government to successfully implement a scheme on its own.
Therefore, provision of adequate financial resources is as important as the responsibility for implementation.
With the acceptance of the 14th Finance Commission recommendations, the States’ share in central taxes has increased from 32 per cent to 42 per cent.
This means that States now have greater financial resources to utilize in accordance with their requirements.
I am happy to share that the total amount received by States from the Centre during 2015-16 is 21 per cent higher than the amount received in 2014-15.
Auctions of other mines will yield an additional 18,000 crore rupees to states.
Similarly, through amendments to CAMPA Act, we are attempting to free up about 40,000 crore rupees lying idle in banks, for disbursal to States.
The Union Government also wishes to share with States, the amount that is being saved as a result of transparency being introduced into the system.
Kerosene is one example.
Electricity connections are increasing in villages.
The Union Government will provide 5 crore new cooking gas connections over the next three years.
The supply of LPG will further increase.
All these efforts have a direct bearing on the consumption of kerosene.
Recently, the Chandigarh administration declared the city a kerosene-free zone.
Now, the Union Government has launched a scheme, under which, if there is a reduction in the consumption of kerosene by a State, the Centre will disburse 75 per cent of the resultant savings in subsidy, as grant to that State.
The Government of Karnataka, while moving swiftly on this initiative, has sent its proposal to the Petroleum Ministry.
This has been accepted and the grant has been disbursed to the State Government.
If all States decide to reduce kerosene consumption by 25 per cent, and actually do so, they can receive about 1600 crore rupees as grant this year.
Apart from Centre-State relations, the Inter State Council is an appropriate forum to discuss matters which are of concern to large segments of our population.
The passage of this Act enables us to use Aadhaar for Direct Cash Transfers for subsidy and other services.
As on date, 102 crore Aadhaar cards have been distributed in our country of 128 crore people.
79 per cent of our people now have Aadhaar cards.
Among adults, 96 per cent people have Aadhaar cards.
With your support, we shall connect every citizen of the country with an Aadhaar card by the year-end.
Today the simple Aadhaar card has become a symbol of empowerment.
Benefits now flow only to people genuinely entitled to receive them, with money getting directly credited to their bank accounts.
This has not only brought in transparency, but also resulted in savings of thousands of crores of rupees, which are being utilized for development.
Friends, Babasaheb Ambedkar had written – “The path of social reform like the path to heaven at any rate in India, is strewn with many difficulties.
Social reform in India has few friends and many critics.”
Another important area of discussion in the Inter State Council is Education.
India’s greatest asset is its youth.
More than 30 crore children are currently of school-going age.
Hence, our country has the potential to provide the world with skilled manpower for many years to come.
Deen Dayal Upadhyay: “Education is an investment.
While planting trees, we do not charge them any fee.”
We are aware that these trees will give us oxygen in the future, and benefit the environment.
Since then we have come a long way in terms of education.
But a lot still remains to be done with regard to the standard of education.
We must discuss the extent to which our system of education is genuinely educating our children.
The best way of improving the standard of education among children is to make them aware of the purpose of education.
Merely going to school is not education.
It should motivate them to continuously keep learning throughout their lives.
Swami Vivekananda also used to say that education does not mean merely attaining bookish knowledge.
The aim of education is character building.
Education means strengthening the mind, and enhancing one’s intellect, so that one can become self-reliant.
Given the kind of efficiency and ability that is required in the economy of the 21st century, it is our responsibility to ensure that our youth are equipped with at least some skill-sets.
We have to prepare our youth to think logically, think out of the box, and work creatively.
Internal Security is another important issue on the agenda today.
We have to discuss internal security challenges confronting the country, the solutions to these challenges, and mutual cooperation in this regard.
In doing so, we shall not only strengthen the spirit of cooperative federalism and Centre-State relations, but also secure a better future for our citizens.
Mr Solih thanked the Prime Minister for his greetings and good wishes.
The two leaders agreed to work closely together to further strengthen the close, friendly and good neighbourly relations between the two countries.

b) Servicing of interest and principal of debt extended to FCI through the budget line of Department of Food and Public Distribution.
The repayment obligation of the FCI in respect of NSSF Loans would be treated as the first charge on the food subsidy released to the Food Corporation of India.
In addition, FCI shall reduce the amount of its current Cash Credit Limit with the banking consortium to the extent of the NSSF loan amount.
A legally binding agreement will be signed between FCI, Department of Food and Public Distribution and Ministry of Finance on behalf of NSSF on the modalities for repayment of interest rate and principal and the restructuring of FCI debt will be made possible within 2-5 years.
Increased availability of the NSSF loan to Gol may reduce the Gol’s market borrowings.

Barring Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, the other State Governments/UTs expressed a desire to be excluded from NSSF investments.

The loan contracted by States till 31.3.2016, from the National Small Savings Fund will stand completely repaid by the Financial Year 2038-39.
NSSF shall extend a part of its collections to Food Corporation of India (FCI) to meet its food subsidy requirement.
This will help the FCI reduce its interest cost.
FCI presently takes working capital loans through Cash Credit Limit (CCL) at an interest rate of 10.01% and Short Term Loan (STL) at a weighted average interest rate of 9.40%, whereas the NSSF currently charges 8.8% p.a interest on its loans.

I’m grateful to the government of Myanmar for this.
Your courageous leadership of Myanmar peace process is praiseworthy.
We thoroughly understand the challenges that you have been facing.
We are partners in your concerns over the loss of lives of security forces and innocent people due to the extremist violence in Rakhine State.
Be it a large peace process or be it to resolve a specific problem, we hope that all the stakeholders can work together in the direction to find such a solution that will ensure peace, justice and dignity for all by respecting the unity and territorial integrity of Myanmar.
I believe that India’s democratic experience is also relevant for Myanmar.
And therefore we are pride of our comprehensive cooperation in the capacity building of the institutions like the executive, the legislature, election commission and press council.
Our interests in the area of security are common as neighbors.
It’s essential that we work together to ensure the stability of our long territorial and coastal borders.
The construction of roads and bridges, links in the field of energy and our efforts to boost connectivity indicate in the direction of a good future.
We have completed the work on the Sittwe port and Paletwa Inland Waterways Terminal in Kaladan project.
And the work on road component has started.
In order to meet the requirement of Upper Myanmar, two way movement of high speed diesel trucks have started from India.
Development of high quality health, education and research facilities in Myanamar under our development partnership is a cause of happiness.
In this context, Myanmar Institute of Information Technology and Advanced Centre for Agricultural Research and Education are worthy of special mention.
Both of these are emerging as the main centers of education.
In the future, our projects will only be according to the needs and priorities of Myanmar.
The agreements signed by us today between our two countries will further strengthen our multifaceted bilateral cooperation.
I am happy to announce that we have decided to give gratis visa to all citizens of Myanmar who are interested in coming to India.
I am also happy to state that we have decided to release 40 citizens of Myanmar who are currently lodged in the jails of India.
We hope that they will soon be able to meet with their families in Myanmar.
My time in Nay Pyi Taw was very meaningful.
I am also very excited about my remaining stay in Myanmar.
Today I will go to the Anand Temple in the Bagan.
The renovation work of Ananda Temple and other historic and cultural buildings is being carried out with the help of India to repair the damages caused to them due last year’s earthquake.
Apart from meeting the community of Indian origin people in Yangon, I will also pay my tributes at the monuments of religious and historical importance.
I believe that in the coming time, we will work together to build a strong and close partnership for our mutual benefit.

Let us work shoulder to shoulder to create the India that our freedom fighters would be proud of. #SankalpSeSiddhi”, the Prime Minister said.

My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on this auspicious occasion of Independence Day.
Today, the country is brimming with self-confidence.
The country is scaling new heights by working extremely hard, with a resolve to realize its dreams.
My dear countrymen, we are celebrating this festival of independence at a time when our daughters from the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, have come back after circumnavigating the seven seas.
They have returned after unfurling the Tricolour in the seven seas, colouring their waters with the hues of our Tricolor.
However, during this festival of independence, I will remember our young tribal children from remote forest areas, who have unfurled the Tricolour on the Mount Everest, further enhancing its glory.
This time, our Parliament has accorded Constitutional status to this Commission, and in doing so, has made an efforts to protect the interests of the Backward and the Most Backward classes.
Today, we are celebrating the festival of independence at a time when news reports have brought in a new consciousness in the country.
Today, every Indian, living in any nook and corner of the world, takes pride in the fact that India has become the sixth largest economy of the world.
Under the leadership of respected Bapu, lakhs of people sacrificed their lives and spent their youth in prisons to win freedom for our country.
Many great revolutionaries embraced the gallows bravely.
Today on behalf of my countrymen, I pay homage to those brave freedom fighters and salute them from the bottom of my heart.
My best wishes are always with them.
These days, we are receiving the news of good rainfall as well as floods from different parts of the country.
I want to reassure the people who have lost their loved ones and are in distress, that the country is with them in their hour of crisis to help them overcome this difficult situation.
I share the grief of those who have lost their near and dear ones in this natural calamity.
Our freedom has come at a price.
– ( “Ellarum amarnillai aaedumnaan
Subramania Bharti said that India will show the way for the entire world to break free from every form of bondage.
Our Constitution has been guiding us in realizing our dreams by stating that every section of the society and every geographical part of India must get an equal opportunity in the quest to forge ahead.
Dear brothers and sisters,
The Constitution also guides us to draw inspiration from our Tricolor.
They have come together, were together and will continue to be together.
What is our Motherland?
If we had maintained the speed of 2013 in laying optical fibre network in villages, then we would not have been able to accomplish the task for generations together.
We will strive to maintain the same pace of development.
A new spirit, new energy, new resolve, new determination and new inspiration is taking the country forward.
This is why the country has doubled the pace of construction of the highways.
The construction of new houses has gone up four times in the villages.
The food production in the country today has reached an all-time high; there has been a record production of mobile phones; the sale of tractors has touched a new high.
On the one hand, a record number of tractors are being bought by our farmers today, at the same time, the country has witnessed a record number of aeroplane purchases since independence.
Toilets are being built in schools; new IIMs, new IITs and new AIIMS are being established.
Giving momentum to Skill Development Missions, the country is setting up new centers in small towns.
As a government sensitive to the needs of people, efforts are being made to turn Digital India into a reality.
At the same time, work is also progressing with the same dedication to compile dictionary and common signs for my differently-abled brothers and sisters.
While on the one hand, our farmers are working on modern agricultural techniques like micro irrigation, drip irrigation and sprinklers, on the other hand, 99 big closed irrigation projects have also been revived.
Our soldiers reach out to provide relief and rescue operations during natural calamities.
While our soldiers display exemplary courage in reaching out to rescue the people in difficulties, they have also shown a steely resolve to carry out surgical strikes and vanquish our enemies.
Take a glance at the vast canvass of the development in our country- from one end to the other, one can witness the progress of the country that is moving ahead with new energy and enthusiasm.
I hail from Gujarat.
There is a saying in Gujarati ‘Nishan Chuk Maaf Lekin Nahi Maaf Nichu Nishan’ which means one should have big aims and dreams.
My dear brothers and sisters,
We are not the kind of people who work in the interest of the party.
We are capable of taking tough decisions because national interest is topmost in our priority.
My dear brothers and sisters,
In this era of global economy, the entire world is looking at every development in India – big or small, with deep interest and hope and expectations.
North-East is going to host the Sports University.
Brothers and sisters, there was a time when the North-East used to feel that Delhi is very distant.
Within four years, we have brought Delhi to the doorsteps of North-East.
My dear countrymen, 13 crore Mudra Loans has been a major achievement.
More so, if it includes 4 crore youth who have taken the loan for the first time with the aspiration to become self-reliant and are promoting self-employment.
Dear brothers and sisters, I would like to congratulate our scientists and technicians for such a great accomplishment.
I sincerely acknowledge the role of our agricultural scientists, cultivators and farmers in successfully steering the green revolution across decades.
But my brothers and sisters, times have changed now.
Our farmers and the agricultural markets have to face global challenges and competition.
It is a matter of great satisfaction that today our country is the second highest fish producer in the world and is on the verge of reaching the top position soon.
It means, in rural economy other businesses allied to agriculture are also as important as agriculture.
Khadi is associated with the name of respected Bapu.
My brothers and sisters, the farmers of my country are emphasizing on solar farming now.
On the 25th of September, the birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, the Pradhanmantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan will be launched throughout the country.
No poor person of the country will have to face difficulty in dealing with diseases.
Nor he would have to borrow money from a moneylender paying interest.
His family will not be destroyed.
And it will also open new avenues of employment for the youth, for the middle class families in the health sector.
New hospitals will be built in the tier-2 and tier-3 cities.
They will require medical staff in large numbers.
A lot of employment opportunities will also be generated.
Brothers and sisters, no poor person wants to lead a life of penury.
No poor person wants to die poor.
No poor person wants to pass on his poverty as a legacy to his children.
Throughout his life, he struggles to come out of poverty.
There is only one way to end this problem- through the empowerment of poor people.
And, at least I can never keep my eyes shut to this kind of thing.
When a poor person used to approach the shop with his ration card and request grain, the shopkeeper would say that the stock was over.
Therefore, it is the result of your honest paying of taxes when you have your meal with your family, 3 poor families are also able to have their meals at the same time.
Till 2013, i.e. for the last 70 years, there were 4 crore people who were paying direct taxes.
Are not these glaring figures a true reflection of honesty?
Therefore, we will not tolerate black money and corruption.
Dear countrymen, times have changed.
Strong action is being taken against corrupt officers.
More than three lakh dubious companies have been closed down, and restrictions have been imposed on their directors.
Today, we have introduced IT interventions for online transactions to ensure transparency.
This is the first time after independence that the Union Cabinet has the maximum representation of women ministers.
Brothers and sisters, I want to reassure my Muslim sisters.
Triple Talaq has spoiled the lives of Muslim daughters of our country.
Those who have not faced the Talaq are spending their lives under pressure.
We wanted to bring a legislation in this session of Parliament itself to free Muslim women from this evil system.
But there are some people who are obstructing the passage of this Bill.
I will fulfill your aspirations.
My beloved countrymen, our army, paramilitary forces, police, intelligence agencies are the source of strength for our country’s internal security.
They have created a sense of security in us.
They have ensured a peaceful environment.
A new confidence has been generated because of their sacrifices, dedication and hard work.
Brothers and Sisters, we used to hear about incidents of violence every now and then from the North East, there were reports of insurgency.
But today the two states of Meghalaya and Tripura have seen withdrawal of the Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA) which was in force for three or four decades.
Several districts of Arunachal Pradesh have also been brought out of the purview of the Armed Forces Special Power Act.
Now, it is in force only in a few districts.
Left Wing Extremism, Maoism have been bleeding the country.
Violent incidents, people fleeing from homes and hiding in forests were a matter of daily occurrence.
However, today because of continuous efforts by our security forces, launching of development projects and efforts to connect the people with national mainstream, left-wing extremism which affected 126 districts has now been reduced to 90 districts.
The work on finding a solution to put an end to left wing extremism from those districts is progressing rapidly.
Brothers and Sisters, regarding Jammu & Kashmir, the path shown by Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji is the right one.
We want to move ahead on that road.
The elections could not be held for some reason or the other.
I am happy that the villagers of Jammu and Kashmir will have this opportunity in the coming months.
A system in which villagers will be able to look after their villages will be in place soon.
Now, the Government of India gives huge funds which go directly to the villages and this will help the village headmen to take their villages on the path of development.
And that is why we are going ahead with this aim and today standing under this tricolour, once again I want to reiterate the resolve for which we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.
Let every Indian have a house of his own – Housing for All.
Every house should have electricity connection, power for all.
I am impatient as several countries have gone ahead of us, I am restless and impatient to take my country ahead of all these countries.
My dear countrymen, I am worked up and I am restless because malnutrition has been a major hurdle in the development of the children of our country.
It remains a huge bottleneck.
My dear countrymen, I am restless because I want that my country should take maximum advantage of its capabilities and resources and we can move forward in the world with a sense of pride.
My dear countrymen, we want to move ahead.
We cannot accept stagnation, we cannot be standstill and it is not in our nature to bend before anybody.
This country will neither come to a standstill, neither will it bend and nor will it get tired.
We have to achieve greater heights, we have to keep moving ahead.
Brothers and sisters, we are the inheritors of the rich heritage of our ancient legacy of Vedas.
And that legacy is due to our self-confidence, and we want to carry forward the legacy.
We want to move forward with the dream of being at the top.
And that is why my dear countrymen…
Once again on the sacred occasion of independence, I offer my best wishes.

I am truly honoured by your warm welcome and friendship.
I am conscious of the significance of this visit.
It is the first standalone bilateral visit to Sri Lanka by an Indian Prime Minister since 1987.
Last month, President Sirisena honoured us by making India his first foreign visit as President.
I am glad to be here so soon.
This is how it should be between neighbours.
We should meet regularly.
It helps us understand each other better; find solutions to mutual concerns; and, move our relationship forward.
That is what we achieved in my meetings with President Sirisena today.
Economic ties are a key pillar of our relationship.
The progress we have made reflects our shared commitment to stronger economic cooperation.
Our trade has seen impressive growth over the past decade.
I am aware of your concerns about trade with India.
As I said in Delhi, we will try and address them.
The agreement today on cooperation between our customs authorities is a step in that direction.

We are not just looking at addressing problems.
We are also focusing on new opportunities.
A Joint Task Force will be constituted soon to work out the modalities.
India stands ready to help Trincomalee become a regional petroleum hub.
I also look forward to early commencement of work on the ground in the Sampur Coal Power Project.

It can then be taken forward by both governments.
I also took this opportunity to convey our admiration for President Srinisena`s efforts to build an inclusive future for Sri Lanka.

One Shri Sachin has written to urge that in ‘Mann Ki Baat’ this time a mention may please be made about Sindhu, Saakshi and Deepa Karmakar.

They may write to the government; associations may discuss these issues and submit their memoranda to the government.
Also, his mantra “Swaraj, that is, freedom is my birthright” should have the main focus thereby strengthening the freedom movement.
Good governance, SURAAJ, should be our priority; can we not recite this mantra and give a message for it in the public Ganesh festival celebrations?
I congratulate all the Pradhans who had assembled in Allahabad with this resolve from different States; they had come from Uttrakhand, from Uttar Pradesh, from Bihar, from Jharkhand and from West Bengal.
In Kabirdham district of Chhatisgarh more than 1.25 lakh students from about 1700 schools collectively wrote letters to their parents.

To keep this country of manifold diversities united, we all as citizens, as society and as the government, have a responsibility to encourage things which strengthen our national unity and highlight these with full vigour, only then we can make our country’s future bright, and, of course, this will be achieved.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today delivered the opening remarks at the fourth meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog, in Rashtrapati Bhawan Cultural Centre in New Delhi.
Welcoming the Chief Ministers and other delegates, the Prime Minister reiterated that the Governing Council is a platform that can bring about “historic change.”
He assured the Chief Ministers from flood-affected States that the Union Government would provide all assistance to them, to deal with the flood situation currently affecting parts of the country.
He said that the Governing Council has approached complex issues of governance as “Team India”, in the spirit of cooperative, competitive federalism.
He described the smooth rollout and implementation of GST as a prime example of this.
He added that the challenge now is to take this growth rate to double digits, for which many more important steps have to be taken.
He said that the vision of a New India by 2022, is now a resolve of the people of our country.
He emphasized the need for tackling economic imbalances on priority.
He said that all aspects and parameters of human development need to be addressed and improved upon in the 115 aspirational districts.

The Union Cabinet under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved redevelopment of residential colonies at West Ansari Nagar and Ayur Vigyan Nagar Campuses of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AllMS), New Delhi.
The project shall be implemented on self-financing basis by sale of commercial space on free hold basis with no cost to the exchequer to the Government.
The project will be completed in five years in a phased manner.
The present residential accommodations at West Ansari Nagar and Ayur Vigyan Nagar campuses are more than 50-60 years old and have outlived their utility.
They are unsafe to live in.
The rapidly deteriorating condition of these old houses entails very high expenditure on their maintenance.
The existing housing stock in AllMS, New Delhi demonstrates highly inefficient use of the land.
They are outstanding leaders of Asia.
They reflect Asia’s diversity, and its common spirit.
I am delighted to visit Republic of Korea in the first year of my Government.
Long before Korean brands had found their way into Indian homes, Koreans had found their way into Indian hearts.
Nearly a hundred years ago, India’s great poet, Rabindranath Tagore called Korea the Lamp of the East.
Today, Korea is proving him right.
Korea’s economic miracle and global leadership in technology has made the promise of the Asian Century more real.
Korea is a pillar of democracy and a force of stability in Asia and Pacific.
Asia’s re-emergence is the greatest phenomenon of our era.
It started in Japan and then extended to China, Korea and Southeast Asian nations.
In the West, nations like Qatar are transforming their desert landscapes into booming economies.
India’s potential has never been in doubt.
And, in the course of the past year, we are translating promise into a reality; hope into confidence.
The world speaks in one voice that India is the new bright spot of hope for our region and the world.
The progress of one-sixth of humanity will also be an opportunity for the world.
It will also give India the capacity to do more for our world.
Above all, India’s progress will be an Asian success story.
And, it will help make our Asian dream a bigger reality.
This is because Asia will succeed more when all of Asia rises together.
Asia must not have two faces – one of hope and prosperity; the other of want and despair.
That is why the future I dream for India is also the future I want for our neighbours.
I am pleased to see many in Asia assume that responsibility.
This is the principle that guides India’s policies.
And, it comes from our timeless belief in the world as one family “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”
We must also empower our youth with skills and education, so that they can look to the future with hope.
Over the next 40 years, three billion Asians will lift themselves into a higher level of prosperity.
Asia’s prosperity and rising population will place a huge demand on our limited resources.
So, our footprint on earth must become lighter as our economic weight increases.
That is why I have often called for a change in lifestyle and new pathways to prosperity.
And, I believe it is possible, without compromising our future.
Asia must also use its capacity for innovation and frugal manufacturing for affordable renewable energy.
Reverence for nature is part of our shared heritage.
Combating climate change is in our enlightened self-interest.
That is why India has set a goal of 175 Giga Watts of new renewable energy capacity over the next five years.
But, coal and oil will remain the key source of energy for all of us for a long time to come.
So, let us work together to make them cleaner and less harmful for Nature.
Our vision of inclusive growth will be incomplete unless we pool our innovation and technologies to transform our region’s agriculture.
Many of us have similar ecosystems and rural economies.
And, we have a long history of learning from each other.
By 2025, a majority of Asians will live in cities.
Many urban clusters in Asia will exceed the population of mid-sized countries elsewhere in the world.
By then, by some estimates, India will host around 11% of the global urban population.
So, creating livable and sustainable cities of tomorrow should be our collective goal.
That is why in India, I have placed so much emphasis on urban renewal and smart cities.
And, there is much that we can learn from cities like Seoul.
If Asia must rise as one, Asia should no longer think of itself in regional fragments.
Today, what happens in West Asia has a strong impact on East Asia.
And what happens on the oceans will have influence on the Asian highlands.
India is located at Asia’s crossroads.
And, we will assume our responsibility to build an inter-connected Asia.
We must connect our regions through infrastructure and integrate them through trade and investments.
We must build institutions that promote cooperation on the principles of equality, co-existence and international rules and norms.
This will also mean that we work together to safeguard our commons for the benefit of all – our oceans, outer space and the cyber space.
This is a responsibility of each Nation towards one another.
It is also our collective task against our common challenges –terrorism; trans-national crimes; natural disasters; and, diseases.
Asia of dynamism, but also of uncertainties must lead in shaping its course.
But, Asia of growing weight will also have to take greater responsibility for the world.
And, it must also seek a larger role in global affairs.
We must work as Asians to reform the global institutions of governance, including the United Nations and its Security Council.
Asia of rivalries will hold us back.
Asia of unity will shape the world.
In conclusion, I wish to say this.
Through its history, Asia has been linked by the flow of religions, culture, knowledge and trade.
We have risen from tragic conflicts and the long shadow of colonialism.
We have also seen Asia’s strength and spirit.
Let us now draw upon our heritage and synergies, our ancient wisdom and youthful energy, to pursue a common purpose.
For ourselves and the world.

He emphasized that visible and measurable results should be seen by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence.
Senior officials repeatedly emphasized that initiatives of the Union Government such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Mission Indradhanush, Beti Bachao – Beti Padhao, and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana etc, are having a positive impact on nutrition.
In this context, the Prime Minister called for convergence among all schemes of Union and State Governments, which directly or indirectly have an impact on nutrition outcomes.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved Submission of India’s second Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change towards fulfilment of the reporting obligation under the Convention.
The net national GHG emissions after including LULUCF were 23,06,295 Gg COa equivalent (around 2.306 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent).
iv. The State Councils are also envisioned to mirror the Central Council,comprising 7 ex-officio and 21 non-ex officio members and Chairperson tobe elected from amongst the non-ex officio members.
v.Professional Advisory Bodies under Central and State Councils will examine issues independently and provide recommendations relating to specific recognised categories.
vi. The Bill will also have an overriding effect on any other existing law for any of the covered professions.
vii. The State Council will undertake recognition of allied and healthcare institutions.
X. Central Govt. also has the power to issue directions to the Council, tomake regulations and to add or amend the schedule.
An Interim Council will be constituted within 6 months of passing of the Act holding charge for a period of two years until the establishment of the Central Council.
However, since this Bill is directed to strengthen the healthcare delivery system at large, it may be saidthat the entire population of the country and the health sector as a whole will be benefited by this Bill.
1. In the current state of healthcare system, there exist many allied and healthcare professionals, who remain unidentified, unregulated and underutilised.
Our system is highly focused on efforts towards strengthening limited categories of professionals such as doctors, nurses and frontline workers (like Accredited Social Health Activist or ASHAs, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife or ANMs).
However, numerous others have been identified over the years, whose potential can be utilised to improve and increase the access to quality driven services in the rural and hard to reach areas.
2. Allied and Healthcare Professionals (A&HPs) constitute an important element of the health human resource network, and the skilled and efficient Allied and Healthcare Professionals (A&HPs) can reduce the cost of care and dramatically improve the accessibility to quality driven healthcare services.
3. Globally, Allied and Healthcare Professionals typically attend undergraduate degree programme of a minimum of three to four years to begin with and may attain up to PhD level qualification in their respective streams.
However, most of Indian institutions offering such courses lack standardisation.
4. Majority of the countries worldwide, have a statutory licensing or regulatory body that is authorised to license and certify the qualifications and competence of such professionals, particularly those involved in direct patient care (such as physiotherapist, nutritionist etc.) or those whose occupation impact patient care directly (such as lab technologists, dosimetrists etc.).
5. Though such professionals have existed in the Indian healthcare system for many decades, a considerable gap in the allied and healthcare space is because of a lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework and absence of standards for education and training of A&HPs.

The setting up of new units at Sindri, Gorakhpur and Barauni will meet the growing demand of urea of Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand.
It will also ease the pressure on railway and road infrastructure due to long distance transportation of urea from Western and Central Regions and thereby saving in Govt. subsidy on freight.
It will also accelerate the economic development of the region.
Apart from growth of regional economy, this unit will create opportunities for 1200 direct and 4500 indirect employments.
These units were lying defunct since their closure during 1990-2002.
Therefore, the units and other associated facilities were lying unutilized.
It is important to mention here that there is no functional urea unit in the Eastern part of the country except two small units at Namrup (Assam).
The annual consumption of urea in the country is approx.

Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea;
Minister for Commerce & Industry, Government of India;
President and CEO of the Chosun-ilboGroup;
Business Leaders of Korea and India;
I am very happy to be here with you.
Such a large gathering of Korean companies in India is actually a global story.
I take this opportunity to welcome all of you to India.
The relationship between India and Korea dates back centuries.
It is believed that an Indian Princess travelled to Korea and became a queen in Korea.
We are also bound by our Buddhist traditions.
Our Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore composed a poem – ‘Lamp of the East’ – in 1929 about Korea’s glorious past and its bright future.
Bollywood films are also very popular in Korea.
And at the Pro-Kabaddi league in India a few months ago, some of the loudest cheers, were reserved for a Korean Kabaddi player.
It is also a good co-incidence that India and South Korea both celebrate their Independence Day on the 15th of August.
From Princess to poetry and from Buddha to Bollywood; we have so much in common.
As I have mentioned earlier, I have always been fascinated by Korea.
I visited Korea when I was Chief Minister of Gujarat.
I used to wonder how a country of the size of Gujarat can make such economic progress.
I admire the spirit of enterprise of the Korean people.
I admire the way in which they have created and sustained their global brands.
From IT and Electronics to Automobile and Steel, Korea has given exemplary products to the world.
Korean companies are appreciated for their innovation, and strong manufacturing capability.
It is heartening to note that our bilateral trade crossed 20 billion dollars last year, for the first time in six years.
My visit in 2015 led to a positive focus on India.
Your open market policies have found resonance with India’s economic liberalization and ‘Look East Policy’.
Over 500 Korean companies are operating in India too.
In fact, many of your products are house-hold names in India.
However, South Korea ranks only 16th in FDI Equity inflows to India.
India offers a lot of potential for the Korean Investors with its huge market and enabling policy environment.
Since many of you are already present in India, you already know the ground realities.
Also, through your interaction with Indian CEOs, you must have already discovered the direction in which India is going.
If you see around the globe, there are very few countries where you have three important factors of economy together.
They are: Democracy, Demography and Demand.
In India, we have all the three together.
By Democracy, I mean the system based on liberal values which ensures free and fair play towards one and all.
By Demography, I mean a vast and talented pool of young and energetic workforce.
By Demand, I mean a big and growing market for goods and services.
A rising middle class is creating further growth in the domestic market.
We have worked towards creating a stable business environment, ensuring the rule of law, and removing arbitrariness in decision making.
We seek positivity in day to day transactions.
We are widening the areas of trust; rather than digging into doubts.
This represents a complete change of the Government’s mindset.
A shift from issuing authority to business partner to achieve ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.
And when this happens, simplification of rules and procedures starts automatically.
Nearly 65 percent to 70 percent of the items previously under licensing can now be produced without a license.
We have said that factory inspections will only be need-based and only on authorization of the higher authority.
In Dime are one of the most open countries now.
Most of the sectors of our economy are open for FDI.
There is practically no requirement of Government approval for investments in manufacturing sector except for Defense sector.
Incorporating a company along with allotment of statutory numbers is now just a one day affair.
We have carried out thousands of reforms on the business, investment, governance and cross border trading front.
Some of them like GST are historic.
Many of you might already be experiencing the ease in operations due to GST.
FDI inflows have grown the most in the last three years.
A new start up eco-system has been un-veiled.
With unique ID and mobile phone penetration, we are fast moving towards becoming a Digital Economy.
Our, strategy is to leverage the strength of hundreds of millions of Indians who have come online in recent years.
We have improved 31 places in last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum.
We have also moved up twenty one places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in two years.
Now, we have a world class engineering education base and strong R&D facilities.
An informal economy into a formal economy, you can imagine the range and span of our work.
We are already the third-largest economy by purchasing power.
Very soon, we will become the world’s fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP.
We are also the fastest growing major economy of the world today.
We are also a country with the one of the largest Start up eco-systems.
Our vision is to create a globally competitive industry and services base equipped with skill, speed and scale.
We particularly want to promote manufacturing in a big way to create jobs for our youth.
For this purpose, we have launched a campaign called “Make in India”.
This includes bringing our industrial infrastructure, policies and practices to best global standards and to convert India into a global manufacturing hub.
This initiative has been well supplemented by programmers like ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’.
Cleaner and greener development and Zero defect Zero effect manufacturing is another commitment.
We have committed to the world and are moving aggressively for adoption of better environmental technologies.
I have said earlier that there is huge potential for cooperation between India’s software and Korea’s IT industry.
Your car making and our designing capabilities can be put together.
Though we have become the third biggest producer of steel, we need to add lot of value in it.
Your steel-making capacity and our resources of iron ore can be put together for better products.
Similarly, your ship-building capacity and our agenda of port led development can become a driver of our partnership.
India and Korea are major economies in the region.
Our partnership has immense potential to promote regional growth, development, stability and prosperity in Asia.
India is turning to the East for bigger economic engagement.
Similarly, South Korea is trying to diversify its overseas markets.
Both stand to gain by deepening their partnership.
The mandate of Korea Plus is to promote, facilitate and retain Korean investments in India.
It is envisaged as the first reference point for Korean Investors in India.
Korea Plus has facilitated more than 100 Korean Investors in a short span of about two years.
It acts as a partner throughout the investment cycle of Korean companies.
This shows our commitment towards welcoming Korean people and companies; ideas and investments.
I would like to conclude by saying that India is now ready for business.
India is now a free destination for enterprise.
You will not find such a free and growing market anywhere in the world.
I further assure you that whatever is required to promote and protect your investments will be done here.
Because we value your involvement and contribution in our economy.
At a personal level too, I assure you of my full support whenever required.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of imbibing safety norms and soft skills as integral parts of skill development.
· The Central Board for Skills Certification to be set up by September 2016 to infuse quality into India’s skill development ecosystem.

65% of Indians are under the age of 35.
By 2025, almost 1 in 5 of the world’s working age population (18.3%) will be Indian.
In order to leverage India’s demographic dividend and prioritise skill development, a dedicated new Ministry for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) was set up, for the very first time, by the newly elected NDA government in November 2014 to steer and coordinate skill development efforts.
Skill India is anchored within this new Ministry.
MSDE inherited a highly fragmented ecosystem.
21 Central Government Ministries and departments were implementing over 50 skill training programmes, operating in silos.
Conflicting norms between schemes, poor monitoring mechanisms, varying assessment and certification systems and the absence of a coherent vision of success, limited the effectiveness of these initiatives.
Within just six months, key organizations in the skill training and entrepreneurship ecosystem were brought under the Ministry.
Both these policy initiatives were formally launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 15 July 2015.
The Mission seeks to converge, coordinate, implement and monitor skilling activities on a pan-India basis.
It brings key the stakeholders under the Central Government and the States together under one umbrella Mission with a three-tier structure, consisting of: the Governing Council for policy role, Steering Committee for coordination role and Mission Directorate (along with an Executive Committee) for execution.
The Governing Council of the Mission is headed by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, and is guided by his vision of a ‘Skilled India’.
Skill India has led to transformational change in India’s vocational training ecosystem.
Over the last one year, over 1.04 crore youth have been trained under the Mission.

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon,
The foundations of the United Nations were laid by the brave soldiers on the battlefields of Second World War.
More than 24000 lost their lives and nearly half of that went missing.
The legacy of that sacrifice is shared by three countries present here.
They remain today among the largest contributors to the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.
Over 180,000 Indian troops have participated in UN peacekeeping missions – more than from any other country.
India has participated in 48 of the 69 UN peacekeeping missions so far.
161 Indian peacekeepers have made the supreme sacrifice while serving in UN missions.
India was the first country to contribute a Female Formed Police Unit to UN Mission in Liberia.
India has been providing training to peacekeeping officers from a large number of countries.
Till date, we have trained nearly 800 officers from 82 countries.
I thank President Obama for hosting this Summit on Peacekeeping.
Mandates are ambitious; but, resources are often inadequate.
I would like to pay homage to the peacekeepers who have laid down their lives in defending the highest ideals of the United Nations.
It would be most fitting if the proposed memorial wall to the fallen peacekeepers is created quickly.
I know that India has enjoyed a special place in the heart of every Cypriot President.
Almost all of them have visited India.
In modern times, our relationship goes back to the pre-independence era, when our founding fathers supported the freedom struggle of Cyprus.
In 1974, India took a firm stand in support of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus .
Three force commanders from India served in this capacity, and it is heartening for me to know that all of them are fondly remembered in Cyprus.
I am aware of your initiative for resolving the Cyprus issue.
You have led from the front in trying to bring a new era of peace, development and security.
Not just for Cyprus, but for the whole region.
We wish you every success in your efforts.
Both of us believe that a reformed Security Council, reflective of the world as it is, and not as it was, is necessary to address the range of complex challenges facing the world today.
Excellency, in this context, I deeply appreciate your support for India’s claim for a permanent seat in an expanded UN Security Council.
The President and I also discussed ways to strengthen our partnership in other inter-governmental organizations and regimes.
Given its location, Cyprus appreciates the threat that terrorism poses to the global peace and stability.
The President and I discussed the need for creating a comprehensive global legal framework, particularly through early conclusion of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.

He said that today, the country would begin its march towards freedom from tax terrorism.
He described the imminent passage of the Bill as a victory not for any political party, but for Indian democracy.
He noted that one of them was a Lok Sabha MP and the other was a Rajya Sabha MP.
The Prime Minister said that the consensus over GST is proving that Rashtraneeti is above Rajneeti (national issues are above politics) in India.
He described the GST as one more pearl in the necklace of Ek Bharat – much on the lines of the Railways, the All India Services, and visions such as Bharat Net and Sagarmala.
With GST, we intend to bring uniformity in taxation, said the Prime Minister, adding that the consumer would be supreme in the new dispensation.
He said most of the things that can impact consumer inflation have been kept out of the ambit of GST.
He said GST would help reduce corruption in collection, as well as the cost of collection.
The Prime Minister asserted that small businesses will also gain tremendously from GST, and will feel more secure with GST.

Miscellaneous
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the establishment of Circuit Bench of Calcutta High Court at Jalpaiguri.
The Union Cabinet under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of the Technical Arrangement between India and Switzerland on the identification and return of Swiss and Indian Nationals and its implementation.
Conclusion of the Bilateral Technical Arrangement (BTA) has been linked to the Visa Free Agreement for holders of Diplomatic passports as a package deal.
The BTA essentially aims to formalise the existing procedure for cooperation on the return of irregular migrants between the two countries without introducing any additional obligations or exacting timeframes.
It is noteworthy that the estimated number of irregular migrants in Switzerland who are thought to be from India is less than 100.
If the BTA with Switzerland is approved as proposed, it would offer an opportunity to use the same as a model template for negotiations on the subject with other EU countries, which have been raising the issue regularly with us.
It would also help to leverage the Readmission Agreement to liberalise visa and work permit regimes for legitimate Indian travellers.
This has been envisaged as a key goal in the recently concluded India-EU Common Agenda on Migration and Mobility (CAMM).
The Cabinet also approved the introduction of a Bill in Parliament to repeal the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 and the State Bank of Hyderabad Act, 1956.
The merger is likely to result in recurring savings, estimated at more than Rs. 1,000 crore in the first year, through a combination of enhanced operational efficiency and reduced cost of funds.
Existing customers of subsidiary banks will benefit from access to SBI’s global network.
The merger will also lead to better management of high value credit exposures through focused monitoring and control over cash flows instead of separate monitoring by six different banks.
The acquisition under Section 35 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955 will result in the creation of a stronger merged entity.
This will minimize vulnerability to any geographic concentration risks faced by subsidiary banks.
It will create improved operational efficiency and economies of scale.
It will also result in improved risk management and unified treasury operations.
The MoU was signed on 8th April, 2.017.
The MoU between CERT-In and BGD e-Gov CIRT would be implemented through a duly set up Joint Committee on Cyber Security.

The Prime Minister of Denmark, H.E. Mr Lars Løkke Rasmussen, is visiting India on 18-19 January, 2019 for “Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit-2019” where Denmark is participating as a Partner Country.
Prime Minister Rasmussen is accompanied by a business delegation including CEOs of major Danish companies.
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Rasmussen held bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in Gandhinagar on 18 January 2019.
The two Prime Ministers had earlier met during the first India- Nordic summit in Stockholm in April 2018.
In the meeting, the two leaders deliberated upon various areas of bilateral cooperation and also exchanged views on multilateral issues of mutual interest.
They underscored the huge potential for expanding bilateral trade and investments between the two countries.
Denmark is a global leader in several niche technologies which are of relevance to India.
Mentioning that Denmark has skills, India has scale and world has the need for new technologies, PM Modi encouraged India and Denmark to establish a research platform where solutions could be found to global issues of concern such as food security, water management, climate change and sustainable development.
During the meeting, two MOUs were exchanged- MoU on Maritime Issues between the Ministry of Shipping of India and the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs of Denmark and MoU between Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Limited and the Danish Embassy in New Delhi to establish an Urban Living Lab in Panaji, Goa.
Around 130 Danish companies have invested in India in areas such as shipping, renewable energy, environment, agriculture and food processing and are keen to expand their engagements in other sectors like smart urban development and waste-to-energy.
Several major Danish companies are also present in Gujarat in shipping and renewable energy sectors.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) among Brazil, Russian Federation, India, China, South Africa, regarding Cooperation in the Social and Labour Sphere.
The MoU was signed on 3rd August, 2018 during BRICS Labour and Employment Ministers (LEM) Meeting.
In the MoU, the parties including India have agreed to cooperate and hold mutual events in the prominent areas viz. labour legislation and enforcement, protection of workers’ rights with focus on vulnerable groups, Employment and labour market policies, Professional education, skills and training and Social protection.
The Memorandum is not an International Treaty and does not create rights and obligations for the parties governed by international law.
This would facilitate member countries to share knowledge and also implement joint programmes on .matter of Labour and Employment, Social Security and Social dialogue.
This would also ensure networking of international Training Centre of International Labour Organisation (ILO) with the BRICS Network of Labour Institutes which includes V.V. Giri National Labour Institute of India.
This network would specifically focus on the theme of youth employment and research on new forms of employment.
This network will also explore new learning technologies, including virtual network to deepen cooperation, exchange of information and capacity building.
My dear fellow citizens,
Greetings from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the auspicious occasion of Independence Day.
We are fortunate to have in our cultural and historical heritage from a Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan.
From the ramparts of Red Fort, on behalf of our 125 crore countrymen, I bow and pay respects to all those men and women who have sacrificed their lives, who have undergone immense sufferings and made sacrifices for the independence, glory and pride of the country.
Sometimes, natural calamities are a big challenge for us.
A good monsoon contributes immensely to the prosperity of the country.
However, due to climate change, sometimes it turns into a natural calamity.
Several parts of the country faced natural calamities recently.
Besides our innocent children lost their lives in a hospital.
Our 125 crore countrymen stand shoulder to shoulder with them in this hour of crisis and grief.
I assure the countrymen that in this hour of crisis we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the wellbeing of all.
My dear countrymen, this year is a special year for independent India.
We commemorated 75 years of Quit India Movement last week.
This year we are also commemorating the centenary of Champaran Satyagrah and the Sabarmati Ashram.
The centenary of Lokmanya Tilak’s call “Swaraj is my birth right” falls this year as well.
It inspires us to dedicate ourselves to a cause for the country.
A collective resolve of the citizens was visible during 1942 to 1947 across the country which forced the British to Quit India within a span of five years.
We will have to exhibit the same resolve from now on in the 70th year of independence to 2022, the 75th year of independence.
We now have five years before we reach the 75th year of our independence.
Therefore, we have to take the country forward with a pledge to build a New India.
Then there was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who empowered his countrymen to weave the fabric of independence with cotton and spinning wheel.
The collective resolve and strength of the people got freedom for our country.
No one is small or big.
We have in our memory the story of squirrel which became an agent of change.
That’s why we must remember that no one among the 1.25 billion people is either small or big – everyone is equal.
If each one of us, irrespective of where he belongs to, strives with a new resolve, a new energy, a new strength, we can change the face of the country with our combined strength in the 75th year of our independence in 2022.
It will be the New India – a secure, prosperous and strong nation.
A New India where there is equal opportunity for all; where modern science and technology play an important role in bringing glory for the nation in the global arena.
That is why we should move forward with this spirit.
For these people, this is a decisive year of their lives.
They are going to be the creator of the destiny (Bhagya Vidhata) of our nation in the 21st century.
I heartily welcome all these youth, honour them and offer my respects to them.
You have an opportunity to shape the destiny of our country.
A proud nation invites you to become a part of its developmental journey.
We have to leave this ‘Chalta Hai’ attitude.
It is natural for our countrymen to think of our safety and security.
Be it Left-Wing-Extremism, be it terrorism, be it infiltrators, be it the elements fomenting trouble inside our country- the uniformed forces of our country have made extreme sacrifices.
And when the surgical strike was carried out, then the world had to acknowledge India’s capability and strength.
India’s security is our priority.
Be it our coast line or our borders, the space or the cyberspace, India is capable of ensuring its own security and strong enough to ward off any threats against the country.
My beloved countrymen,
Those who have looted the nation and looted the poor are not able to sleep peacefully today.
Due to this, the confidence of the hardworking and honest person is increasing.
An honest man now feels that his honesty matters.
The ‘One Rank – One Pension’ policy for our defence forces was stuck up for 30-40 years.
Our government implemented it.
When we fulfill the aspirations of our soldiers, then their morale goes high and their resolve to protect the nation grows manifold.
The country has many states and a Central Government.
The success of GST can be attributed to the hard work that has been put in to make it a success.
Technology has made it look like a miracle.
The global community is surprised how we were able to roll out GST in such a short time.
It is a reflection of our capability and helps in building the confidence and faith of the future generations.
Today roads are being built at twice the speed.
The railway tracks are being laid at double the speed.
More than 14 thousand villages that were hitherto shrouded in darkness even after Independence, have been provided with electricity.
More than 2 crore poor mothers and sisters are no longer using the fuel wood and using LPG gas stove NOW.
The poor tribals have gained faith in the system.
The interest on bank loans have been lowered.
If a person belonging to the middle-class wants to build his house, then he gets a loan at a lower rate of interest.
In this way, the country is moving forward and people are joining the movement.
The times have changed.
The government is determined to do all it says, like doing away with the interview process.
I can provide many such instances of Good Governance, simplifying the process of Governance.
By reiterating this we have enforced faster decision making.
And that is why 125 crore countrymen have been able to repose faith in our governance.
Dear Countrymen,
India today has gained in stature across the globe.
You will be happy to know that we are not alone in our fight against terrorism.
Many nations are proactively supporting us.
For the development and progress of Jammu & Kashmir, its prosperity, and fulfilment of the aspirations of the citizens, not only the J&K government, but we as responsible citizens also have a responsibility.
We are committed to restore the state to its former glory so as to experience the paradise that it was, once again.
On Kashmir there is rhetoric and politics.
But I am clear in my belief on how to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people.
Such is the legacy of 125 crore Indians.
Hence, neither by abuse nor by bullets, change will come by embracing all.
And we are moving forward with this resolve.
We shall take strict steps against terrorism.
There is no question of being soft on terrorism or terrorists.
The process of engagement can take place only by their joining the mainstream.
I deeply appreciate the efforts of security forces in curbing the Left Wing extremism which mobilized a lot of youth from these regions to surrender and joined the mainstream.
Security forces are keeping a tight vigil on our borders.
I am delighted to announce that today the Indian Government is launching a website which will give an account of the valour of the Gallantry Award winners.
A portal is also being launched which aims to provide the entire details of these brave hearts who have brought pride to the nation.
The story of sacrifices made will certainly inspire the younger generations.
With the help of technology, we are trying to promote honesty and transparency in the country.
With the intervention of technology, slowly we are trying to link Aadhaar with the system.
We have been successful in infusing transparency in the system.
People from around the world have appreciated this model and have been studying it.
A common man living thousands of kilometres away can now supply his products to the Government.
We have been successful in bringing transparency at various levels.
Implementation of Government schemes are gaining momentum.
When a work is delayed, it is not only the project that is delayed.
It is not a matter of expenditure of money.
When a work is stalled, the poor families are the ones who suffer the most.
We can reach the planet Mars within 9 months; we are capable of achieving that.
I review Government Projects every month.
My brothers and sisters,
When a country that is capable of reaching Mars within 9 months, how is it possible that it is not able to lay 70-72 Kilometres railway lines for 42 long years.
It sets in doubts in the minds of the poor.
We have taken care of all these things.
We have been striving to bring in the changes through technology.
Whether it is Geo-Technology or Space-Technology, we have tried to link all these technologies to bring in transformation.
You must have seen that there was a time when tension prevailed between the Centre and the States for Urea and Kerosene.
The Centre was like an elder brother while the State was treated like a younger brother.
I know the importance of the Chief Ministers and the State Governments.
Hence , we laid emphasis on Co-operative Federalism.
Now we are moving towards a Competitive Co-operative Federalism.
You must have seen that we are taking all the decisions together.
You may recall that one of our Prime Ministers in his address from the ramparts of Red Fort had talked about the poor state of affairs of the power supply companies of the country.
He expressed his concerns over the issue.
Today with the “UDAY” Yojana, we have worked together to resolve the issues with these power companies.
It is a concrete example of federalism in its real sense.
Whether it is GST or Smart City Project, whether it is Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or construction of toilets, or ease of doing business, all these are being accomplished by working together shoulder to shoulder with the States.
My dear fellow countrymen,
In the New India, the biggest strength is democracy.
However, democracy cannot be confined only to ballot boxes.
Lokmanya Tilak Ji had said “Swaraj is my birthright”.
The citizens should fulfil their duties and the Government too should discharge its responsibilities.
When we move from “Swaraj” to “Suraja”, the citizens do not lag behind.
For example, when I called upon the countrymen to give up gas subsidy, the nation responded as a whole.
I have spoken about cleanliness.
Now people are joining hands from every part of the country to take up this cleanliness drive forward.
When demonetization was announced, the world was surprised.
People thought that this was the end of Modi.
But the way our 125 crore countrymen had shown patience and faith, we were able to take one after another step in our drive against corruption.
Lal Bahadur Shastri had given the slogan “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.”
Our farmers have not looked back since then.
They are now producing record harvests and scaling new heights despite facing natural adversities.
There has been a record production of pulses this year.
My dear brothers and sisters,
India never had the tradition to import pulses and if it had to import on rare occasions, it was only a few thousand tons.
This year when they produced 16 lakh tons of pulses to provide nutrition to the poor, the government took the historic step of encouraging them by buying their produce.
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna has provided a security cover to our farmers.
Three years back, this scheme which was running under a different name earlier, covered only 3.25 crore farmers.
Now over a short span of three years more farmers have been brought under its ambit.
The number is soon going to touch the 5.75 crore mark.
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna aims to meet the demand of water of the farmers.
If my farmers get water, they can produce rich harvests from their fields.
That is why I had made some announcements from the ramparts of Red Fort on the last Independence Day.
Out of those, we have completed 21 projects and remaining 50 would be completed soon.
I have resolved to complete 99 big projects.
By completing those 99 big projects before 2019, we shall fulfill our commitment.
We cannot change the lot of our farmers until we hand hold him from procuring seeds to ensure that his produce reaches the market.
For this we need infrastructure and supply chain.
Every year vegetables, fruits and grains worth lakhs of crores of rupees are wasted.
In order to change the situation, the government has encouraged Foreign Direct Investment in food processing sector.
Due to this, systems shall be put in place that will ensure hand-holding of the farmers from supplying seeds to marketing his produce.
Such arrangements will usher in a new change in the lives of crores of our farmers.
The Government has launched several new initiatives in the employment related schemes and also in the manner in which the training is imparted for the development of human resource according to the needs of the 21st century.
We have launched a massive program to provide collateral free loans to the youth.
Our youth should become independent, he should get the employment, he should become the provider of employment.
Over the past three years, ‘Pradhanmantri Mudra Yojana’ has led to millions and millions of youth becoming self-dependent.
It’s not just that, one youth is providing employment to one, two or three more people.
We have asked 20 universities to decide their own destiny.
The government will not interfere in their functioning.
We have appealed to them and I am confident that the education institutions of our country will certainly come forward and make it a success.
Over the last three years, we have set up 6 IITs, 7 new IIMs and 8 new IIITs and we have also done the groundwork for linking the education with job opportunities.
My mothers and sisters, the women in the families seek employment in large numbers.
And therefore we have taken a very important step to reform the labour laws to provide them the employment opportunities in the night also.
Our mothers and sisters are an integral unit of our families.
Their contribution in making our future is extremely important.
And that is why we have decided to increase the paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from the earlier 12 weeks.
In the context of women empowerment, I’d like to honour those sisters who have been forced to lead a very difficult life due to ‘Triple Talaq’.
There is no recourse for them, and such victims of ‘Triple Talaq’ have launched a massive movement in the country.
They shook the conscience of the intellectual class of the country, the media of the country also helped them and a movement against ‘Triple Talaq’ was started in the country.
I heartily commend those sisters who have launched this movement, who have been fighting against the ‘Triple Talaq’ and I’m confident that the country will help them in this struggle.
The country will help these mothers and sisters in securing this right.
Sometimes in the name of faith, some people due to lack of patience end up destroying the social fabric.
This is the land of Gandhi and Buddha, we have to move forward taking everyone along.
This is a part of our country’s culture and tradition.
We have to successfully carry it forward, and that is why in the name of faith, violence cannot be allowed.
If something happens to a patient in a hospital and the hospital is burnt down; some accident happens and the vehicles are burnt down; people launch a movement and the public property is burnt down; is it for a free India?
It is the property of 125 crore Indians.
The country will never accept this.
And that is why I’d like to appeal to all the countrymen that at that time our motto was ‘Bharat Chodo’ and today’s slogan is ‘Bharat Jodo’.
In order to build a prosperous India, we need a strong economy, balanced development and next generation infrastructure.
Only then, we can realise the India of our dreams.
We have taken innumerable decisions over the past three years.
Some have been noticed, while the rest may not have been noticed.
But look at the working style of this government; when a train crosses a railway station and changes the track, the speed needs to be reduced from 60 to 30.
The speed of the train decreases while changing the track.
We are trying to put the whole country on a new track without decreasing the speed.
We have maintained the speed.
We have laid emphasis on infrastructure.
We have invested lot of funds for building the infrastructure – from modernization of the railway station in a small town, to build an Airport, to expand water-ways or roadways, to form a gas-grid or a water-grid or to lay down an optical fibre network.
We are emphasising on all types of modern infrastructure.
The prosperity of Eastern India is required for India’s forward movement into the 21st century.
It has tremendous potential, rich human resources, immense natural wealth, work force and it has the power to change lives.
We are devoting significant attention to eastern India- Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, and the Northeast.
These parts have to grow further.
These are abundant in natural resources and are striving hard to take the country to new heights.
Making India corruption-free is an important task and we are trying to provide impetus to it.
After forming the government, our first task was to constitute an SIT.
Today, after three years, I want to tell the countrymen proudly that we have confiscated black money worth Rs. 1.25 lakh crores, the culprits would be brought to book and forced to surrender.
Demonetization followed this move.
We have achieved several milestones through demonetization.
The hidden black money has been brought into the formal economy.
According to the research conducted by outside experts, about Rs.3 lakh crores that had never come into the banking system before, has been brought into the system after the demonetization.
More than Rs. 1.75 lakh crores deposited in the banks is under the scanner.
Black money worth Rs. 2 lakh crore had to be deposited in the banks and this system has forced them to be accountable.
It has also stopped the flow of black money.
In a way it has more than doubled.
Around 4.5 lakh people have now come forward and are trying to trade the right path after accepting their mistakes.
One lakh people, who had neither heard of Income Tax nor paid Income Tax, have now been forced to do so.
In our country, we tend to indulge in endless debates and discussions following the shutdown of companies.
People start speculating about economic meltdown and what not.
You will be surprised to know that black marketers used to own shell companies.
Post demonetization, the reports from data mining astonishingly revealed that there are 3 lakh shell companies dealing in Hawala transactions.
Can anyone imagine?
Out of these 3 lakh shell companies, registration of 1.75 lakh companies were cancelled.
Even if five companies shut shop in India, there is huge public outcry.
And here, we have closed one lakh Seventy five thousand companies.
The looters of nation’s wealth will have to answer.
We have accomplished this task.
You will be surprised to know that there are some shell companies operating from a single address.
As many as 400 companies have been found to be operating from one address.
There was no one to question them.
There was a total collusion.
Therefore, Brothers and sisters, I have waged a big war against corruption and black money.
We are fighting corruption – for the bright future of India and the wellbeing of our people.
We have taken several steps and I am sure that post GST, it will increase further and bring in transparency.
Today a truck driver on an average is able to save 30% of his travel time from one point to another after GST was introduced.
Hundreds of crores of rupees have been saved due to removal of check posts.
This amounts to 30% increase in his efficiency.
Can you imagine what it means to accomplish 30% more efficiency in the Indian transportation sector?
GST has brought this revolutionary change.
Today due to demonetization, banks have enough liquidity.
Banks are reducing their interest rates.
Even a common man is able to access inflow of funds through Mudra.
He is getting opportunities to stand on his feet.
The middle class and the underprivileged who aspire to have their own homes someday, are getting loans from the banks at low interest rates.
Such moves are giving a fillip to the economic growth of the country.
Time has changed.
We are in the 21st Century.
Our country boasts of the world’s largest youth population.
India is known in the world for its prowess in IT and Digital World.
Should we still remain in the old mind-set?
There was a time when leather coins were in vogue, but gradually they ceased to exist.
Today we have paper-currency.
Slowly this paper-currency will be replaced by the digital currency.
We should lead from the front to make a move towards Digital transactions.
We should adopt BHIM App for transactions and make it a part of our economic activities.
We should also work through prepaid systems.
I am happy that there has been an increase in Digital transactions.
It has increased by 34% compared to last year while the prepaid transactions have gone up by 44%.
We should move towards a less-cash economy.
My Dear Countrymen, some schemes of the Government are meant for ensuring savings for the common man.
There used to be a lot of expenditure on operations and stents.
We are striving to make it possible for knee operations as well.
We are striving to minimize this expenditure for the poor and the middle class.
Earlier there used to be Dialysis only at the State capitals.
Now we have decided to open Dialysis Centres at district level.
We have already opened this facility in 350 to 400 districts where free Dialysis services are available for the poor.
Crores of RuPay Cards are now available in the country.
When all the cards will be operational, it will be the largest number of cards in the world.
It implies that, if we don’t accomplish a work within the stipulated time then we shall not be able to get the desired results.
So for the ‘Team India’, for the 125 crore countrymen, we have to take the pledge to achieve the goal by 2022.
We will do it with dedication to see a great, majestic India by 2022.
Together we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without worry.
They will earn double by 2022 of what they are earning today.
And that is why my dear fellow countrymen, we will together strive to move ahead in this march towards development.
Let all of us march together with the dream of a building an India of grandeur and majesty as we wait for the 75th year of independence after completing 70 years of Independence in the next five years.
With this thought in mind I once again bow my head before the heroes of our freedom movement.
I bow my head before the new confidence and passion of my 125 crore countrymen and I call upon Team India to march on with this new pledge.
With this thought I convey my hearty congratulations to all of you.

I have a question “how to guide people that burning of farm remains or straw not only destroys the micro organisms of the soil but also contributes to the pollution in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana.
They have not been trained about it.
And to save us from rising temperatures, the first step is “energy conservation.

LETTER OF INTENT between Sports Authority of India and University of Tsukuba, Japan
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed a Students’ Convention on the occasion of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Centenary Celebrations, and 125th Year of Swami Vivekananda’s Chicago Address, at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi.
The 9/11 of 1893 was about love, harmony and brotherhood, he added.
The Prime Minister said that Swami Vivekananda raised his voice against the social evils that have entered our society.
He recalled that Swami Vivekananda said that only rituals will not connect an individual to divinity; he said that ‘Jan Seva’ is ‘Prabhu Seva.’
Swami Vivekananda did not believe in sermonising, the Prime Minister said.
The correspondence between Swami Vivekananda and Jamsetji Tata will show the concern Swami ji had towards India’s self-reliance, the Prime Minister said.
Both knowledge and skills are equally important, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said, that people now say that the 21st century is Asia’s century.
But long ago, Swami Vivekananda had given the concept of ‘One Asia,’ and said that the solutions to the world’s problems will come from Asia.
There is no better place for creativity and innovation than university campuses, the Prime Minister said, adding that campuses should organize days to celebrate the culture and language of various States, to strengthen the spirit of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.”
India is changing, India’s standing at the global stage is rising and this is due to Jan Shakti, the Prime Minister said.
I am very happy to be here at the inauguration of the World Sustainable Development Summit.
This summit is a re-inforcement of India’s commitment to a sustainable planet, for ourselves and for future generations.
As a nation, we are proud of our long history and tradition of harmonious co-existence between man and nature.
Respect for nature is an integral part of our value system.
Our traditional practices contribute to a sustainable lifestyle.
We are just the trustees or managers of this wealth.
Mahatma Gandhi too, advocated this trusteeship philosophy.
Over the years, the World Sustainable Development Summit has spread consciousness about our actions to preserve the purity of Mother Earth to all parts of the world.
India believes in growth but is also committed to protecting the environment.
Friends, it was with this thought that India, along with France, initiated the International Solar Alliance.
It already has one hundred and twenty one members.
It is perhaps, the single most important global achievement after Paris.
We are also on track to meet the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution.
While we are doing everything that is required of us, we expect that others also join in to fulfil their commitments based on Common but Differentiated Responsibility and equity.
We must also stress on climate justice for all vulnerable populations.
We in India are focused on Ease of living –through Good Governance, Sustainable Livelihood and through Cleaner Environment.
The campaign for clean India has moved from the streets of Delhi to every nook and corner of the country.
Cleanliness leads to better hygiene, better health, better working conditions and there-by better income and life.
We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients, instead of burning them.
We are also happy to host the 2018 World Environment Dayton highlight our commitment and our continuing partnership to make the world a cleaner place.
We also recognize the need to tackle the issue of water availability, which is becoming a major challenge.
That is why we have introduced the massive Namami Gange initiative.
This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.
Our country is primarily agrarian.
The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojanahas been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water.
India has a fairly decent report card on bio-diversity conservation.
With only two point four percent of the world’s land area, India harbors 7-8 percent of the recorded species diversity, while supporting nearly eighteen percent of human population.
India has gained international recognition for ten out of its eighteen Biosphere reserves under UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere programme.
Our mission of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is an extension of this philosophy.
Through this philosophy, we are ensuring that some of our most deprived areas experience social and economic progress on par with others.
In this day and age, access to electricity and clean cooking solutions are basics that every person must be provided with.
These form the core of any country’s economic development.
Keeping this in view we have launched two far-reaching initiatives- Ujjwala and Saubhagya.
From the time that they were launched, these schemes have already impacted the lives of millions.
With these twin programs, the time when mothers would fetch dry wood from forests or prepare cow dung cakes, to feed their families will be gone soon.
Soon too, the images of traditional firewood stoves will only remain a picture in our social history texts.
Similarly, through Saubhagya Scheme, we are working towards electrifying every house-hold in this country, mostly by the end of this year.
We recognize that only a healthy nation can lead the process of development.
Keeping this in mind, we have launched the world’s largest government funded health scheme.
The programme will support hundred million poor families.
Our ‘Housing for All’ and ‘Power for All ’initiatives also stem from this same agenda of providing the basic amenities of life to those who cannot afford them.
Our development needs are enormous.
Our poverty or prosperity will have direct impact on the global poverty or prosperity.
People in India have waited too long for access to modern amenities and means of development.
We have committed to complete this task sooner than anticipated.
However, we have also said that we will do all this in a cleaner and greener way.
To give you just a few examples.
As the world’s fastest growing major economy, our energy needs are immense.
However, we have planned to draw One 175 Giga-Watts of energy from renewable sources by 2022.This includes 100 Giga-Watts from Solar Energy and another 75Giga-Watts from Wind and other sources.
We have added more than14 Giga-Watts to solar energy generation which was just about three Giga-Watts three years back.
With this, we are already the fifth largest producer of solar energy in the world.
With growing urbanization our transportation needs are growing too.
But we are focusing on mass transportation systems especially metro rail systems.
Even for cargo movement to long distances, we have started working on national water-way systems.
Each of our states is preparing an action plan against climate change.
The developed world can help us achieve them faster.
Successful climate action needs access to financial resources and technology.
Technology can help countries like India develop sustainably and enable the poor to benefit from it.
We need to understand that this planet, our Mother Earth, is one.
And so, we should rise above our trivial differences of race, religion, and power, and act as one to save her.
With our deep rooted philosophy of co-existence with nature and co-existence with each other, we invite you to join us in the journey of making this planet a more safe and sustainable place.
I wish the World Sustainable Development Summit a great success.
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) between India and Japan in the field of food processing sector.
Before arriving on the stage here, I visited an exhibition of stalls set up by Self-Help Groups comprising women from all eight North Eastern States.
The artefacts and products displayed in this exhibition are indeed impressive.
The Government is committed to the development of Self Help Groups, particularly Women Self Help Groups.
Keeping this in mind, in December 2015, the Union Cabinet approved a Special Package Fund for the North Eastern States.
The objective is to accelerate the implementation of the National Rural Livelihood Mission, so as to cover two-thirds of all rural households in North Eastern States by 2023-24.
Today, I unveiled a plaque for the foundation stone of a football stadium.
We are all aware of the love that the people of the North-East, and especially Meghalaya, have for Football.
We are all familiar with famous football players such as Eugeneson Lyngdoh, Aibor Khongjee, and Marlangki Suting.
They have done both the country and the State proud, by representing India in International Tournaments, and their clubs in the Indian Super League.
I am told that the State Government’s Meghalaya Mission Football aims at detecting talent at the grass-root level and providing support for grooming and nurturing promising children and youngsters as professional footballers.
I am sure that the football stadium being constructed at a cost of 38 crore rupees with the support of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, will go a long way towards fulfilling this objective.
Next year, that is in 2017, India is hosting the Under-17 FIFA World Cup.
Meghalaya has a large number of football clubs and associations.
Perhaps, you can organize competitive local tournaments and lead the way for other parts of the country, to build a series of major events leading to the Under-17 World Cup.
We all know Cherrapunji, for being the place that receives the highest rainfall in the World.
Today, another feather has been added to its cap.
The Doppler Weather Radar at Cherrapunji has been dedicated to the Nation.
I congratulate the Indian Space Research Organization; Bharat Electronics Ltd.; and the Indian Meteorological Department for setting up this Radar in Cherrapunji.
The North East, a land of beauty and adventure, has been hit by several natural calamities in the recent past, on account of heavy rain and landslides.
This Weather Radar System will enable better weather forecasts, especially for the North Eastern region.
This should help in minimizing the threat posed by extreme weather conditions.
Earlier today, I had an opportunity to participate in the North Eastern Council Meeting and interact with the Governors and Chief Ministers of this region.
This gave me an opportunity to get a glimpse of the development work being carried out in the North East.
A lot is being done.
Much more still needs to be done.
My Government has been proactively following the ‘Act East Policy’.
I consider the North Eastern Region as the Gateway to South-East Asia.
As part of this policy, it is our mission to upgrade the infrastructure in Road, Rail, Telecom, Power and Waterways in the region.
And today, as part of that mission, I have flagged off three new trains.
We are committed to connect all North Eastern States with the country’s railway network.
Since the formation of the NDA Government at the Centre, we have spent more than Ten Thousand Crore Rupees for development of the railway network in the North East.
The Railway Ministry plans to spend more than Five Thousand Crore Rupees during the current year for the same.
In November, 2014, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh were brought on the rail map of India.
Recently, Agartala in Tripura has been connected with a broad gauge railway line.
Today is indeed a red letter day in the history of the North-East.
Broad Gauge Passenger Trains will now connect the States of Manipur and Mizoram.
Today, Kamakhya in Guwahati has been directly connected with Vaishno Devi in Katra, near Jammu.
We are opening up both Road and Rail routes to our neighbouring countries.
This will give a boost to the economic development of the region.
The Union Government has incorporated a special Corporation named ‘National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation’ in July 2014, for the development of Highways in the North Eastern region.
This Corporation is constructing three new bridges on Brahmaputra River.
It is implementing 34 road projects in the North Eastern Region to construct around 1,000 kilometers of roads at a total cost of over Ten Thousand Crore Rupees.
The North East Road Sector Development Scheme has been started, with an aim to connect every district in the region with a National Highway.
The development of inland waterways has been given a boost.
The Union Government has declared 19 Waterways in the North East as National Waterways.
We are committed to provide 24 by 7 electricity to all the people.
Keeping this in mind, the Union Government is making heavy investment in the power sector.
Two projects covering all the eight North Eastern States are being implemented at a cost of around Ten Thousand Crore Rupees for improving power transmission.
The commissioning of the Bishwanath-Chariyali to Agra transmission network has made available 500 Megawatts of power in the region from outside.
Out of the 18,000 unelectrified villages in the country, we have already connected more than 7000 villages with electricity.
The Government is implementing a comprehensive Telecom Plan for the North Eastern Region at a cost of over 5,300 crore rupees.
Agartala has become the third city in India to be connected with an International Gateway through Cox Bazar of Bangladesh.
This has improved telecom connectivity and will give a boost to the economic development of the region.
During my last visit to Gangtok a few months ago, Sikkim was declared as the First Organic State in the country.
Other North Eastern States can take a lead from Sikkim to become Organic States.
In fact, the North Eastern Region has the potential to become Organic Food Basket of India.
This will increase the income of the farmers.
Today one need not go through the tedious scrutiny of a banker to get small loans.
The Union Government has launched the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, under which collateral free loans are provided to small business entrepreneurs.
During 2015-16, more than three crore forty eight lakh entrepreneurs have been sanctioned loans worth more than one lakh thirty seven thousand crore rupees.
Similarly, 93 Lakh bank accounts have been opened in the region under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.
The Textile Sector provides employment to most people after agriculture.
Within the sector, it is the apparel segment that provides maximum employment.
A large number of women are employed in the segment.
In order to boost industrial activity and employment under the North East Region Textile Promotion scheme, one apparel and garment making centre is being set up in each of the eight states at a cost of Rupees One Hundred and Forty Five Crores.
Meghalaya has a distinct historical, cultural and ethnic heritage.
It is blessed with natural beauty and wildlife.
There is no reason for a tourist to not want to visit Meghalaya.
There is a tremendous opportunity for tourism, as well as adventure tourism, in the North Eastern Region, particularly, Meghalaya.
We need to develop Tourist Circuits by providing better facilities to tourists, in terms of improved road connectivity, hotels, and cleanliness.
The Union Government has launched a new scheme of Swadesh Darshan, under which it is developing Tourist Circuits in the country.
One such circuit is proposed for the North East.
Less than two years ago, on 2nd October, 2014, the Union Government started its journey to create Swachh Bharat by October 2019, as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, ‘The Father of the Nation’.
In exactly one year, from 15th August, 2014 to 15th August, 2015, under the Swachh Bharat – Swachh Vidyalay Programme, we have constructed four lakh seventeen thousand toilets in over two lakh schools.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is a public movement for cleanliness.
The biggest beneficiaries of this movement are the poorest of the poor.
I request all of you to actively participate in the movement and ensure an open defecation free society and clean environment.
I am happy to note that the traditions of hygiene and cleanliness in the region got a boost with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Mawlyynong village in Meghalaya, the cleanest village, and the entire state of Sikkim, including Gangtok, have become major tourist attractions.
I would like to congratulate all the winners of the run with the theme ‘North East leads the way – Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’.
I congratulate the North Eastern Council for organizing the run.
Gangtok deserves applause for being ranked the cleanest city of the North East.
Congratulations to the people of Meghalaya for hosting the North Eastern Council Plenary Meeting in Shillong.
I also express my gratitude to all of you for giving me the opportunity for a wonderful interaction.

I had learnt to find out the better side of human nature and to enter men’s heart.
I realized that the true function of a lawyer is to unite the parties involved in a dispute.
The lesson was so indelibly burnt into me that the large part of my time during the twenty years of my practice as a lawyer was occupied in bringing about private compromises of hundreds of cases.
I lost nothing thereby, not even money and certainly not my soul.”
India is today the fastest growing major economy, and one of the most attractive destinations for FDI.
This will further boost domestic demand, create more opportunities for Indian business and drive job creation.
India is experiencing a digital revolution.
This is bridging the digital and economic divide in Indian society in general; and rural society in particular.
Innovative business models and app-based start-ups have instilled a spirit of enterprise among Indians.
Yesterday’s job seekers are becoming today’s job creators.
The legal profession is also opening up to the promises of the digital world.
And that commercial disputes will be resolved efficiently.
A robust legal framework backed by a vibrant arbitration culture is essential.
Further, in harmony with the Bankruptcy Code, we have amended the SARFAESI and DRT Acts this year to suit the changing credit landscape and augment ease of doing business.
Common citizens as well as businesses repose immense faith in the integrity of the judicial process.
Our Government has taken various initiatives to improve the judicial infrastructure and administration.
In ancient India, there were several mechanisms for settlement of disputes between the parties.
These included the Kulani, or village council; Sreni, or corporation; and Puga, or assembly.
Likewise, commercial matters were decided by Mahajans and Chambers.
Today, corporates and financial institutions want legal experts who can help close business deals and transactions without any disputes and litigations.
If a dispute arises, corporates want to resolve them quickly through arbitration, without going to courts.
Alternative dispute resolution processes also preserve personal and business relationships that might otherwise be damaged by the adversarial process.
Creation of a vibrant ecosystem for institutional arbitration, is one of the foremost priorities of our Government.
Recently, major amendments have been made to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.
This has made the arbitration process easy, timely and hassle-free.
Our law is based on the UNCITRAL model law.
The objective is to ensure that in normal circumstances, arbitral tribunal makes its award within 12 months.
Even the appointment of the arbitrator has to be decided by the Court within a period of 60 days.
However, great opportunities pose great challenges.
India also has a large number of retired judges, engineers, and scientists who can function as competent arbitrators in various fields.
We also need professionally run arbitral institutions which can deliver international standards of services at reasonable costs to businesses in India.
We welcome internationally recognized institutions in this effort.
We must deliberate on ways and means to supplement the efforts of the judiciary and arbitration mechanisms.
Mediation is one such mechanism, the potential of which has not been utilized much in the country.
We need to promote India globally as an arbitration hub.
As Roscoe Pound famously remarked, “The law must be stable but it must not stand still.”
We need to take inspiration from beyond our shores.
This conference has provided the ideal platform to deliberate upon the crucial regulatory, policy and mindset reforms on this.
I am sure, the deliberations here shall help in further strengthening Arbitration in India and set a milestone in positioning India as a global hub for arbitration amongst international practitioners, corporate houses and the legal fraternity.
We look forward to effectively implementing your recommendations.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telephone call today to H. E. Mr. Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China, to congratulate him on his re-election as the President of the People’s Republic of China.
The two leaders agreed that as two major powers growing rapidly, bilateral relations between India and China are vital for the realization of 21st Century as ‘Asian Century’.
The two leaders also agreed to continue their close consultations on regional and international issues of mutual interest.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of Lok Sabha MP Mahant Chand Nath.
The Prime Minister said,”Saddened by the demise of LS MP from Alwar, Mahant Chand Nath ji.
He will be remembered for his rich social work.
My deepest condolences.”
The Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented Prime Minister of Israel Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu replicas of 2 sets of relics from Kerala that are regarded as key artifacts in the long Jewish history in India.
They comprise two different sets of copper plates that are believed to have been inscribed in 9-10th century C.E.
The first set of copper plates is a cherished relic for the Cochini Jews in India.
It is regarded as a charter describing the grant of hereditary royal privileges and prerogatives by the Hindu King, Cheraman Perumal (often identified as Bhaskara Ravi Varma) to the Jewish leader Joseph Rabban.
Local Jews once placed in each coffin a handful of earth from Shingli/Cranganore that was remembered as a holy place & a “second Jerusalem”.
The replica of these plates was made possible with the cooperation of the Paradesi Synagogue in Mattancherry, Kochi.
The second set of copper plates is believed to be the earliest documentation of the history of Jewish trade with India.
These plates describe the grant of land and tax privileges by the local Hindu ruler to a church and oversight of trade in Kollam to West Asian and Indian trading associations.
West Asian association included Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, as also a group of Jews who signed in Judeo-Persian and possibly also in Arabic and Pahlavi (Middle Persian).
The plates bear their signatures that appear to have been cut into the plates by a local workman unfamiliar with the script.
The replica of these plates was made possible with the cooperation of Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Thiruvalla, Kerala.
In addition, Prime Minister also presented PM Netanyahu a Torah scroll donated by the Paradesi Jewish community in Kerala.
Handwritten over a hundred years ago, the scroll had been dedicated to the Paradesi Synagogue in Kochi that had been built in 1568.
The Torah is enclosed on wooden staves in a wooden case adorned with silver sheets and a metal crown covered in gold sheets in floral ornament style, bearing motifs typical of lamps and decorations of south India.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
Thank you for your friendship, your leadership of India-Singapore partnership and a better future for the region.
I am also happy to be here in a special year.
In a land-mark year of India’s relationship with ASEAN.
In January, we had the unique honour of hosting ten ASEAN leaders on our Republic Day.
The ASEAN-India Summit was a testimony of our commitment to ASEAN, and to our Act East policy.
For thousands of years, Indians have turned to the East.
Not just to see the Sun rise, but also to pray for its light to spread over the entire world.
Because, this new age of promise is also caught in shifting plates of global politics and the fault lines of history.
And, when they embrace diversity at home, they seek an inclusive world outside.
For India, though, Singapore means more.
It was cast in peace and friendship, religion and culture, art and commerce, language and literature.
These human links have lasted, even as the tides of politics and trade saw their ebb and flow.
Over the past three decades, we have re-claimed that heritage to restore our role and relationships in the region.
For India, no region now receives as much attention as this.
And, for good reasons.
Oceans had an important place in Indian thinking since pre-Vedic times.
Thousands of years ago, the Indus Valley Civilisation as well as Indian peninsula had maritime trade.
Oceans and Varuna – the Lord of all Waters – find a prominent place in the world’s oldest books- the Vedas.
In ancient Puranas, written thousands of years ago, the geographical definition of India is with reference to the seas: Uttaron Yat Samudrasya meaning, the land which lies to the north of the seas.
Lothal, in my home state Gujarat, was among the world’s oldest ports.
Even today there are remains of a dock.
No wonder Gujaratis are enterprising and travel widely even today!
The Indian Ocean has shaped much of India’s history.
It now holds the key to our future.
The ocean carries 90% of India’s trade and our energy sources.
It is also the life line of global commerce.
The Indian Ocean connects regions of diverse cultures and different levels of peace and prosperity.
It also now bears ships of major powers.
Both raise concerns of stability and contest.
To the East, the Malacca Strait and South China Sea connect India to the Pacific and to most of our major partners – ASEAN, Japan, Republic of Korea, China and the Americas.
Our trade in the region is growing rapidly.
And, a significant part of our overseas investments flow in this direction.
ASEAN alone accounts for over 20%.
Our interests in the region are vast, and our engagement is deep.
In the Indian Ocean region, our relationships are becoming stronger.
We are also helping build economic capabilities and improve maritime security for our friends and partners.
We promote collective security through forums like Indian Ocean Naval Symposium.
We are advancing a comprehensive agenda of regional co-operation through Indian Ocean Rim Association.
And, we also work with partners beyond the Indian Ocean Region to ensure that the global transit routes remain peaceful and free for all.
Three years ago, in Mauritius, I described our vision in one word – Sagar, which means ocean in Hindi.
South-east Asia is our neighbour by land and sea.
With each Southeast Asian country, we have growing political, economic and defence ties.
With ASEAN, from dialogue partners, we have become strategic partners over the course of 25 years.
We pursue our relations through annual summits and 30 dialogue mechanisms.
But even more through a shared vision for the region, and the comfort and familiarity of our old links.
Our ties with Japan – from economic to strategic – have been completely transformed.
It is a partnership of great substance and purpose that is a corner-stone of India’s Act East Policy.
There is a strong momentum in our cooperation with Republic of Korea.
And, there is a fresh energy in our partnerships with Australia, as also New Zealand.
With several of our partners, we meet in formats of three or more.
The meetings of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation, or FIPIC, have bridged the distance of geography through shared interests and action.
Beyond East and Southeast Asia, our partnerships are strong and growing.
At the same time, India’s global strategic partnership with the United States has overcome the hesitations of history and continues to deepen across the extraordinary breadth of our relationship.
It has assumed new significance in the changing world.
And, an important pillar of this partnership is our shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific Region.
No other relationship of India has as many layers as our relations with China.
We are the world’s two most populous countries and among the fastest growing major economies.
Our cooperation is expanding.
Trade is growing.
And, we have displayed maturity and wisdom in managing issues and ensuring a peaceful border.
I firmly believe that, Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other’s interests.
India has a growing partnership with Africa, propelled through mechanisms such as India-Africa Forum Summits.
At its core are cooperation based on Africa’s requirements, and a history of warmth and mutual respect.
We have more trade agreements in this part of the world than in any other.
We have Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements with Singapore, Japan and South Korea.
We have Free Trade Agreements with ASEAN and Thailand.
My friend President Widodo and I upgraded India-Indonesia relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
Among other shared interests, we have a common vision for maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.
On way from Indonesia, I stopped over briefly in Malaysia to meet one of ASEAN’s most senior leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir.
India Armed Forces, especially our Navy, are building partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region for peace and security, as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
We work with partners like Vietnam to build mutual capabilities.
India conducts Malabar Exercise with the United States and Japan.
A number of regional partners join in India’s Exercise Milan in the Indian Ocean, and participate in RIMPAC in the Pacific.
Distinguished members of the audience, Back home, our principal mission is transforming India to a New India by 2022, when Independent India will be 75 years young.
We will sustain growth of 7.5 to 8% per year.
As our economy grows, our global and regional integration will increase.
But, the future we seek to build needs a stable bedrock of peace.
And, this is far from certain.
And, the future looks less certain.
For all our progress, we live on the edge of uncertainty, of unsettled questions and unresolved disputes; contests and claims; and clashing visions and competing models.
We see growing mutual insecurity and rising military expenditure; internal dislocations turning into external tensions; and new fault lines in trade and competition in the global commons.
Above all, we see assertion of power over re-course to international norms.
In the midst of all this, there are challenges that touch us all, including the un-ending threat of terrorism and extremism.
This is a world of inter-dependent fortunes and failures.
And, no nation can shape and secure it on its own.
It is a world that summons us to rise above divisions and competition to work together.
Is that possible?
It is possible.
I see ASEAN as an example and inspiration.
ASEAN represents the greatest level of diversity of culture, religion, language, governance and prosperity of any grouping in the world.
It was born when Southeast Asia was a frontline of global competition, a theatre of a brutal war and a region of uncertain nations.
Yet, today, ASEAN has united ten countries behind a common purpose.
ASEAN unity is essential for a stable future for this region.
I am convinced that ASEAN can integrate the broader region.
In many ways, ASEAN is already leading the process.
In doing so, it has laid the foundation of the Indo-Pacific Region.
The East Asia Summit and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – two important initiatives of ASEAN – embrace this geography.
The Indo-Pacific is a natural region.
It is also home to a vast array of global opportunities and challenges.
I am increasingly convinced with each passing day that the destinies of those of us who live in the region are linked.
Today, we are being called to rise above divisions and competition to work together.
The ten countries of South East Asia connect the two great oceans in both the geographical and civilizational sense.
Inclusiveness, openness and ASEAN centrality and unity, therefore, lie at the heart of the new Indo-Pacific.
India does not see the Indo-Pacific Region as a strategy or as a club of limited members.
Nor as a grouping that seeks to dominate.
And by no means do we consider it as directed against any country.
A geographical definition, as such, cannot be.
India’s vision for the Indo-Pacific Region is, therefore, a positive one.
And, it has many elements.
Southeast Asia is at its centre.
That is the vision that will always guide India, as we seek to cooperate for an architecture for peace and security in this region.
We believe that our common prosperity and security require us to evolve, through dialogue, a common rules-based order for the region.
And, it must equally apply to all individually as well as to the global commons.
These rules and norms should be based on the consent of all, not on the power of the few.
It also means that when nations make international commitments, they must uphold them.
This is the foundation of India’s faith in multilateralism and regionalism; and, of our principled commitment to rule of law.
When we all agree to live by that code, our sea lanes will be pathways to prosperity and corridors of peace.
We will also be able to come together to prevent maritime crimes, preserve marine ecology, protect against disasters and prosper from blue economy.
This region, and all of us, have benefitted from globalisation.
Indian food is among the best examples of these benefits!
But, there is growing protectionism – in goods and in services.
What we seek is a level playing field for all.
India stands for open and stable international trade regime.
That is what we expect from Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
RCEP must be comprehensive, as the name suggests, and the principles declared.
It must have a balance among trade, investment and services.
Connectivity is vital.
It does more than enhance trade and prosperity.
India has been at the crossroads for centuries.
We understand the benefits of connectivity.
There are many connectivity initiatives in the region.
If these have to succeed, we must not only build infrastructure, we must also build bridges of trust.
And for that, these initiatives must be based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, consultation, good governance, transparency, viability and sustainability.
And, we are important stake-holders in New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
All of this is possible, if we do not return to the age of great power rivalries I have said this before: Asia of rivalry will hold us all back.
Asia of cooperation will shape this century.
So, each nation must ask itself: Are its choices building a more united world, or forcing new divisions?
It is a responsibility that both existing and rising powers have.
Competition is normal.
But, contests must not turn into conflict; differences must not be allowed to become disputes.
Distinguished members of the audience, It is normal to have partnerships on the basis of shared values and interests.
India, too, has many in the region and beyond.
We will work with them, individually or in formats of three or more, for a stable and peaceful region.
And, when we can work together, we will be able to meet the real challenges of our times.
We will be able to protect our planet.
That is the foundation of our civilizational ethos – of pluralism, co-existence, open-ness and dialogue.
The ideals of democracy that define us as a nation also shape the way we engage the world.
So, it translates into five S in Hindi: Samman (respect); Samvad (dialogue); Sahayog (cooperation), Shanti (peace), and Samriddhi (prosperity).
It’s easy to learn these words!
We will keep our economy open and our engagement transparent.
We will share our resources, markets and prosperity with our friends and partners.
We will seek a sustainable future for our planet, as through the new International Solar Alliance together with France and other partners.
This is how we wish ourselves and our partners to proceed in this vast region and beyond.
The ancient wisdom of the region is our common heritage.
Lord Buddha’s message of peace and compassion has connected us all.
Together, we have contributed much to human civilisation.
And, we have been through the devastation of war and the hope of peace.
We have seen the limits of power.
And, we have seen the fruits of cooperation.
It summons us to a higher purpose: to rise above a narrow view of our interests and recognise that each of us can serve our interests better when we work together as equals in the larger good of all nations.
I am here to urge all to take that path.

Which Indian would not be proud of our soldiers?
And, you being a soldier’ daughter should naturally take pride in that.
It guarantees fundamental rights to each & every citizen, whether underprivileged or oppressed, backward or deprived, a tribal or a woman.
After Independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions; be it the liberation struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pak war.
This is a day to feel proud of and show respect to our country’s armed forces.
Experiences and acts of valour of those from the armed forces who are our neighbours or acquaintances and related videos and pictures can be posted on hash-tag armed forces flag day (#armedforcesflagday).
More information about sending in monetary contributions can be had on kbs.gov.in.
You can also make cashless payment for this.
But the moment winter sets in, we all have experienced that we don’t like coming out of our quilts one bit.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters are firm in their resolve; they are competent, capable, courageous and determined.
‘Hello Mr. Prime Minister, I am Neerja Singh calling from Kanpur.
And I will definitely share the positive thoughts that arrive on #positiveindia (hashtag positive India) with the rest of our denizens in the next episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat.’
Many – Many thanks!
Monsoon Session of the Parliament gets underway today.
After summer, the advent of first rain brings in a fresh new smell into the soil.
The GST spirit is about growing stronger together.
Quit India Movement turns 75 years on 9th August, 2017.
Therefore, it is natural that the public attention will be focused more on the Monsoon Session this year.
As the Monsoon Session of Parliament gets underway, we salute our farmers who have been ensuring food security for the country with their hard work.
It is my firm belief that the Monsoon Session will provide an opportunity to all the Political Parties and the MPs to enter into a dialogue of the highest quality with value addition for taking major decisions in the larger national interest together.

I encourage all of you to see for yourselves the direction that India is taking.
Let me take this opportunity to share my thoughts.
In a year’s time, Make in India has become the biggest brand that India has ever created.
Both within and outside the country, it has captured the imagination of people, institutions, industries, media and the political leadership.
This is because:
· It reflects our collective desire to engage in productive activities;
· It also reflects the global need to produce things at lower cost.
· It is forcing us to make corrections and increase efficiency;
· It has emboldened us to integrate with the world on equal terms.
Let me give you some concrete examples of what we have done:
Today, India is perhaps the most open country for FDI.
Most of the FDI sectors have been put on automatic approval route.
Our FDI inflows have gone up by 48 per cent since the day my Government came into office.
In fact, FDI inflow in December, 2015 was the highest ever in this country.
This is, at a time, when global FDI has fallen substantially.
We have carried out a number of corrections on the taxation front.
We have said that we will not resort to retrospective taxation.
And I repeat this commitment once again.
We are also swiftly working towards making our tax regime transparent, stable and predictable.
We have laid all round emphasis on Ease of Doing Business.
In the manufacturing sector, we have taken decisive steps to simplify processes and rationalize provisions.
This includes licensing, cross-border trade, security and environmental clearances.
We have announced attractive schemes in several sectors including electronics and textiles.
We have made substantial policy corrections in the defence sector.
From licensing to offset regime and export regime, we have given what the defence industry was looking for.
Smooth and transparent allocation of natural resources is another example.
The advantages from this are two-fold: On one hand the production of such resources has gone up.
On the other hand, the transparent regime that we have established provides a level playing field among users and stake-holders.
This year, we will record the highest ever coal production.
Also, 2015 was the year when India’s highest ever generation of electricity was recorded.
On the issue of safety of properties and rights, we have already enacted a law for fast tracking of arbitration proceedings.
We are establishing dedicated Commercial Courts and Commercial Divisions in High Courts.
The formation of the Company Law Tribunal is at the final stage.
Soon we shall be putting in place an effective IPR Policy and patent regime.
We hope to pass the bankruptcy law which has been tabled in Parliament.
Hence, on the front of policy and procedure, we have made our systems cleaner, simpler, pro-active and business friendly.
I believe in Minimum Government and Maximum Governance.
Therefore, almost on a daily basis, we are trying to remove the bottlenecks that were affecting investments and growth.
It is good to see that changes and corrections are taking place not just at the level of the Federal Government but also at the state level.
States are now in healthy competition to provide ease of business and infrastructure linkages.
The results have been encouraging.
India has become the fastest growing large economy in the world.
We will end this fiscal year with well over seven per cent growth in GDP.
IMF, World Bank, OECD, ADB and other institutions have projected even better growth in the coming days.
In 2014-15, India contributed 12.5 per cent of global growth.
Its contribution to global growth is 68 per cent higher than its share of the world economy.
Let me also mention some other indicators:
· India has consistently been ranked as the most attractive investment destination by several global agencies and institutions.
· We have jumped twelve ranks in the latest global ranking by the World Bank on ease of doing business.
· India has jumped sixteen places on the World Economic Forum’s global competitive index.
· Moody’s has upgraded the rating of India as positive.
The momentum of the Make in India campaign has given us confidence.
It motivates us to make our policies and processes easier and friendlier.
With this background, I invite and encourage you to make India your work place; and also your home.
We are particularly keen to scale up investments in next generation infrastructure.
This includes roads, ports, railways, airports, telecom, digital networks and clean energy.
We are also investing in our social, industrial and agricultural infrastructure to give better income and quality of life to our people.
So far, it was our implementation capacity that was the biggest bottleneck.
We have speeded up processes.
The result is faster turn-around of projects.
India’s highest ever kilometers of new highway contracts awarded was in 2015.
Similarly, the increase in railway capital expenditure was the highest this year.
Thus, whether it is physical or social infrastructure; we are executing it much more efficiently than ever before.
Another bottleneck was financing.
To enhance financing, we are trying innovative ways.
We are opening up our Greenfield and Brownfield projects for Public Private Partnership.
With strong fiscal discipline, and by plugging leakages, we are trying to provide more resources for infrastructure.
We have also set up the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
We have come up with the mechanism of Tax Free Infrastructure Bonds for projects in rail, road and irrigation sectors.
We are working with a number of countries, financial markets and funds on these financial instruments.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
India is a land of immense opportunities.
Fifty of our cities are ready for setting up Metro Rail Systems.
We have to build fifty million houses.
There is no time for incremental changes.
We want a quantum jump.
We have also decided to do this in a cleaner and greener way.
That is why, we have made a commitment to the world community at the recent COP-21 meeting in Paris.
Hence, we are going for renewable energy in a big way – 175 Gigawatts.
I lay great stress on zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
We place high emphasis on energy efficiency, water re-cycling, waste to energy, clean India and river cleaning.
These initiatives are directed at improving quality of life in cities and villages.
These initiatives provide you additional avenues for investment in technologies, services and human resources.
India is blessed with three Ds.
These are: Democracy, Demography and Demand.
To this, we have added the fourth D that is Deregulation.
Today’s India is this four dimensional India.
Our judicial systems are independent and time tested.
You will not find all these elements in any other country.
With these strengths, India offers you a solid platform to test and launch your making and designing capabilities.
In addition, our maritime location makes it easy to market products in several other continents.
We are trying to further enable and harness this vast potential with path-breaking initiatives.
Campaigns like Digital India and Skill India have been designed to prepare people to take part in this process.
We have launched financing schemes which are dedicated to promote entrepreneurship.
We are giving loans through MUDRA Bank without any collateral.
I have also impressed upon the Banks to particularly finance young entrepreneurs belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes as well as women entrepreneurs.
· Only this will realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi who wanted industries to be run in Villages and Cottages.
· Only this will realize the dreams of Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar who advocated the need to move surplus labour from agriculture to other occupations.
We are soon going to strengthen this process further under the banner of Stand-up India.
I feel that today, our domestic industry and investors are feeling much more confident and optimistic in spite of an uncertain global situation.
When we started the Make in India campaign, manufacturing growth in the country was 1.7 per cent.
This year it has improved substantially.
In the current quarter, manufacturing growth is expected be around 12.6 per cent.
· The total number of investment proposals during the last eight months is higher by 27 per cent.
· We have recorded the highest ever production of motor vehicles in 2015.
· As many as fifty new mobile phone factories were set up in the country during past ten months.
· As per estimates of certain agencies, the Indian job market is now on a strong footing.
Similarly, on the trade front:
· India’s highest ever software exports were recorded in 2015.
· Also in 2015, our major ports handled the highest ever quantity of cargo.
These are very good signs.
I would like to give our industry some friendly advice.
There are immense opportunities in India.
You should take advantage of the renewed interest of Global Players to work in India.
Many of them are looking for technological and financial collaborations with Indian partners.
This includes high-tech sectors and high-value areas like defence production.
I assure you that if you take one step; we will walk two steps for you.
In a competitive world improving managerial and technological capacity is essential for survival and growth.
From space shuttles to pollution control; from health to education; from agriculture to services; our young entrepreneurs and start-ups are showing us newer and faster ways for enterprise and delivery.
My Government is committed to support them and tap their energy fully.
We want our youth to become job creators rather than job seekers.
That is why, we have launched the Start up India Campaign.
· Our machines are able to make the best;
· Our products are able to beat the rest.
Make in India is a drive to fulfill unmet demands of the common man.
It is also an effort to engage and empower the unemployed.
I also emphasize on Make for India; so that human and sectoral needs can be fulfilled.
I have heard several global companies talk about their localization plans.
Thus, this campaign has the capacity to boost the Indian economy and also brighten the global scenario.
I have been saying that this century is Asia’s century.
My advice to you is to Make India your center; if you want this century to be your century.

My friend President Macri and all the distinguished guests from Argentina,
Greetings, (Namaskar)
I warmly welcome Mr. President, his family and the delegation.
It is a matter of great pleasure that two months after our meeting in Buenos Aires, I have this opportunity to welcome you today in India.
On this occasion, I once again congratulate President Macri and his team for the efficient and successful hosting of the G-20 Summit in 2018.
The leadership of President Macri was important for the successful hosting of the Summit.
For this I am thankful to him.
My fifth meeting with President Macri today reflects the fast and growing importance of bilateral engagement between the two countries.
We have proved that the distance of 15,000 kilometers between the two countries is just a number.
This visit of President Macri is taking place in a special year; This is the 70th year of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
But the mutual relations of our people is older than this.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore had traveled to Argentina in 1924.
The immense effect of that journey has become immortal through his creations.
Considering our shared values and our interests to promote peace, stability, economic progress and prosperity both the countries have given their relations the status of a strategic partnership.
I and President Macri agree that terrorism is a very serious threat to global peace and stability.
The brutal terrorist attack in Pulwama shows that the time for discussions is over now.
Now the whole world unitedly needs to take concrete steps against terrorism and its supporters.
Hesitating to act against terrorists and their anti-humanitarian supporters is also equivalent to promoting terrorism.
As the G-20 countries, it is also important that we implement the 11-point agenda of ‘Hamburg Leaders’ Statement’ on countering terrorism.
In this regard it is important that, we, both the countries are issuing a special declaration against terrorism after our discussions today.
Our cooperation in the field of space and peaceful use of nuclear energy is continuously increasing.
The Memorandum of Understanding signed today in respect of Defense Cooperation will give a new dimension to our cooperation in the defense sector.
India and Argentina are complementary to each other in many ways.
It is our endeavor to take full advantage of this for our mutual benefit.
Argentina is the powerhouse of agriculture.
India sees it as an important partner for its food security.
The work-plan of Agro-Industrial Cooperation between us today is an important step in this direction.
India’s success in the ICT field, especially JAM i.e. Jandhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity and digital payment infrastructure, we are ready to share with Argentina.
Our joint venture ‘KABIL’ has started discussions with Argentina for cooperation in the mining sector.
There are possibilities for significant increase in many sectors such as agriculture, metals and minerals, oils and gas, pharmaceutical, chemicals, motor vehicles and services.
Today we have identified specific methods to enhance our commercial engagement.
I am glad that representatives from many important Argentine companies have come with President Macri.
I am confident that his talks with business leaders in Delhi and Mumbai will be useful.
India was the first country to sign a Preferential Trade Agreement with MERCOSUR in 2004.
During the present Presidency of Argentina, today we discussed several measures for the expansion of the India-MERCOSUR trade.
There are millions of fans of Indian art, culture and spirituality in Argentina.
Argentina’s Tango dance and football is very popular in India.

Since then, with the approval of the Cabinet, the MoU with the Institute has been renewed from time to time by signing Supplementary Addenda.
The last of such Supplementary Addendum called Supplementary Addendum IX signed for a five year period, expired on 31st March 2011.
Named after Late Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, former Prime Minister of India, the Shastri Indo-Canadian institute (SlCI) was established with an aim to promote understanding between India and Canada through facilitation of academic activities between the two countries.
The Institute maintains offices in both India and Canada.
The role of SlCI is of facilitating fellowships and collaborative research initiatives that focus principally on the aspects that bring advantage to Indian-Canadian institutions and academics.
SlCI, in the past, had focused in the fields of Humanities and Social Sciences but expanded its area of interest from 2001 onwards into the fields of Law, Management, Information Science, Science and Technology and Human Interface of Science.
My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.”
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has approved the Mumbai Urban Transport Project Phase-III.
The estimated cost of project is Rs.8,679 crore with completion cost of Rs.10,947 crore.
The project is expected to be completed in the next 5 years during 13th Plan period.
Western Railway is running suburban services on the existing busy double line between Virar-Dahanu Road which is a part of main line Mumbai –Ahmedabad / Delhi route.
Main line is already over saturated and there is no scope for supplementing suburban services on this line.
Construction of additional double line between Virar-Dahanu Road will address the demand of commuters in this region.
This will provide extension of suburban services from Churchgate to Dahanu Road.
Panvel-Karjat double line suburban corridor will cater to the significant urbanization and population growth in recent years in this area.
Presently, passengers commuting from Kalyan to Vashi/ Panvel or in reverse direction, have to get down at Thane and take Trans Harbour link.
This results in congestion at Thane which is already a busy station on Central Railway.
Airoli-Kalwa corridor will reduce congestion at Thane station and will also save time as these passengers can travel bypassing Thane.
Procurement of new coaches will enhance the quality of service and reduce congestion.
The works proposed under trespass control at 22 locations shall significantly reduce trespass and will provide safer environment for the public.
The areas covered by this project are Thane, Palghar, Raigad and Mumbai districts of Maharashtra.
The Mumbai suburban railway network on Central and Western Railways has 376 route Kms.
Everyday approximately 8 million people travel in suburban section in more than 2900 train services.
There is severe overcrowding in the suburban trains specially during peak hours.
Due to geographical constraints, spread of the population and location of business areas, the rail network will continue to be the principal mode of mass transport in Mumbai.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following proposals with regard to the Fund of Funds of Start-ups (FFS) which was established in June, last year with a corpus of Rs. 1,000 crores.
Further, if the amount committed for a Start-up in whole has not been released before a Start-up ceases to be so, the balance funding can continue thereafter.
It was decided that the FFS shall contribute to the corpus of Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) for investing in equity and equity linked instruments of various start-ups at early stage, seed stage and growth stages.
The FFS is being managed and operated by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).
It was also pointed out to the Department by SIDBI that the present provisions don’t provide for SIDBI to get compensated for activities done post sanction to AIFs.

Jurisdiction:
The jurisdiction of NFRA for investigation of Chartered Accountants and their firms under section 132 of the Act would extend to listed companies and large unlisted public companies, the thresholds for which shall be prescribed in the Rules.
The Central Government can also refer such other entities for investigation where public interest would be involved.
The inherent regulatory role of ICAI as provided for in the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 shall continue in respect of its members in general and specifically with respect to audits pertaining to private limited companies, and public unlisted companies below the threshold limit to be notified in the rules.
Further, ICAI shall continue to play its advisory role with respect to accounting and auditing standards and policies by making its recommendations to NFRA.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved ‘Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan’ (PMGDISHA) to make 6 crore rural households digitally literate.
This is in line with the announcement made by Finance Minister in the Union Budget 2016-17.
PMGDISHA is expected to be one of the largest digital literacy programmes in the world.
Under the scheme, 25 lakh candidates will be trained in the FY 2016-17; 275 lakh in the FY 2017-18; and 300 lakh in the FY 2018-19.
To ensure equitable geographical reach, each of the 250,000 Gram Panchayats would be expected to register an average of 200-300 candidates.
Digitally literate persons would be able to operate computers/digital access devices (like tablets, smart phones, etc.), send and receive emails, browse internet, access Government Services, search for information, undertaking cashless transactions, etc. and hence use IT to actively participate in the process of nation building.
The implementation of the Scheme would be carried out under the overall supervision of Ministry of Electronics and IT in active collaboration with States/UTs through their designated State Implementing Agencies, District e-Governance Society (DeGS), etc.
This highlights that more than 15 crore rural households (@ 94% of 16.85 crore households) do not have computers and a significant number of these households are likely to be digitally illiterate.
The PMGDISHA being initiated under Digital India Programme would cover 6 crore households in rural areas to make them digitally literate.
This would empower the citizens by providing them access to information, knowledge and skills for operating computers / digital access devices.
It is a great pleasure to meet President Obama in New York.
Thank you for hosting this meeting.
I deeply value your friendship and your vision and commitment for the relationship between our two countries.
We have achieved significant progress in our bilateral cooperation and international partnership.
I was in Silicon Valley over the weekend.
I experienced the strength of American innovation and enterprise that provide the foundation of American success.
I also saw the driving force of our relationship – youth, technology and innovation; and, the natural partnerships of Indian and Americans in advancing human progress.
California also reminds us that India and the United States are part of the dynamic Asia Pacific Region.
Amid the problems that the world faces today and the global challenges that we see ahead, our partnership is of great significance for us and our world.
We can apply innovation and technology for achieving Sustainable Development Goals, including combating climate change and conserving Nature.
We have both set ambitious national agendas.
This is an exercise we are undertaking in the spirit of our culture and tradition, but also because of our commitment to the future of this planet.
Our extraordinary bilateral partnership in the energy sector focuses on clean and renewable energy and energy efficiency.
I also thank President Obama for his positive response to my call for a global public partnership for developing affordable clean energy sources that will enable faster adoption of clean energy across the world.
We should work together to advance that goal.
And, it is equally important to develop mechanisms to ensure that the affordable also become accessible to those who need it the most.
We look forward to comprehensive and concrete outcome in Paris with a positive agenda on combating climate change, which also focuses on access to finance and technology for the developing world, especially the poor countries and small island states.
I thanked President Obama for U.S. support for India’s permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council.
I also sought U.S. support to complete the reform process within a fixed time frame.
I expressed our appreciation for continued U.S. support for India’s membership of the international export control regimes within our targeted time frame.
Our partnership addresses a broad range of strategic and security concerns.
Our defence cooperation, including defence trade and training, is expanding.
As existing terrorism threats grow and new ones emerge, we have resolved to further deepen cooperation on counter terrorism and radicalism.
We have just had a successful cyber security dialogue.
We have agreed to further strengthen our consultation and cooperation on helping the Afghan people combat terrorism and build a peaceful, stable and prosperous future of their nation.
I welcomed the progress in giving shape to our Joint Strategic Vision on Asia, Pacific and Indian Ocean Regions as also our joint engagement with regional partners like Japan.
This will also strengthen our maritime security cooperation.
To further increase our strategic engagement in the region, I look forward to working with the U.S. for India’s early membership of Asian Pacific Economic Community.
Our economic partnership is a key driver of our relationship.
I have had excellent meetings with business leaders in New York and San Jose.
I am very pleased with their confidence in India and value their constructive feedback and suggestions.
We will also continue to work towards a stronger bilateral framework of economic cooperation, including the Bilateral Investment Treaty and Totalisation Agreement.
This meeting and my engagements in the U.S. demonstrate the extraordinary depth and diversity of our relationship.
Our meeting today was very productive in advancing some of our immediate priorities as also our broader strategic partnership.
We, the leaders of India and Russia, in the year that marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries, note that the Indian-Russian special and privileged strategic partnership is a unique relationship of mutual trust between two great powers.
Our relationship covers all areas of cooperation, including in the spheres of political relations, security, trade and economy, military and technical field, energy, scientific, cultural and humanitarian exchanges, and foreign policy, and helps promote national interests of both countries, and contributes to the establishment of a more peaceful and just world order.
Our bilateral relations are based on deep mutual understanding and respect, similar priorities in economic and social development, as well as in foreign policy.
This partnership was further elevated to the level of a Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership on 21 December 2010.

We will jointly encourage our business communities to use the existing workable schemes and mechanisms for settlements in national currencies elaborated by the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of Russia.
We will coordinate our positions in order to develop a credit rating industry that is transparent for the market participants and independent from political conjuncture.

We acknowledge the importance of developing economic cooperation at the regional level.
We take note of the fact that both States are committed to building knowledge based economies, on the basis of latest scientific advances and innovation.

We will work together to further develop the potential for cooperation in the diamond industry with an objective to take full advantage of existing strengths and resources of both our countries in this area.

We will work to foster the democratization and reform of global political, economic, financial and social institutions, for them to better accommodate the interests of all members of the international community.
We are convinced that the unprecedented spread of this threat requires decisive collective response on part of the entire global community, without double standards and selectivity, in accordance with international law and the UN Charter.
Our Bilateral cooperation in the sphere of Science & Technology offers great opportunities.
We are working together to create networks of knowledge centers, connectivity of minds and scientific corridors to augment innovation led technology development for societal development.
We intend to further foster development of tourism and people-to-people contacts, including by easing the visa regime.

I look forward to the Townhall Q&A on Sunday 27th September at 10 PM IST (9:30 AM Pacific time).
The interaction will cover a wide range of issues and will surely be a memorable one.
This programme will be incomplete without your participation!
Share your questions on Facebook.
I urge you all to share your questions on the ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App.’

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of former Chief Minister of Manipur and senior politician Mr. Rishang Keishing.

Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Major Dhyan Chand on National Sports Day.
The Prime Minister has also congratulated the sportspersons and coaches to be honoured with various sports awards.
Remember the situation one year ago.
Large-scale corruption at various levels of Government gave rise to scams on a regular basis.
We have given a clean, transparent and efficient Government.
This gives us the confidence to move ahead with even greater dynamism.
(2) Your detractors allege that yours is a pro-corporate, anti-farmer and anti-poor government.
What is your comment?
Those who gave away precious natural resources like coal and spectrum to their favourite industrialists have no right to say this.
Everyone knows where the country stands after sixty years of Congress rule.
They have been sustaining their politics only in the name of the poor.
But what have they actually done.
Poverty is still widespread in the country.
You should ask them- If you were pro-poor, why does poverty still exist in India?”
In just one year, we have taken steps on every possible front to help bring people out of the vicious cycle of poverty. — For financial inclusion, we implemented the Jan Dhan scheme and opened more than 14 crore bank accounts.
People get insurance cover as well as overdraft facility through these accounts. — For workers, we introduced a number of schemes including the Universal Account Number so that they can avail their EPF benefits.
In addition, we have introduced the pension scheme of Rs. 1000 for them. — We have launched MUDRA Bank for financing 6 crore small vendors and businesses 61% of whom are SCs, STs, OBCs and Minorities. — We took up the task of providing toilets in all schools.
It is going to be completed in next few months.
(7) There are issues with regard to agricultural economy.
We need to recognize that the problem in agriculture is endemic, and decades of mismanagement have led to the present situation.
Both India and China have potential for growth, and we can together tackle the problem of poverty.
I and President Xi are committed at personal level to take the cooperative and peaceful process forward.
(9) Curbing price rise and inflation were your main promises during elections.
If you can recall that bad phase, misdeeds and wrong doings, you will feel that the country got rid of ‘bure-din’ (bad phase).
Now, I, leave it for you to decide how you view our success in bringing the country out of that bad phase.
So far as the price rise is concerned, only one data on inflation is enough to explain the situation.
The inflation that was at high mark of 8.2 per cent in May 2014 was brought down to 4.9 per cent in April 2015.
The results of independent public surveys conducted recently are also before you.
While assessing the government on strict parameters, people have given us very high marks.
You cannot imagine, what would have been the level of price rise and corruption, had this government not assumed the power.
Our strategy is to wage a war against poverty, we have to wage this war making poor our trusted friends and partners and to win this war.
We believe that in this war poor themselves will be the most powerful medium and we are heading for a sure win.
Then there is no issue.
Violence is beneficial neither to that nation nor to us.
The deadlock should end.
At the onset of the 21st century, the concept of BRICS emerged and it was believed that the present Century would be driven by these nations.
Soon this impression started emerging that India is weak in BRICS and entire hypothesis of BRICS got upset.
This situation put responsibility on my government.
I was aware of the significance and impact of the challenges.
The world was new for me and I was new for the world.

Sisters and brothers of Kerala,
I feel blessed to be visiting God’s own country.
In Kollam, on the banks of the Ashtamudilake, I sense recovery from the floods of last year.
But we have to work harder to rebuild Kerala.
Ease of living for the people is the commitment of my government.
We believe in sabkasaath, sabkavikas.
With this commitment, my government gave the final sanction to this project in January 2015.
I am happy that with contribution and co-operation of state government, we have completed the project in an effective manner.
Since May 2014, when my Government took over, we have given top priority to develop infrastructure in Kerala.
Under Bharatmala a detailed project report for Mumbai Kanyakumari Corridor is under preparation.
Many such projects are in various such stages of development.
In our country, we have often seen that infrastructure projects get stalled after announcement for various reasons.
A lot of public money is wasted due to cost and time over-runs.
We decided that this culture of wastage of public money cannot continue.
Through PRAGATI, we are accelerating projects and overcoming this problem.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I sit with all secretaries of government of India and chief secretaries of state governments and review such delayed projects.
I was surprised to see that some projects are 20 to 30 years old and are hugely delayed.
It is a crime to deprive the common man of the benefits of a project or a scheme for such a long time.
Till now, I have reviewed more than 250 projects worth about 12 lakh crore rupees under PRAGATI.
Friends, Atal ji believed in the power of connectivity and we are taking his vision forward.
From national highways to rural roads, pace of construction has almost doubled as compared to the previous government.
I am sure that we will definitely achieve the target of 100% soon.
As in road sector my government has given priority to railways, waterways and airways.
National waterway from Varanasi to Haldia has already started.
It will ensure a clean mode of transportation and will preserve the environment for future generations.
Regional air connectivity has also improved immensely in last four years.
The rate of doubling electrification and laying of new tracks has shown big improvement.
All this is also leading to increase in job creation.
We also connect aspirations with achievements, optimism with opportunities and hope with happiness.
My commitment is for the development of each of my countrymen.
The last man in the queue is my priority.
My government has sanctioned a new fund of 7,5 00 crore rupees for the fisheries sector.
The government has sanctioned more than 1,100 crores rupees till now.
India’s ranking in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index of the World Economic Forum moved from 65th position to 40th position.
Introduction of the e-Visa has been a game changer for Indian Tourism.
This facility is now available to nationals of 166 countries worldwide.
Recognizing the tourism potential of Kerala we have sanctioned 7 projects in the State under the Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD schemes for an approximate amount of Rs. 550 crore.
Later today, I will inaugurate one such project at Sree Padmanabhaswamy
Temple in Thiruvananthapuram.I will also seek blessings from Lord Padmanabhaswamy for the welfare of people of Kerala and other parts of the country.
I have heard of the phrase “Kollam kandalillamvenda” which means once in Kollam, one never misses home.
I also share the same feeling.
I thank people of Kollam and Kerala for their love and affection.
I pray for a developed and strong Kerala.
Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the passing away of Shri Balram Jakhar.
“Balram Jakhar ji was a popular leader who enriched our Parliamentary democracy in his long political journey.
I congratulate Rail Minister Suresh Prabhu, on presenting a thoughtful budget for the dynamic Railways of a progressive nation.
Cleanliness and upgradation of passenger facilities and technology remains the basic Mantra of last two budgets.
Beside this, Railway projects have been defined on the basis of ‘Commissioning’, in place of ‘Completion’.
I believe this policy-transformation is a Paradigm-shift in nation’s economy.
The special arrangement of the ‘Super-fast trains’ for the poor through launch of Antodaya Express and Deen-Dyalu rail coaches , reiterate the commitment of our government to the poor.
Appropriate steps has been taken towards fulfilling the Government’s promise to enhance connectivity in the backward areas of the country, especially the North-East.
Beside, the chronic problem of our rail routes due to the lack of capacity, has been done away with to a large extent over the past one year.
This Rail Budget has further strengthened the measures..
This budget will be an important tool towards the renovation of the nation.
My congratulations once to the Railways Minister Mr. Suresh Prabhu, Rail Family and the Team Railway.
M. Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Smt.
Sumitra Mahajan were also present on the occasion.
Congratulating the award winners, Prime Minister said that their contributions to Parliament and the country would always be remembered.
He added that it is an honour to work with and learn from these outstanding parliamentarians.
Prime Minister said that Parliament represents the dreams and voice of 125 crore Indians.

He said the new airport terminal had been completed in a record time of one year.
The Prime Minister said that the Government is also working to ensure a clean Ganga.
He said the sewage treatment plants and beautification of Ghats would go a long way in this regard.

He said it unites us, and gives a glimpse of Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat.
He said that the organisation of the Kumbh is not just a matter of faith, but also a matter of prestige, and every visitor to the Kumbh should be well taken care of.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has remembered former Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi, on his birth anniversary.
Whether it was Mangal Pandey Ji or Chittu Pandey Ji or be it the tradition of Chandra ShekharJi, and HarivanshJi is also in that series.
And it is a matter of happiness for me that he had been a student in Banaras.
He obtained education in Banaras.
You would be pleased to know that he worked in Hyderabad for two important years of his life.
At times he had been to several places like Mumbai, Hyderabad and Delhi.
However, he was never influenced by those glittering mega cities.
He went to Calcutta to work in Ravivar newspaper.
And all of us are aware that SP Singh was a stalwart, he was well known in the world of television.
He worked with SP Singh.
And as a trainee journalist he had worked with DharamvirBharati.
He had started his life from there.
He worked with DharmYug with a sense of attachment.
He was a confidant of Chandra ShekharJi and every person has unique traits about the dignity and values of the office he holds.
He had all the information because of the kind of office he was holding in Chandra ShekharJi’steam.
He had advance information that Chandra ShekharJi was about to tender his resignation.
He himself was associated with a newspaper.
He was attached to the world of journalism.
However, he never let his own newspaper get an idea of it that Chandra ShekharJi was about to resign.
While maintaining the dignity of his office he kept that secret to himself.
He did not allow the news to be published in his own newspaper so that the newspaper can win praise.
HarivanshJi joined Ravivar newspaper in Bihar.
And the circulation of news paper of just 400 copies when he had joined it.
The person who had several opportunities in life, there were avenues if he had gone to the banking sector.
However, he was a talented person and he dedicated himself to a newspaper with a circulation of just 400 copies.
His four decade long journalistic career reflects powerful journalism and that journalism was attached to the society’s cause.
It was not for those in power.
And I believe that it would have been easier to run a newspaper and supervise journalists.
It’s a different experience when one is oriented toward the cause of the society and social work.
And the experience with the ruling class is different.
You have shown the example of a successful tenure as a member of parliament to everyone.
Therefore, it is a huge task, it is a challenging task to compel everyone to play by the rules.
However, HarivanshJi will certainly be able to do this thing.
HarivanshJi’s wife Shrimati Asha Ji, she is from Champaran.
I am confident that now this thing will become a mantra in the house that all of us members of the parliament will have the grace of God (Hari).
Now everyone will be banking on Hari (HarivanshJi).
And everyone was saying this thing that they knew the result but decided to participate in the process.
And I would like to thank all the dignitaries, all the honorable members for taking forward this entire process in a very good manner and also to the deputy chairman.
So today we are going to be guided by the gentleman manwho has always been attached to the people at the bottom of the society.

Thank you, Mr. President, for your invitation and for naming this dam as Afghanistan-India Friendship Dam.
We are truly humbled by the generosity of the Afghan spirit.
Rivers have been bearers of great civilisations of the world.
In the flow of rivers runs the course of human progress.
In the Holy Quran, river is central to the image of Paradise.
In the ancient scriptures of India, rivers defined our nation and were celebrated as the giver of life.
For the snow feeds the rivers that sustain life and agriculture.
So, today, we are not just launching a project that will irrigate land and light up homes.
We are reviving a region, restoring hope, renewing life and redefining Afghanistan’s future.
The project would not just irrigate the fields of six hundred and forty villages in Chiste, Obe, Pashtun Zarghun, Karokh, Gozara, Injil, Zindjan, Kohsan and Ghoryan .
It would also bring light to over two hundred and fifty thousand homes in this area.
Last December, in Kabul, I was moved by the honour of inaugurating the Afghan Parliament Building.
The lost decades speak to us about the ravages of a long drawn war.
And, when a new dawn broke over Afghanistan in 2001, we resumed the project.
They will not come in the way of the dreams and aspirations of the Afghan people.
The fields that produce the finest fruits and saffron shall once again come alive with the clear waters of the river.
The homes that lived through dark nights of dread will now be lit by the power of hope.
Children shall again believe in the possibility of a future of education and opportunity.
And, another young girl poet will not have to live a life of pain, denial and longing, or see a life of promise cut short.
Herat has time and again seen sublime glory and tragic ruin.
And, the city that once Jalaluddin Rumi held as the finest, will rise again.
The city that was the gateway to the West, South and Central Asia,will once again be the hub that will unite the regions in a peaceful pursuit of prosperity.
So, to the people and Government of Herat and the Government of Afghanistan, I express our deepest appreciation for your support, patience and understanding – and, above all, your belief in us.
This dam has not been built by bricks and mortar, but by the faith of our friendship and the valour of Afghans and Indians.
Bonds that remind us of ancient links between this region and India.
For many, the Harirud River is one strand of our connected histories since the ancient Vedic times.
Today, the world will see the Harirud River as an abiding emblem of our commitment to a shared future of progress.
And, the Friendship Dam unites us in solidarity as Chishti Sharif joined us in spirit centuries ago.
For, it is from here that the Chishti Silsila or Chishti tradition of Sufism came to India.
Its glorious tradition and teachings resonate through the dargahs of Ajmer, Delhi and Fatehpur Sikri.
In your clear eyes, I saw the deep well of affection for India.
In your smiles, I saw the joy of this relationship.
In the firmness of your embrace, I felt the trust in our friendship.
And, in those memorable hours, India witnessed once again the grace of your people, the beauty of this land and the friendship of a nation.
Today, I return with the gratitude and admiration of 1.25 billion people.
And, a renewed pledge for our partnership.
Together, our partnership has built schools, health centres and irrigation facilities for rural communities.
It has empowered women with skills and the youth with the education to shoulder the responsibility for Afghanistan’s future.
Now, India’s investment in the port at Chahbahar in Iran will give Afghanistan a new route to the world and a new path to prosperity.
And, to implement that vision,just last month, President Ghani joined President Rouhani of Iran and me in witnessing the signing of the Chahbahar Trade and Transit Agreement between Afghanistan, Iran and India.
The fruits of our friendship are not confined to Kabul, Kandahar , Mazar and Herat.
Our partnership will benefit every section of Afghan society.
Because across its difficult geography, and across its diversity, and beyond the identities as Pushtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras, Afghanistan must live and prosper as one.
For, divisions among Afghan people will only help those who seek to dominate the nation from outside.
As we work together, we draw strength and confidence from your deep commitment to protect our partnership from the designs of others.
When our people are under attack, the brave Afghans guard us as their own.
They put themselves in the line of fire so that their Indian friends are safe.
This is the nobility of your heart and the strength of your friendship.
I have seen this from the moment I assumed office as Prime Minister.
For on that day, when terrorists launched a massive attack on our Consulate in this city of Herat, the heroic efforts of Afghan soldiers, and of our personnel, saved many lives and prevented a big tragedy.
Mr. President, Friends,
Afghanistan’s success is a deeply held hope and desire of every Indian.
It comes from the love and admiration for Afghans in our hearts.
We want to see your democracy strike deep roots; your people unite; and, your economy prosper.
We want to see your art, culture and poetry thrive.
And, we want to see your cricketers join the ranks of test players and also seek glory in IPL.
But, it also comes from the recognition that when Afghanistan succeeds, the world will be safer and more beautiful.
When the values that define Afghans prevail, terrorism and extremism will be in retreat.
Because we know that extremism and terrorism cannot stop at your border or end at the boundaries of our region.
So, in the spreading unrest of our times, the world cannot forget the brave struggle that the Afghan people are waging – for themselves and our world.
India will not forget or turn away.
Where some doubt your future, we are certain that no force or power can deny the Afghan people the destiny they have chosen, however long and hard the journey may be.
And, in the fields, villages and cities of Afghanistan, we will work together for that future.
And, whatever happens, in a bright or a dark moment, we will always experience, as Herat’s great Sufi Poet, Hakim Jami, would say, the freshness and happiness of the gentle breeze of friendship.
Thank you for this honour, this affection and this friendship.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It gives me great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth and his delegation to India.
We are truly honoured, Excellency, that you have chosen India for your first overseas visit after taking on the new responsibility as Prime Minister of Mauritius earlier this year.
Your visit reflects the depth of our ties that have endured and enhanced over two centuries.
And, our bonds are not limited to Governments.
Our bonds have flourished despite time and distance.
Today, they weave a rich tapestry of friendship in diverse areas.
My discussions with Prime Minister Jugnauth have been warm and productive.
It also underscored the commonality of our values, interests and efforts.
Today, we have taken another leap in our bilateral agenda.
As frontline states of the Indian Ocean, Prime Minister Jugnauth and I agree that it is our responsibility to ensure collective maritime security around our coasts and in our EEZs.
We agree that effective management of conventional and non-conventional threats in the Indian Ocean is essential to pursue economic opportunities; protect the livelihood of our communities, and provide security to our people.
And, for this India-Mauritius cooperation is very very important.
We have to keep up our vigil against :
• Piracy that impacts trade and tourism;
• Trafficking of drugs and humans;
• Illegal fishing, and
• Other forms of illegal exploitation of marine resources
The conclusion of the bilateral Maritime Security Agreement today, will strengthen our mutual cooperation and capacities.
We have also agreed to further strengthen our wide-ranging cooperation in hydrography for a secure and peaceful maritime domain.
India is supporting the National Coast Guard of Mauritius in augmenting its capacity through Project Trident.
We have also taken a decision to renew the life of the Coast Guard Ship Guardian, that was provided to Mauritius, under a grant assistance programme.
A strong developmental partnership with Mauritius is a hallmark of our engagement.
India is proud to participate actively in the ongoing development activities in Mauritius.
The agreement today on a 500 million US dollars Line of Credit from India to Mauritius is a good example of our strong and continuing commitment towards the development of Mauritius.
It will also help in the implementation of priority projects.
Prime Minister Jugnauth and I welcome the progress in ongoing projects.
India will extend full support for the timely execution of projects identified between our countries.
Projects that will vitalize the economy of Mauritius and mark a qualitative transformation in our relations.
In our discussions, we also focused on increasing skill development cooperation with Mauritius.
It is an active part of our present interaction under India’s multiple capacity building programme with Mauritius.
We are happy to further deepen our exchanges in this domain.
We applaud the leadership shown by Prime Minister Jugnauth in drawing attention to the importance of renewable energy.
The signing and ratification of the framework agreement on International Solar Alliance by Mauritius has opened up new vistas of regional partnership for both countries in this field.
We take pride in this contribution of the Indian-origin community to the national life of Mauritius.
To promote our thriving links with the diaspora in Mauritius, India had, in January this year, declared a special carve-out on OCI cards only for Mauritius.
Our flag carrier airlines have agreed to enhance their code sharing arrangement to new destinations.
This too is expected to lead to greater tourism and people-to-people contacts between our countries.
Apart from bilateral issues, Prime Minister Jugnauth and I also exchanged views on a range of regional and global issues.
We agreed to continue supporting each other in multilateral fora and cooperate closely on our common challenges and interests.
Prime Minister Jugnauth’s visit will contribute to elevating our relationship to new heights on the bed-rock of our traditional links.
I thank Prime Minister Jugnauth for his vision and support to our relationship.
And I look forward to working closely with him in the coming months as we put into action the decisions we have taken today.
This is very, very special in itself.

If you return after a tiring day’s work, just open the windows and doors of the room and take a deep breath of fresh air – this will fill you with fresh energy.
The cleanliness drive that you had begun from the Ghats or Banks of the Ganges in Kashi has now taken the shape of a movement inspired by you.”

He appreciated all those involved with the compilation, and the effort behind it.
The Prime Minister asserted that a nation that does not honour and remember those who created, or are an important part, of its history, often does not have a secure future.
In that sense, he added that this effort, is not just a way to cherish the past, but is also a way to secure the future.
He said that youth should especially be made aware of this effort.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the exchange of tariff concessions, on Margin of Preference basis, under the Fourth Round of Negotiations under the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement and related amendments.
The current membership of APTA consists of six countries or Participating States (PSs), namely, Bangladesh, China, India, Lao PDR, Republic of Korea, and Sri Lanka.
Since this is a preferential trade agreement, the basket of items as well as extent of tariff concessions are enlarged during the trade negotiating rounds which are launched from time to time.
Till date, three rounds of trade negotiations have taken place.
Up to the Third Round, India has offered tariff preferences on 570 tariff lines at an average Margin of Preference (MoP) of 23.9% and an additional 48 tariff lines to LDC members at an average MoP of 39.7% at the 6-digit HS level.
The third round, with respect to all Participating States, cumulatively covered concessions on 4,270 products with MOP of 27.2%.
The Cabinet approved India’s offer 28.01% of dutiable national tariff lines (i.e. 3142 lines in HS2012 at 8-digit) with an average MoP of 33.45%.
This will deepen the concessions being offered under this Agreement.
Approval was also given to amend the preamble of APTA to effect accession of Mongolia as the 7th APTA Participating State.
Other amendments to incorporate the Sectoral Rule of Origin to the Agreement were also approved.
The Fourth Session of the Ministerial Council of APTA, which is scheduled to be held shortly, will formally implement all the above decisions.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for amendment in the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) to further incentivize investments in Electronic Sector and moving towards the goal of ‘ Net Zero imports’ in electronics by 2020.
Besides expediting investments into the Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector in India, the amendments in M-SIPS are expected to create employment opportunities and reduce dependence on imports.
The projects already received under the scheme have the potential to generate employment to the extent of upto one million persons (direct and indirect).
The salient features of the amendment are:
b) For new approvals, the incentive under the scheme will be available from the date of approval of a project and not from the date of receipt of application.
c) The incentives will be available for investments made within 5 years from the date of approval of the project.
d) Approvals will normally be accorded to eligible applications within 120 days of submission of the complete application.
e) A unit receiving incentives under the scheme, will provide an undertaking to remain in commercial production for a period of at least 3 years.
The Cabinet had, in July, 2012 approved the M-SIPS to provide a special incentive package to promote large scale manufacturing in the Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector.
The scheme provides subsidy for capital expenditure – 20% for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs.
The Scheme was amended in August, 2015 for scope enhancement and simplification of procedure.

It is particularly important in the arc from Eurasia to Asia Pacific, including in Central Asia and Afghanistan.
We are one in our belief that the world must unite and take concerted action on combating terrorism, without distinction and discrimination between terrorist groups and target countries.
We agree that an early political settlement through dialogue in West Asia is essential for restoring stability and containing extremism in the region.
Indeed, all nations must come together, with sensitivity to each other, to address the challenges of our times.
I am very pleased to have deepened my association with President Putin.
Together, we have also given new direction and added more momentum and content to our strategic partnership.

The warmth and affection that I received from the people of Jaffna is still fresh in my mind.
Today is another landmark day.
When, once again, we celebrate our partnership with the people of Sri Lanka and with residents of Jaffna.
Today, along with President Sirisena, we dedicate the renovated Durraiappah Stadium to the people of Sri Lanka.
And, we are not alone.
The modern tools of communication have enabled 1.25 billion people of India and the friendly people of Sri Lanka to join us in this celebration.
Even while we are sitting thousands of kilometres away in Delhi, we can feel the pulse of vibrancy and atmosphere of change in Jaffna.
The Durraiappah Stadium is not just brick and mortar.
It is a symbol of optimism and economic development.
An arena for a prosperous and healthy future for Jaffna’s youth.
It demonstrates your determination to shed the legacy of violence and pursue the path of economic progress.
Its foundations are supported by your courage and great sacrifices.
Its successful completion is a signal that you have left the past behind and are looking to the promise of a prosperous future.
Our relations are not limited to the confines of our two governments.
They reside in the rich contacts of our history, culture, language, art, and geography.
India strongly believes that its economic growth must drive and bring benefit to its neighbours.

Indeed, India’s support for Sri Lanka’s development is a promise of our friendship.
And, that it will be based on your priorities and your needs is an assurance that you can rely on.
This is what makes our enduring ties relevant to our present, as also to our future.
India’s desire is to see an economically prosperous Sri Lanka.
Excellency Sirisena and Friends,
In about seventy-two hours from now, the world would be celebrating the second anniversary of the International day of Yoga on 21 June.
And, today, we have celebrated the start of the International day of Yoga with a curtain raiser from Jaffna, from this Durraiappah Stadium.
The ‘Surya Namaskar’, performed just a short while ago, has sent the message of holistic healthcare, harmonious and sustainable living with nature to the world.
We could not have asked for a more fitting start and tribute to the International Day of Yoga.
Durraiappah Stadium will stand as yet another symbol of our lasting friendship.
India will walk side by side with Sri Lanka as it charts its own path to progress and prosperity for all of its citizens.
I once again convey greetings to the people of Sri Lanka from 1.25 billion people of India.
Bohoma Stuti, Mikka Nandri, Thank you very much
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Indian community in Jakarta.
He spoke of the special ties between India and Indonesia, and recalled the Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi earlier this year, where leaders from 10 ASEAN nations, including Indonesia, were present.
He noted that it is no coincidence that in 1950, the President of Indonesia had been the Chief Guest at the Republic Day Parade in New Delhi.
The Prime Minister said that in the last four years, India has witnessed unparalleled transformation.
He spoke of India’s vibrant start-up ecosystem, and the International Solar Alliance.
Both India and Indonesia have a sensitive outlook when it comes to helping those in need, the Prime Minister asserted.
He said that India does not see the colour of anyone’s passport, and helps all fellow humans who require any assistance.
He said India and Indonesia do not just rhyme in their names, but share a common rhythm in their culture, traditions, and democratic values.
My colleague Shri J. P. Nadda, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, Shri.
This is a landmark occasion, as for the first time, the Global Call to Action Summit is being held outside USA.
My Government is honoured to host this Summit.
All those delegates who have travelled a long distance to attend this Summit – I heartily welcome you to India and to New Delhi.
I am delighted to be with you this morning.
It will showcase the power of new partnerships, innovations and systems to bring about improvements in life-saving interventions.
I firmly believe that this Summit will provide a highly effective platform to address common challenges that will help us achieve the desired goals.
How we shape the world in the next 15 years will make the difference between prosperous, optimistic Nations, and insecurity and unrest.
I am glad to see 24 Nations present here to join together in their commitment to end preventable maternal and child death.
This is a “Call to Action” to all of us to seize this opportunity and think big.
The 24 priority countries participating in the Summit contribute nearly 70% of the preventable maternal and child deaths.
This forms the key peg for this Summit.
This also formed a crucial part of the joint statement issued subsequent to the visit of the US President in January this year, where we agreed to further accelerate the joint leadership to end all preventable maternal and child deaths.
What this translates into is this: India is likely to reach close to achieving the MDG target if the current trend of annual decline is sustained.
In addition to this remarkable achievement, another truly historic accomplishment has been the victory over Polio.
India was declared as “Polio-Free” on 27 March 2014.
I am also happy to share with you today another major milestone achieved by India.
India has eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus.
The validation for this has happened much before the global target date of December 2015.
This gives us the confidence to achieve other targets well before the target date.
It focusses on vaccinating the left-outs.
It also targets to accelerate the current increase in annual rate of immunization from existing 1% to more than 5% per year.
The first phase has been successfully implemented.
We want to ensure that no child in India dies of a vaccine-preventable disease.
India has always partnered with the global efforts on issues of child and maternal health.
Our focus has been to get pregnant women to have safe delivery in our institutions.
As a result, today, more than 75% of the deliveries take place in our institutions.
This has directly contributed to reduction in maternal mortality.
This has helped to further improve our institutional deliveries.
More than 92 million mothers and 78 million children have already been registered so far in the system.
One of our major concerns is equity.
To save and educate the girl child we have launched an ambitious program – Beti bachao Beti padhao.
We need to ensure that the girl child survives, thrives and plays a very crucial role in society.
I have witnessed people getting poorer because of unfortunate health episodes.
We need to institutionalise a system where marginalised communities receive universal health care and financial protection.
We must experiment and learn from each other.
India stands ready to boost its commitment and partner with other countries and move forward on our promise to end maternal and child deaths and provide a better life to the adolescent.
I invite you, to commit to bold measures and hold each other accountable to these promises.
As we assemble here, we need to send a very very strong message not only to ourselves, not only to the 24 countries present here, but to the entire world.
The message is of our commitment, that we will ensure that every woman, every child who can be saved will be saved.
We also need to make a clarion call to the world to join hands in taking such steps that would ensure this.
India stands committed to not only allocate resources towards this in our country, but also to help the world and all those countries which needed any support.
It is my personal vision and my Government’s firm commitment.
While every country present here has something to offer, India also has a wealth of experience.
We will offer whatever experience we have to the world community.
India would be happy to assist any country with technology, system strengthening and programme implementation capsules.
We could train personnel and skill them for better management of child sickness in our Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs) as well as share our experience at home based new born care.
This will be apart from our offer of support for Polio eradication.
I again warmly welcome you all to this important international Summit.
I hope the next two days would provide a new direction to the global community in its journey towards ending maternal and child deaths.
I wish you a pleasant stay in New Delhi.

In course of the presentation made by CEO NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant, it was noted that the pace of road construction has picked up significantly.
The Prime Minister was informed about progress made in digitisation of the transport sector.
The “MeriSadak” App has been launched in 10 regional languages, and has seen 9.76 lakh downloads so far.
Under the UDAN scheme, 27 airports are now operational in tier 2 and tier 3 cities.
In the ports sector, traffic volume in major ports increased by 17 percent in the period between 2014 and 2018.
This has boosted employment in the housing sector and related construction industries.
According to an independent study, the average construction completion time has dropped sharply, from 314 days in 2015-16, to 114 days in 2017-18.
Stress is also being given to disaster resilience, and low cost housing design typologies.
In urban housing, emphasis is being laid on new construction technologies.
54 lakh houses have been sanctioned under Pradhan MantriAwaas Yojana (Urban), since the inception of the scheme.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the PM has given it’s approval the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016.
The Order lays down a new institutional structure for policy and implementation in fast track manner and empowers National Mission for Clean Ganga to discharge its functions in an independent and accountable manner.
It has been decided to grant a Mission status to the Authority with corresponding powers under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to take cognizance of the provision of the said Act and follow up thereon.
Similarly, there is adequate delegation of financial and administrative powers which will distinctly establish NMCG as both responsibility and accountability centre and effectively accelerate the process of project implementation for Ganga Rejuvenation.
Briefly, the Order envisages:
1. Creation of the National Council for River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management), as an Authority under the Chairperson of Hon’ble Prime Minister, in place of the existing NGRBA for overall responsibility for superintendence of pollution prevention and rejuvenation of river Ganga Basin.
2. Setting up of an Empowered Task Force chaired by Hon’ble Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation to ensure that the Ministries, Departments and State Governments concerned have:
§ an action plan with specific activities, milestones, and timeliness for achievement of the objective of rejuvenation and protection of River Ganga,
§ a mechanism for monitoring implementation of its action plans.
It will also ensure co-ordination amongst the Ministries and Departments and State Governments concerned for implementation of its action plans in a time bound manner.
3. Declaration of National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) as an Authority with powers to issue directions and also to exercise the powers under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to enable it to carry out efficiently its mandate.
5. Similarly, the District Ganga Committees in each of the Ganga Bank Districts will carry out the assigned tasks as an Authority at the district level, to take cognizance of local threats and needs of river Ganga and conceptualise such measures as necessary to ensure overall quality of water in river Ganga and monitor various projects being implemented.
The proposed structure is to be implemented through the subordinate legislation route by issue of an Order invoking the provisions under Section 3 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (29 of 1986) relating to creation of authorities to achieve its objectives.
The other main features of the proposal are as follows:
It will also ensure proper co-ordination with the local bodies and compliance with the directions of NMCG for pollution abatement of the river Ganga.
§ NMCG will, however, take action only in the event when required action is not taken by CPCB.
CPCB shall also take action jointly with NMCG under the provisions of said Act.
§ A special focus of the revamped structure would be to maintain required ecological flows in the river Ganga with the aim of ensuring water quality and environmentally sustainable development.
For taking up fast track creation of sewerage treatment infrastructure in Ganga basin, an innovative model based on Hybrid Annuity has also been approved.
This will ensure that the infrastructure created under the project is operational on a sustainable basis.
In order to ensure transparency and cost effectiveness, a provision for concurrent audit, safety audits, research institutions and financial framework has been made.
Although, the NMCG has been functional as a registered Society since 2012 its role has been largely limited to fund the projects to implementing organisations.
It neither had the mandate to take cognizance of various threats to river Ganga nor the powers to issue directions to the concerned authorities/polluters.
While the organisation has been made responsible as custodian of river Ganga in both public eye as well as various courts, the mission is grossly ill-equipped to handle such expectations.
It is expected that the move will ensure effective abatement of pollution and rejuvenation of the River Ganga; maintain ecological flows in the River; impose restrictions on polluting industries; and carry out inspections to ensure compliance.
In addition, it is proposed to maintain and disseminate data and carry out research on the condition of the river.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will visit Katra, in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, tomorrow.

We gather as G20 to build a prosperous future for the world.
Today, we meeting the tragic shadow of dreadful acts of terrorism,united by a sense shock, pain and outrage.
We are united in condemning the barbaric attacks in Paris this week; and, the recent bombings in Ankara and Lebanon.
We share the sorrow of Russia for the lost lives in the fallen aircraft in Sinai.
These alone are a stark reminder of the dark force we face– larger than specific groups and particular targets and territories.
It is a major global challenge of our times.
It calls for a comprehensive global response.
Combating it must be major priority for G20.
I thank Turkey for scheduling a session on this challenge.
We are days away from charting a sustainable future for our planet.
The SDGs area comprehensive set of goals that places complete elimination of poverty in the world by 2030 as its top goal.

India’s development goals are aligned with the SDGs.
We are promoting growth and investing in skills to create employment for our youth;increasing the pace and quality of infrastructure expansion;and, investing in making far more productive and resilient.
We have the world’s largest financial inclusion programme.
And, we have definite target dates for meeting all the basic needs of our people.
Given our size and scale, India can become a pillar of global growth and stability.
This is centered on the belief in the unity of humanity and Nature.
We have ambitious plans for addressing the challenges of climate change.
This includes additional capacity of 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022;
cut in subsidies on fossil fuel and tax on coal; and, National Clean Energy Fund of US$3 billion to promote clean technologies.
With our highly ambitious/Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs),India would remain in step with the world.
We look forward to a concrete outcome in Paris within the framework of the UN Convention on Climate Change.
The framework has an appropriate balance of collective action: Equity and Common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities.
At G20,we can play an effective role in supporting the multilateral goals of increasing research and development to develop affordable renewable energy.
We should also ensure that finance and technology is available to meet the universal global aspiration for clean energy.
We must meet the target of US$100 billion goal per year by 2020.
G20 countries should increase the share of traffic on public transportation in cities by 30% by 2030.
We should shift from “carbon credit” towards “green credit”.
When we speak of targets, we must not only reduce the use of fossil fuel, but also moderate our life style.
Development in harmony with nature is the goal of my proposal to launch, along with the French President Hollande, an alliance of solar-rich countries at the time of COP-21 meeting.
Excellencies, let me conclude with a few points on development.
We are still short in our efforts to fulfill our last year’s commitment to raise our collective GDP by an additional 2% by 2018.
I propose that we consider how G20 can build support systems that focus on countries with maximum growth potential, help address specific bottlenecks there and facilitate implementation of country strategies.
G20 must continue to focus on infrastructure, as we did In Brisbane in 2014.
Clean energy and environment friendly infrastructure will address both development and climate change.
Bridging the current gap in infrastructure finance in the developing countries should remain our key priority.
I am happy with the focus on small holders and food losses in the G20 Action Plan on Agriculture.
Remittances are a key source of income for households and support for the economy in developing countries.
We should define a target date before 2030 to reduce the high costs of transferring remittances.
I look forward to fruitful discussions and substantive outcomes.

I urge all parties to reject the motion that has been moved in the House
Today the nation has seen the negativity expressed by some members.
India saw how some people are so deeply opposed to development:
If you were not prepared for the debate why did you bring the motion?
Why were you trying to delay the motion
The only thing they have to say- remove Modi
What we saw among members of the Opposition was sheer arrogance.
Let me tell this member it is the people who elected us.
That is how we have come here:
What is his hurry to come to power?
In the morning, the voting was not over, the debate was also not over one member comes running to me saying- Utho Utho Utho…
To remove one Modi, see who all they are trying to bring together:
We are not here for selfish interests:
We are here because we have the blessings of 125 crore Indians.
We have served the nation with the Mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’
Most of these villages were situated in Eastern India and the Northeast
Our government has the honour of working towards the electrification of 18,000 villages that were in the dark for 70 years.
Toilets have been constructed across India at a record pace:
Women are leading a smoke-free life due to Ujjwala Yojana.
Our Government has opened bank accounts for the poor.
Earlier, the doors of the banks never opened for the poor.
It is this Government that is bringing a programme like Ayushman Bharat that will give top quality healthcare to the poor: PM
The fight against Black Money is going to continue.
They have confidence in nothing
What have we come to?
Everything does not merit a childish conduct:
One of the leaders spoke about Doklam.
The same leader, who believed the Chinese Ambassador over our forces.
Due to one careless allegation in the House on Rafale, both nations had to release statements:
My appeal to the Congress is please do not bring politics in national security:
I will not tolerate this insult to our armed forces
You can abuse me as much as you want.
Stop insulting the Jawans of India.
You called the surgical strike a Jumla Strike.
I read a statement- “who says we do not have the numbers.”
The entire nation saw what the eyes did today.
It is clear in front of everyone
NDA Government is committed towards the development of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
I want to tell the people of Andhra Pradesh that we will keep working for them.
We will do everything possible for the development of AP:
I want to tell you about the NPA problem.
This Government stands with the Muslim women in their quest for justice
Any instance of violence brings shame to the nation.
I will once again urge the state governments to punish those who indulge in violence

Rameshwaram is the land which has shown the way to the spiritual life of the country as a light house for thousands of years.
And in this century Rameshwaram will also be known for one more reason – for providing this country a diligent scientist, a motivational teacher, an intelligent thinker and a great President in the form of Abdul Kalam ji.
It is a great honour for me to touch this sacred soil of Rameswaram.
A place that was also visited by Swami Vivekanand on his return from the United States in 1897.
It is a very emotional moment for me to have come to Rameshwaram on the death anniversary of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.
Last year, we had made a resolution and had promised you that in the memory of Dr. Kalam, a memorial will be built in Rameshwaram.
This memorial will inspire the present and the future generations of the country.
I congratulate Venkaiah ji and his entire team, the Tamil Nadu Government, all the Departments of the Government of India and DRDO for building such a monument.
You would be surprised if any work in our country is completed on time as per our imagination.
Then the citizens are surprised that can the government do such a thing?
I would like to share another secret behind the success of this monument which will make 125 Crore people of this country feel proud of.
And that secret ingredient, apart from the government, money, planning and focussed work is manifest in the form of those artisans, labourers, artists and architects who came from every corner of the country.
People from every corner of India were engaged in this work.
The labourers who were engaged in this work had been working as per the government norms from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Then they used to rest for one hour from 5 to 6 p.m., had their evening tea, and then used to do work for extra time from 6 pm. till 8 o’clock.
This memorial for Abdul Kalam ji in Rameshwaram is an example of the fact that whenever a labourer’s heart fills with the spirit of patriotism, great accomplishments are achieved.
I believe her soul will continue to shower blessings for Tamil Nadu’s bright future.
Today, I want to request the people of the country from this holy land of Rameshwaram.
People from every corner of India come to visit Rameshwaram.
I request the tour operators, the visitors of Rameshwaram, and the young generation of the country that whenever you visit Rameshwaram, please visit this memorial for Abdul Kalam ji and inspire the new generation.
You must definitely come for this inspirational pilgrimage.
They are often unaware of the fact that they are on the Indian side of the border or have crossed it and suffer a lot.
The Central Government under the Prime Minister’s Blue Revolution Scheme will help the fishermen.
And they have received big trawlers so that they can go for fishing in the deep sea.
Rameshwar’s land is also associated with Lord Ramchandra ji.
The famous Vivekananda memorial is nearby and I have learnt that the some NGOs in collaboration with the district collectorate have taken the lead in making Rameswaram green.
My congratulations to all the organizations working for Rameswaram’s future, especially the the Vivekananda Kendra.
The Indian Ocean and seven thousand five hundred kilometers long coastal line of India is full of investment potential.
The objective of this project is to transform India’s logistics sector by taking advantage of the country’s coastline.
We are trying to reduce the logistics cost of trade and imports and exports under the Sagarmala project.
We are trying to bring about a massive change in the lives of people living in the coastal areas through this program.
You would be happy to note that DRDO has constructed this monument as a tribute to Abdul Kalam Ji.
In the same manner DRDO is a very important for us working in the field of our military prowess.
The organization also undertakes welfare works for the people like this train which starts the journey from here today.
And, I’m happy that among the beneficiaries more than one crore people are from Tamil Nadu alone.
Chennai, Koimbatoor, Madurai, Tanjavur, all these big cities are among the ten cities in the state which have been selected for the Smart City Mission.
This scheme will immensely benefit Rameshwaram and as well as the 33 other cities including Madurai, Tutikorin, Tirunveli and Nagar Coil.
I’d like to make an appeal to the people and the Tamilnadu government.
I’d appeal to the state government to send the proposal, fast track the process of construction of the approved houses.
This inspiration is going to help us realize the dream of New India by 2022 when India will complete 75 years of its independence.
Our country will celebrate 75 years of its independence in 2022.
Every effort by us to fulfill the dreams of our freedom fighters, who sacrificed their lives for the country’s independence, will be a tribute to Dr. Kalam.
And today, when I’m in Rameshwaram, I am reminded of the efforts made by the people here.
Ramayana tells us a story of a little squirrel, a little squirrel of Rameshwaram that helped in building Ram-Setu.
From one end of the country to the other, Rameshwaram, the ocean begins here; and such a massive crowd reflects that how much respect you had for Dr. Abdul Kalam and how you want to dedicate yourself for the bright future of the country.
I can see this thing very clearly.
Once again I bow down to this massive crowd.

Governor of Tamil Nadu,
Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,
Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu,
My Ministerial colleagues,
Distinguished visitors,
Some of you may have attended this event several times.
A few may even have been attending it since inception.
I am both delighted and over-whelmed to see such a keen gathering here in this historic region of Kanchipuram in the great State of Tamil Nadu.
I am very happy to be here in the land of the great Cholas who established India’s historic civilization links through trade and education.
This is the land of our glorious maritime legacy.
This is the land from where India Looked East and Acted East thousands of years ago.
It is wonderful to see over five hundred Indian companies, along with over one hundred and fifty foreign companies present here.
It is an opportunity like none other, not only to discuss India’s defense requirements, but also to show-case, for the first time ever, in such a manner, India’s own defence manufacturing capabilities to the world.
Thousands of years of history of India shows that we have never desired any one’s territory.
Rather than winning countries through wars, India has believed in winning hearts.
This is the land from where the message of peace and universal brotherhood has gone out since Vedic times.
This is the land from where the light of Buddhism spread to the world.
In fact, from the time of Ashoka and even earlier, India has believed in using strength to protect the highest ideals of humanity.
India had no claim on territory.
He said that the King, or the ruler, must protect his people.
And, he also said that peace is preferable to war.
Our commitment to peace is just as strong as our commitment to protect our people and our territory.
And for this, we are ready to take all steps required to equip our Armed Forces, including through the establishment of a strategically independent defence industrial complex.
We are conscious that creating a defence industrial complex is far from simple.
Since the government is almost the only buyer in India, you also need the government to grant an order.
And, you need the government even to grant permission to export.
Therefore, over the last few years, we have made a humble beginning.
On defence manufacturing licenses, on defence offsets, on defence exports clearances, on Foreign Direct Investment in defence manufacturing, and on reforming our defence procurement, we have taken many steps.
Offset guidelines have been made flexible by allowing changes of Indian Offset Partners and offset components, even in contracts already signed.
Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers are now not required to indicate the details of Indian Offset Partners and products at the time of signing of contracts.
We have also re-instated Services as an avenue of discharging offsets.
The Standard Operating Procedure for issue of export authorizations has been simplified and put in public domain.
The requirement of Government-signed End User Certificate for export of parts and components and other non-sensitive military stores, sub-assemblies, and sub-systems has been done away with.
We have taken a step forward and revised the Foreign Direct Investment cap of 26 percent to 49 percent through the automatic route, and even up to 100 percent on a case-to-case basis.
And we have seen some encouraging initial results.
In May 2014, the total number of defence licenses issued stood at 215.
In less than four years, we have issued 144 more licenses through a much more transparent and predictable process.
In May 2014, the total number of defence export permissions granted stood at 118, for a total value of 577 million dollars.
In less than four years, we have issued 794 more export permissions, for a total value of over 1.3 billion dollars.
From 2007 to 2013, the targeted offsets obligations were 1.24 billion dollars, of which only 0.79 billion dollars worth of offsets were actually discharged.
That is, an achievement rate of only about 63 percent.
From 2014 to 2017, the targeted offsets obligations were 1.79 billion dollars, of which 1.42 billion dollars’ worth of offsets were realized.
This is an achievement rate of close to 80 percent.
Procurement from Micro and Small Enterprises by the Defence Public Sector Undertakings and Ordnance Factories has gone up from about Rs. 3300 crores in 2014-15 to over Rs. 4250 crores in 2016-17.
This is an increase of close to 30 percent.
It is heartening to note that the contribution of small and medium scale sector to defence production has grown by 200 percent in the last 4 years.
And, they are increasingly also becoming part/ of the global supply chains.
I am also pleased that the share of Indian vendors in the procurement orders placed through defence capital expenditure has gone up from about 50 percent during 2011-14 to over 60 percent during the last three years.
I am sure that this will improve further in the years ahead.
We are committed to building a defence industrial complex that has room for everyone – public sector, private sector, as well as foreign firms.
These defence industrial corridors will utilize the existing defence manufacturing ecosystems in these regions, and further build upon it.
These corridors will become the engines of economic development and growth of defence industrial base in the country.
We have also established a Defence Investors Cell to assist and handhold the investors involved in Defence Production.
Government’s support for technology, innovation, research and development is essential for defence sector.
A Technology Perspective and Capability Road-map has been released to help the industry in planning and initiating technology development, partnerships and production arrangements.
In recent years, we have also taken various initiatives like Make In India, Startup India, and Atal Innovation Mission, to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in the Indian commercial eco-system.
Today, we have launched the ‘Innovation for Defence Excellence’ scheme.
It will set up Defence Innovation Hubs throughout the country to provide necessary incubation and infrastructure support to the start-ups in defence area.
Private venture capital into the defence sector, especially for start-ups will also be encouraged.
New and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Robotics are perhaps the most important determinants/ of defensive and offensive capabilities for any defence force in the future.
India, with its leadership in Information Technology domain, would strive to use this technology tilt to its advantage.
Dreams transform into thoughts, and thoughts result in action”.
Our dream is to Develop the Ecosystem to Foster an Environment of New and Creative Entrepreneurship in the defence manufacturing sector.
And for this, in the weeks ahead, we will undertake extensive consultations with all stakeholders, including both Indian and Foreign companies, about our Defence Production and Defence Procurement policy space.
I call upon all of you to actively participate in this exercise.
Our aim is not just to discuss, but to draw the right lessons.
Our intention is not to lecture, but to listen.
Our goal is not merely to tinker, but to transform.
There was a time when, like many other aspects of governance, the critical issue of defence preparedness was also hampered by policy paralysis.
We have seen the damage such laziness, incompetence or perhaps some hidden motives, can cause to the nation.
Issues that should have been long addressed by previous governments, are being resolved now.
You would have seen how the issue of providing bullet proof jackets to Indian Army soldiers was kept hanging for years.
We have not only taken bold action to meet our immediate critical requirements, but have also initiated a new process to procure 110 fighter aircraft.
And, in all our efforts to pursue efficiency and effectiveness in partnership with you, we will be guided by the highest ideals of integrity and probity.
This sacred land brings to mind the legend Thiruvalluvar, a celebrated Tamil poet and philosopher.

We will launch new initiatives in Goa even as we mark the successful operationalization of initiatives like the BRICS New Development Bank and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement.
I am optimistic that the BRICS Summit will strengthen intra-BRICS cooperation and advance our common agenda for development, peace, stability and reform.
In a first, I am happy that India is facilitating an outreach Summit with the BIMSTEC leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sir Lanka and Thailand.
Representing nearly two thirds of humanity together, we hope to tap the potential for cooperation and the dividends this will bring.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar to all of you!
Once, in Mann Ki Baat, I had mentioned about a retired teacher from Maharashtra Shriman Chandrakant Kulkarni who donated 51 post – dated cheques of Rs. 5,000/- each for the cleanliness drive out of his total monthly pension of Rs. 16,000/-.
I’ve experienced through ‘Mann Ki Baat’ that even a tiny incident can launch a massive campaign.
Today I felt like sharing it, since I thought that it has been three years, and events & incidents over those three years ran across my mind.
My dear countrymen, we had taken a resolve in last month’s Mann Ki Baat and had decided to observe a 15-day Cleanliness Festival before Gandhi Jayanti.
I noticed something else this time – one is that we clean up a place, and the second is that we become aware and do not spread filth; but if we have to inculcate cleanliness as a habit, we must start an idea- based movement also.
One thing was common and that was to live for the country, do something for the nation; they led the people not by mere sermons but by their actions.
Gandhiji, Jai Prakashji, Deen Dayalji were such great personalities who remained far away from the corridors of power but lived every moment for the people, kept fighting all odds following the principle “Sarv Jan Hitay – Sarv Jan Sukhay”, they kept endeavouring tirelessly.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will surely mention Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel but on 31st October, Run for Unity – Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat – will be organized throughout the country.
I request you too, to feel the “Unity in Diversity” which is not a mere slogan but is a storehouse of enormous energy.
Internalize India within yourselves.
And, who can be a better teacher than experience!
The Indian Army has got two extraordinary brave women officers; they are Lieutenant Swati and Nidhi.
But Swati Mahadik, the wife of martyr colonel Santosh Mahadik – resolved to face the difficult situations and she joined the Indian Army.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has greeted the people on the occasion of Cheti Chand.

You will leave this place with so much curiosity that you will feel like that as a citizen of India the more you know the country, the more you know about every corner of the country, the more you know India’s diversity the more you feel one with the country.
The seed of this value systemis naturally sown within us in every NCC camp.
We don’t even know that how do we develop a strong feeling to do something for India?
Such an eco system, such an environment that makes us think about the country, think about its future and our role, our duties in this thing every single moment.
We are going to go back after getting inspiration for all these things.
NCC cadets participating in the parade at Raj Path and those who did not get the opportunity to participate in the parade or being seen on the Raj Path, those who work in the background, those who labored extremely hard for a month, for every such person, the guests from 10 countries, the entire country and Indian Diaspora spread across the world takes pride in every step taken by you people.
When you showed your extreme courage then every countrymen felt that the courage of the country was going to the top.
This environment, this atmosphere should not be confined to this place only.
The real test begins after that.
NCC is known for its discipline and unity.
NCC is not a mechanism.
NCC is a mission.
Why all these things?
Why the money of the poorest of the poor person of the country is being spent on all these things?
If we leave all these things here and these memories are going to be used just for sharing them with friends for the rest of life then something is missing.
We should take pride in the fact that after the independence of the country the NCC act was enacted before the enactment of rules and regulation for the armed forces.
Nation building was linked with the young generation of the country and given priority over security of the nation.
Today, NCC has completed 70 years.
The journey of seven decades, and millions and millions of NCC cadets like me moved on the path of life by receiving the values of patriotism.
Friends, we get a sense of mission from NCC.
What should be its expanse?
Today, when we are completing 70 years then we should prepare a mission for 75 years with this resolve.
I don’t believe that any youth of my country is willing to tolerate corruption.
The society has a feeling of hatred against corruption.
Will this thing be enough?
Then we will have to continue to wage this battle for a prolonged period, it is not going to stop.
This fight against corruption, this fight against black money is aimed at making the future of the youth of my country.
And if the future of the youth of my country is secured then it is going to make the future of our country.
I know that you will never disappoint me.
The youth of my country will not disappoint me.
I am neither going to ask for votes nor am I going to ask your help so that we can progress on political front.
If I want your help, the help of youth of my country, then I want your help for setting this country free from this corruption which is like a termite.
You might feel that what you could do.
If accountability is there, if transparency is there, then there is an automatic change in the situation.
Whether we will download the BHIM App and make every purchase through BHIM App?
And whether you will insist on using the BHIM App at the shop from where you purchase things, whichever store or mall you may be visiting, whether you will insist on using it or not?
You must do it.
And it can’t be done without the help of my youth.
If my NCC cadets take up this task on a mission mode then no one will have courage to drag the country towards corruption.
Even if an extremely corrupt person succeeds in occupying a high office even then he will be forced to follow the path of honesty.
Sometimes there was a lot of despair in the country that lofty things are discussed against the corruption but nothing could be done against powerful people.
Today, you people have been passing through such a period, you are passing through such a time that at least three chief ministers are behind bars due to corruption.
Now there is no one to protect them.
Please come forward and join me in this fight as a soldier.
If we eradicate these evils then it benefits the most to the poor people of the country.
When the money is spent in the proper manner then a poor household gets the affordable medicine.
When the money is spent in the proper manner then it creates the facilities for providing good schools, good teachers to the children of a poor person.
That day is not far away when the country which will have data will be considered powerful.
In the digital world, in the world of data, Aadhaar has given a big reason to India to take pride in this field.
All this is possible.
My young friends, you people have got a good experience in the life.
You people have got the opportunity to experience the country by living with the people from all corners of the country in a very short span of time.
You people got that feeling; you got a new touch of India.
My best wishes to all of you.

The outrage that singes your being and mine on account of the terrorizing violence replicates itself in the collective inner psyche’ of every citizen of the country; it also echoes in pro-humanity communities of the world, which sincerely believe in humanity.
This martyrdom will keep inspiring us relentlessly to uproot the very base of terrorism; it will fortify our resolve.
The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjanji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring.
He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy; if need be, he himself would go and fight.
These are but living examples before your eyes… these very examples are a source of inspiration for the future of a rising & glowing India.
Tomorrow, that is on the 25th of February, crores of we Indians will dedicate this National Soldiers’ Memorial to our Armed Forces.

The concept of the National Soldiers’ Memorial is based on the notion of four concentric circles, which depicts the journey of a soldier from coming into being, culminating in his martyrdom.
If you take a holistic view, the National Soldiers’ Memorial is sure to turn out to be a sacred site, where people will throng, to get information on our great martyrs, to express their gratitude, to conduct further research on them.
This place stands testimony to a series of sacrifices of men who laid down their lives for the sake of their country, so that we could live, so that the country could be safe & secure, paving the way for development.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for the revised Model Text for the Indian Bilateral Investment Treaty.
The revised Indian model text for Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) will replace the existing Indian Model BIT.
The revised model BIT will be used for re-negotiation of existing BITs and negotiation of future BITs and investment chapters in Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements (CECAs)/ Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPAs) / Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).
The new Indian Model BIT text will provide appropriate protection to foreign investors in India and Indian investors in the foreign country, in the light of relevant international precedents and practices, while maintaining a balance between the investor’s rights and the Government obligations.
A BIT increases the comfort level and boosts the confidence of investors by assuring a level playing field and non-discrimination in all matters while providing for an independent forum for dispute settlement by arbitration.
In turn, BITs help project India as a preferred foreign direct investment (FDI) destination as well as protect outbound Indian FDI.
The essential features of the model BIT include an “enterprise” based definition of investment, non-discriminatory treatment through due process, national treatment, protections against expropriation, a refined Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provision requiring investors to exhaust local remedies before commencing international arbitration, and limiting the power of the tribunal to awarding monetary compensation alone.
Background:- The first BIT was signed by India on March 14, 1994.

Your Excellency Dr. Angela Merkel!
It is a great pleasure for me to join you in Bengaluru.
Welcome to this Indo German Summit.
I fondly recall my visit to the city of Hannover and Hannover Messe in April.
15 States, a number of CEOs and hundreds of companies from India, had participated.
The exposure to Hannover Messe will go a long way in shaping our vision and strategy of manufacturing.
This is particularly important at a time when we are on the path of making India a global manufacturing hub.
Dr. Merkel and Friends!
There is tremendous potential in India-Germany economic collaboration.
About 600 Indo-German Joint ventures are already operating in India.
However, as of now, our economic partnership remains below our full potential.
We are particularly keen to develop the sectors where Germany is strong.
We are working hard to create conducive conditions for the same.
At a time of global slowdown, India represents a bright spot for investments.
We are fortunate to be sailing in the right direction.
The recent data on global economic activity reinforces this assertion.
However, we cannot afford to be complacent.
We are committed to doing everything possible to convert these analyses into reality.
With a very open and global mindset, we have worked aggressively in the last fifteen months to make India an easy place to do business.
We are committed to creating favorable conditions for business and industry because we believe that they are necessary for improving the lives of ordinary citizens in India.
A recent study conducted with the help of the World Bank Group has brought out the urgency among our provincial governments on ease of doing business.
They are moving hand-in-hand with the federal government in this direction in a true spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism.
One of the biggest challenges in India today is to productively employ our youth.
This percentage must reach around 25 in the short and medium term.
With this in view, we have launched the “Make in India” initiative.
Transparent auction and allocation of spectrum and of key natural resources like coal, iron ore and other minerals in the last 15 months have created a level playing field for investors.
We are aware that our domestic financial resources are not sufficient to meet our needs.
We have also refined our FDI Policy for construction and medical devices.
We are keen to build futuristic physical and social infrastructure.
Through self-imposed discipline in the management of our financial resources, we have been able to allocate more resources for infrastructure sectors.
In addition, we are setting up an India Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
We have targeted an annual flow of Rs 20,000 Crore (which is approximately 2.7 billion euros) into this fund from our own resources.
We are putting in place a professional team for asset management.
We have also come up with the mechanism of Tax Free Infrastructure Bonds for projects in rail, road and irrigation sectors.
There were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on the sentiments of foreign investors.
We have taken very decisive steps to remove a number of long pending concerns of investors.
To give you some examples:-
• We have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance;
• Across the board, we have increased the validity period of Industrial Licences;
• We have de-licenced a number of defence items and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate;
• We have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years;
• We have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation and reinforced this position by not going for imposition of Minimum Alternate Tax on FPIs;
• We have notified the regulations for the Alternative Investment Funds allowing foreign investments in such funds;
• We have rationalized the capital gains tax regime for Real Estate Investment Trusts;
• We have modified the Permanent Establishment norms;
• We have also decided to defer the implementation of the General Anti-Avoidance Rules for two years;
We are also keen to see that genuine investors and honest tax payers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters.
As a result of our initiatives, the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment have turned positive.
The growth rate of our GDP is above 7%.
FDI inflows have gone up by 40% compared with previous year’s corresponding period.
Many international financial institutions including the World Bank, IMF, OECD and others are predicting even faster growth in the coming years.
MOODY’s have upgraded the rating of India as positive.
India has improved its UNCTAD ranking of investment attractiveness.
Against 15th so far, now we are at 9th place.
Similarly, in a ranking of the top global destinations for greenfield investment in the first half of 2015, India is at number one.
Foreign Policy magazine of USA has ranked India as number one FDI destination.
Thus, just in Fifteen Months, we have successfully restored the credibility of India in the eyes of global players.
I have always said that government has no business to do business.
Hence, through PPP or otherwise, we are encouraging private investments in areas where earlier only government used to invest.
We are also divesting our stake in the public sector enterprises, to instill market discipline.
A comprehensive National IPR policy is being finalized.
Last week I myself reviewed the situation.
I can say that this will be a progressive, and forward looking policy.
We want your active involvement in translating our dreams into reality.
Our commitment and aggressiveness to achieve the goal in a faster and effective manner offers immense opportunities to German Companies.
More importantly, no one place on the earth can offer the potential for consumption on such a massive scale.
To tap the energy fully, we have launched the Start up India Campaign.
I thank NASSCOM for becoming our active partner in this journey.
Recently, we tried to ignite this energy through an interface of our youth with the eco-system of Silicon Valley.
India, in fact, is on the threshold of a big IT revolution.
We are at the tipping point where technology is going to be leveraged to meet the aspirations of our 1.25 billion citizens.
These initiatives provide additional avenues for investment in modern technology and human resources.
There is a huge domestic market in India.
Unlike a decade ago, talented young minds in India are no longer looking merely for high paying jobs.
Instead, they have now begun taking risks and preferring to become entrepreneurs.
We have witnessed exponential growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past.
Some of these have begun to challenge established global players.
To conclude, I can assure you that we will be open to welcome your ideas, innovations and enterprises.
I can say that, never before, India was so well prepared to absorb talent, technology and investment from outside.
To our understanding, the necessary conditions to propel the Indian economy to a high growth trajectory do exist today.
I am eagerly looking forward to working with you.
While in Bengaluru, I must add that It is the software of India that will move the hardware across the world; It is the talent of India that will master the technology; It is the market of India that will motivate manufacturing.
Therefore, it makes strong business sense to be in India.
It makes even better business sense to Make in India.

The Prime Minister said his Government worked for “Sabka saath, sabka vikas,” and therefore, it was essential for development to reach all parts of the country.
He said the State of Jammu and Kashmir should return once again to the days when people from all parts of India saved money to visit the State.
He said that besides tourism, attention was being given to sectors such as Pashmina, and Saffron.
His Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan;

Business Leaders from both countries;
It is a real pleasure to be with the business community of Japan and India.
That too in the presence of a great friend: Friend of India; Friend of Gujarat and my personal friend Mr. Shinzo Abe Please give a big hand for this great friend and a great leader.
Today, that dream has come true.
I am happy to see so many friends from Japan happily living and doing business in Gujarat.
It also gives me great pleasure to see so many familiar faces here.
I am also happy to see that dedicated townships, clusters and institutions have come up to make the Japanese life and work experience better.
Gujarat’s Industry and Government still cherish the fact that Japan became the first partner country in the Vibrant Gujarat event.
Not only did this partnership continue, but our engagement has kept growing.
This closeness and understanding has helped us bridge a number of gaps in our bilateral relations.
Last year has seen the highest ever disbursement of Official Development Assistance from Japan in a financial year.
Similarly, the number of Japanese companies working in India has gone up steadily in the last few years.
• First is the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project:
• We are grateful for the support of the Japanese Government for this Project.
• It will prepare the Makers of a New India – the highly skilled manpower required to build, operate and maintain the high speed railway.
• Second is the Development of Japanese Industrial Townships: Country-wide, four locations have been finalized.
Apart from Gujarat, they are located in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
• Third is our cooperation in auto-mobiles:
The Suzuki plant at Maandal is exporting cars world-wide, and foundation has been laid for production of Lithium-ion batteries to power the next generation hybrid and electric vehicles.
• Fourth is for Human Resource Development through the Japan-India Institutes of Manufacturing They are being developed by Japanese companies.
In addition to Gujarat, they will be developed in Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.
• You know that the ancient and holy city of Varanasi is my second home.
I have named it Rudraksh – the symbol of love, and a Prasad of Lord Shiva to Humanity.
It will also be a tribute to our shared Buddhist heritage present at Sarnath too.
For Japan’s financial assistance to this project, I extend my warmest personal thanks to Prime Minister Abe. · You have also seen some other announce- -ments for investment by Japanese companies. · On political and strategic side too, this visit of Prime Minister Abe has been very productive.
We have concluded a number of agreements on very important matters.
All this shows the depth of our understanding and the comfort and confidence which we have with each other.
These reforms and initiatives are all aimed at preparing India for the 21st century.
We are also developing India into a knowledge based, skill supported and technology driven society.
A grand beginning has already been made through our drives like Digital India and Skill India.
For the same purpose, we have started the Start-up India campaign.
India is ranked 3rd in the Global Start-Up Eco-system, and has seen a momentous rise in the past couple of years.
The Start-Up India initiative also aims to build a strong eco-system of innovation.
Japan can benefit tremendously with the size and scale of our potentials and skilled hands that India offers!
In fact, all of India’s development agenda is relevant for Japanese companies.
To allow entry of capital and technology, we have worked hard on opening our economy.
Every day we are making it easier to invest and do business in India.
We have already resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies.
We have got very good results of these efforts.
We moved 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank; and We are 3rd among the top 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD the UN Conference on Trade and Development.
With this, we are also moving towards a modern tax regime, which is transparent, stable and predictable.
Today, India has one of the most liberal FDI regimes in the world.
This liberalization has seen India’s FDI reach 60 billion dollars in the last financial year.
These are just a few examples of the direction in which we are moving.
We will do more and more; better and better; faster and faster.
India needs affordable solutions and processes which can ease the delivery of government services to its citizens.
Japan needs opportunities where it can deploy its hard earned knowledge and technology.
With the strength of our friendship and mutual trust, I invite more and more Japanese people and companies to come, live and work in India.
I assure you my support wherever it is required.
The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has congratulated India’s contingent at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.
“India’s contingent at the 2018 Commonwealth Games has made every Indian extremely proud.

Mining, Fertilizers, Textiles, Aviation, Health, Defence, Construction, Real Estate, Food Processing, ऐसा कोई sector नहीं है जिसमें हम reforms न लाए हों।
Bilateral, Multilateral Platforms,
I am happy to be part of this new beginning for Smart Governance in the North East.
The launch of Integrated Command and Control Centres in Gangtok, Namchi, Pasighat, Itanagar and Agartala is a welcome step.
The urban centres of the North East, with their pool of skilled human resource, have the potential to emerge as growth hubs for the entire region.
The Smart City Mission enables cities to identify their potential and challenges.
It catalyses smart solutions for the challenges, through public consultation.
Smart City Command and Control Centres use digital technology to integrate different service networks.
They enable real-time collaboration among departments such as Police, Transport, Power, Water, Sanitation, and Public Safety utilities.
I believe that with the system in place, administrators will be able to monitor city operations better and respond in real time.
The implementation of Integrated Command and Control Centres is gathering pace across India.
As on the First of March 2019, these Centres have already become functional in fifteen Smart Cities.
Work is in progress at fifty other Centres.
I am told that the North-East will have its first completed Smart Command and Control Centre as early as October 2019.
One of the key components of the system is the CCTV Surveillance system for Citizen Safety.
This system is designed to help tackle crime.
The Intelligent Traffic Management System will help ease traffic flow.
The Solid Waste Management component in the Command and Control Centre will boost cleanliness in these cities.
Smart Street Lighting will make our streets safer and citizen friendly.
It will also improve energy efficiency through the conversion to LED systems.
Smart cities are also installing Public-Address Systems and Variable Message Signs to communicate important civic information.
Digital access is an important component of Digital India Mission.
Public Wi-Fi system will provide free internet access to Citizens.
The North-East is an environmentally sensitive region.
The Environmental Monitoring System and Disaster Management modules will give real time information to Citizens and Government.
It will help improve the overall quality of life of Citizens.
As cities start implementing and expanding the different elements of this system, they will be able to improve Ease of Living for their citizens.
I am told that there are over 500 projects with a total worth of nearly 15,000 crore rupees in the ten Smart Cities in the North East.
Work orders have already been issued for 59 of these projects.
I am happy to see Namchi in Sikkim, begin work on its Integrated Water Supply projects, LED Street lights and footpaths.
Water is becoming a huge challenge in our hill cities.
Gangtok has started work on rain water harvesting.
It has also undertaken projects to construct multi-level car parks with Smart Parking features to ease traffic congestion.
Agartala has its own unique challenges due to its saucer-shaped geography that makes it vulnerable to floods.
The city administration has taken up projects to manage the same under the Smart Cities Mission.
Itanagar has plans to improve its city road network through its Smart Roads and Intelligent Traffic and Transport Management system.
Pasighat is addressing the challenges of housing, energy management and business development through key Smart City projects.

The major recommendations of the Sub-Group are as under:
a) No. of Schemes: The total number of schemes should not exceed 30.
b) Categorisation of Schemes: Existing CSSs should be divided into Core and Optional Schemes.
i. Core schemes: Focus of CSSs should be on schemes that comprise the National Development Agenda where the Centre and States will work together in the spirit of Team India.
ii. Core of the Core Schemes: Those schemes which are for social protection and social inclusion should form the core of core and be the first charge on available funds for the National Development Agenda.
iii. Optional Schemes: The Schemes where States would be free to choose the ones they wish to implement.
Funds for these schemes would be allocated to States by the Ministry of Finance as a lump sum.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today inaugurated a hospital in Dickoya in Central Province of Sri Lanka, built with Indian assistance.
Following are some key excerpts from the Prime Minister’s address to an estimated audience of about 30,000 people, mostly Indian Origin Tamils in Central Sri Lanka:
It is a great pleasure to be here today.
And, I am most grateful for your warm and enthusiastic welcome.
People the world over are familiar with famous Ceylon Tea that originates in this fertile land.
What is less known is that it is your sweat and toil that makes the Ceylon Tea the brew of choice for millions around the globe.
If Sri Lanka today is the third largest exporter of tea, it is because of your hard work.
It is your labour of love which is instrumental in Sri Lanka meeting almost 17% of the world’s demand for tea, and earning more than 1.5 billion US dollars in foreign exchange.
You are that indispensable backbone of the thriving Sri Lankan tea industry that justly prides itself on its success and global reach today.
I for one truly appreciate your hard work.
You and I have something in common.
As some of you may have heard, I have a special association with tea.
Chai pe Charcha, or discussions over tea, is not just a slogan.
Rather, a mark of deep respect for the dignity and integrity of honest labour.
Today, we remember your forefathers.
Those men and women of strong will and courage, who undertook the journey of their life from India to then Ceylon.
Their journey may have been uphill and their struggles hard, but they never gave up.
You encountered the stiff challenge of making your own mark and identity in a newly independent nation.
But, you faced them boldly; you fought for your rights, but you did so peacefully.
Kaniyan Pungunranar, a Tamil Scholar had declared more than two millennia ago, Yaathum Oore; Yavarum Kelir, meaning “Every town is hometown and all people are our kin”.
And, you have captured the true spirit of that saying.
You have made Sri Lanka your home.
You are an intrinsic part of the warp and the weft of the social fabric of this beautiful nation.
You are the children of Tamil Thai.
It is a matter of pride that many of you also speak Sinhala.
And, language is much more than a tool for communication.
It defines a culture, forges relationships, joins communities and acts as a strong unifying force.
There is no better sight than a multilingual society living in peace and harmony.
Several Buddhist texts including Jataka tales mention Saint Agastya, whom many consider to be the father of Tamil language.
The Sinhalese Nayak Kings of Kandy had matrimonial alliances with the Nayak Kings of Madurai and Tanjore.
Hindu and Buddhist shrines were both respected and revered.
We need to strengthen, not separate, these threads of unity and harmony.
And, you are perhaps best placed to lead such efforts and make your contribution.
I come from the State of Gujarat in India, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi.
Almost 90 years ago, he visited this beautiful part of Sri Lanka, including Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Badulla, Bandarawela and Hatton.
Gandhiji’s first and only visit to Sri Lanka was about spreading the message of socio-economic development.
In commemoration of that historic visit, the Mahatma Gandhi International Centre was set up with Government of India assistance at Matale in 2015.
You form an important link between Indian and Sri Lankan people and government.
We see you as part of seamless continuum of our ties with this beautiful country.
It is my Government’s priority to nurture these links.
You have kept your bonds with India alive.
You have friends and relatives in India.
India beats in your hearts.
And, I am here to tell you that India fully reciprocates the warmth of your sentiment.
India has also undertaken many projects for your well-being, together with Sri Lankan Government, particularly in education, health and community development sectors.
In the area of livelihood and capacity building, we have set up vocational training centres and 10 English language training centres and labs to help impart suitable skill sets.
Similarly, we have helped set up computer and science labs in plantation schools.
We are also upgrading a number of plantation schools.
Just a while ago, President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and I dedicated to the people a new 150-bed hospital complex in Dickoya, which has been constructed with Indian assistance.
I am also pleased to announce that we have decided to extend the 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service, currently in operation in Western and Southern Provinces, to all the other Provinces as well.
As part of the innovative Indian Housing Project in Sri Lanka, 4000 houses are being constructed in upcountry areas.
We will help you overcome the challenges of your past to realise the promise of your future.
As the great poet Thiruvalluvar said, “Wealth will find its own way to the man of unfailing energy and efforts”.
I am confident that it will be a bright future that matches the dreams and potential of your children and your heritage.

The MoU would lead to develop a joint activity in the field of application of space technologies for the benefit of humanity.
India and Bangladesh have expressed interest to cooperate with each other in the area of space.
The Prime Minister recalled the great women and men who worked hard for India’s freedom.
He said the people of India stand shoulder to shoulder with those affected due to natural disasters, and the tragedy in Gorakhpur.
The Prime Minister noted that the current year is special, because it marks the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement; the 100th anniversary of Champaran Satyagraha; and the 125th anniversary of the celebration of ‘Saarvjanik Ganesh Utsav’ – inspired by Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
The Prime Minister said that the nation had shown its collective strength between 1942 and 1947, culminating in India’s independence.
He said that we must show the same collective determination and resolve to create a New India by 2022.
He emphasized that everyone is equal in our nation, and together we can bring about a qualitative transformation.
Shri Narendra Modi said that India’s security is our priority, and the surgical strike had underscored this.
He added that India’s stature in the world is rising, and several countries are cooperating with India in fighting the menace of terrorism.
On demonetization, he said that those who have looted the nation, and the poor, are not able to sleep peacefully, and honesty is being celebrated today.
He asserted that the fight against black money will continue, and technology will help bring about transparency.
He encouraged people to further promote digital transactions.
The Prime Minister described the implementation of GST as a key illustration of cooperative federalism.
He said the poor are joining the mainstream through initiatives of financial inclusion.

The Prime Minister appreciated the farmers and the agriculture scientists for record crop production this year.
He said the Government had procured 16 lakh tonnes of pulses this year, far in excess of the procurement of previous years.
The Prime Minister said the changing nature of technology is resulting in the requirement of different skill-sets for employment.
He also added that the youth is being nurtured to become job-creators, and not job-seekers.

He said casteism and communalism will not help us.
He strongly condemned the use of violence in the name of faith, and said this will not be accepted in India.

Quoting from scriptures, the Prime Minister said that if we do not take the right step at the right time, we do not achieve desired results.
He said this is the right time for ‘Team India’ to resolve for ‘New India.’
This is expected to help in the efforts being taken to improve the availability of these commodities to general public at reasonable rates, and control the tendencies of hoarding and profiteering.
It has been noticed that the average retail price of sugar has escalated in the recent past, in-spite of adequate availability of sugar stock with the mills.
The price rise appears artificial as being mainly due to hoarding of sugar by traders/sugar dealers etc.
The current decision will be notified by the Central Government and will be communicated to all the States/UTs.
Secretary General, INTERPOL, Mr. Jurgen Stock,
My ministerial colleague Dr. Jitendra Singh,
Other dignitaries on the dais,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am happy to be here today to address the delegates of the sixth Global Focal Point Conference on Asset Recovery, and the Annual Conference of CBI and State Anti-Corruption Bureaus.
I also extend a warm welcome to the delegates from abroad who are attending this Conference.
I hope that your visit to India is pleasant and memorable.
I also congratulate the officers of CBI who have received medals for distinguished service today.
Governments across the world work to transform the lives of the poor and the marginalized.
Corruption is one of the principal challenges to that objective.
We in India are currently in a crucial phase of Nation building.
However, to achieve this objective, it is essential to fight relentlessly against corruption.
The very day that we assumed office, we constituted a Special Investigation Team under the supervision of the Supreme Court to look into the issue.
We have entered into agreements with many countries for exchanging real time information on black money.
The Government has signed the Inter Government Agreement with the United States to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.
This Agreement enables Indian tax authorities to receive financial account information of Indians from foreign countries on an automatic basis.
A comprehensive and deterrent law, the Black Money Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets and Imposition of Tax Act has been enacted.
It provides for stringent penalties and prosecution.
We have also introduced a provision under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for restitution of assets.
This will enable millions of poor investors who have lost money in ponzi schemes to recover a part of their hard earned money.
I hope that the partnership between Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) and Interpol will help in confiscation and recovery of stolen assets.
We are focused on providing system based and policy driven governance.
A governance structure that is sensitive, transparent and accountable.
Let me share an example to illustrate how corruption can be eliminated silently and efficiently by simple technology and policy based initiatives.
When we assumed office, I was informed that cooking gas cylinders were being subsidized to the tune of approximately four hundred rupees per cylinder.
This subsidy was being provided to rich and poor alike.
We decided that the subsidy should be credited directly into bank accounts of consumers with each account being linked to a unique Aadhaar card.
This single intervention has reduced the number of registered consumers claiming gas subsidy by about fifty million.
Subsequently, we also launched a campaign for the “well off” to voluntarily give up cooking gas subsidy.
One of the challenges that we must address is Governance Deficit.
This includes:-
• inadequate capacity to deliver public services effectively and efficiently,
• lack of appropriate policy responses to emerging situations,
• and delays in project implementation,
My Government has taken several steps to make the bureaucracy more efficient performance-oriented and accountable.
The Government is committed to ensuring probity among public servants and to protect them from frivolous allegations.
Equally, the Government is unsparing when it comes to punishing the corrupt.
We have so far removed and ensured pension cuts of 45 senior officers of various services for unsatisfactory performance and delivery in public service.
Globalization of organized crime poses a major threat to economies throughout the world.
It is a well-known fact that ‘dirty money’ drives out ‘good money.’
The dastardly acts committed in Paris a few days ago are a grim reminder that terrorists have shown remarkable flexibility and adaptability in meeting their funding requirements.
They derive funding from a variety of criminal activities which include smuggling of narcotics, bank robbery, vehicle theft, fake currency, or from state sponsors and activities in failed states.
Disrupting fund flows constrains the capabilities of terrorists and reduces their ability to execute attacks.
This involves putting in place both systemic safeguards, and targeted economic sanctions based on credible counter-terrorism intelligence.
Targeting proceeds of crime is an important element in this fight against crime.
Hence, there is an imperative need to focus our efforts to enhance international cooperation in the field of Asset Recovery for fighting crime, corruption and terrorism.
Confiscation of property of offenders not only serves as punishment but also discourages commission of crime.
In fact, Kautilya in his‘Artha Shastra,’ had suggested confiscation of illegitimate income as one of the punishments for corrupt public servants.
I am also pleased to note that the heads of State Anti-Corruption Bureaus and CBI will deliberate on the related theme of tracking proceeds of corruption.
This two decade old forum must not only focus on prosecution of offenders involved in corruption but also modify their Standard Operating Procedures to more effectively target the proceeds of corruption.
Economic liberalism and globalization have drastically increased the ability to park profits of crime anywhere in the world.
Today proceeds of crime can be routed through dozens of countries within seconds.
By a process of layering the money-trail can be concealed.
Investigation agencies are limited by national boundaries.
Our Government is committed to the implementation of a uniform global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information, on a fully reciprocal basis.
This will facilitate exchange of information regarding persons who have concealed their money in offshore financial centres and tax havens.
INTERPOL is playing an increasingly active role in asset recovery.
Since 2009, Global Focal Point Forum is actively promoting the exchange of corruption data among law enforcement agencies and anti-corruption entities worldwide.
In this context mention must be made of INTERPOL’s initiatives such as I-SECOM, a secure web-based encrypted channel for the exchange of sensitive data among the specialized anti-corruption community.
The new INTERPOL notice could add value to asset-tracing investigations and facilitate real time information sharing in complex cases.
I am told that the excellent and proactive cooperation between INTERPOL and Indian investigative agencies has resulted in tracking of many fugitive criminals and their subsequent deportation or extradition.
I would like this cooperation to deepen.
CBI has been effectively assisting the Indian law enforcement agencies and their foreign counterparts in overcoming the barriers that complicate the exchange of investigative information.
I am also informed that CBI has been making use of INTERPOL tools and databases for securing greater cooperation among law enforcement organizations throughout the world.
It has also been consistently partnering INTERPOL Capacity Building Programmes.
We are in the process of establishing an International Centre of Excellence in Investigation at Ghaziabad.
This Centre will render world class Certified Courses on Investigation and Prosecution in specialized and emerging domains of crime including cybercrime, to the Law enforcement community of India and abroad.
A Centralized Technology Vertical to focus on combating new age crimes like cybercrime, is also being planned.
There are several cases in the annals of Indian judicial history in which conviction was secured solely on the basis of forensic expert opinion.
India must, therefore, have adequate facilities to be able to clear the huge backlog of forensic opinion.
The proceeds of crime and corruption are stolen assets.
They do not belong to the country where they are stashed.
They rightfully belong to the citizens of the country from which they have been plundered.
I am well aware of the legal and procedural obstacles and differences in evidentiary standards that hinder Asset Recovery.
To overcome these challenges, Police and Law Enforcement Agencies should forge formal and informal relationships.
I hope this conference provides all of you such an opportunity.
a. Provision of 2G+4G mobile coverage in identified uncovered areas of the State of Meghalaya; and
b. Provision of 2G+4G seamless mobile coverage along the National Highways in Meghalaya.
1. Strengthening of telecom network will result in increase the penetration of mobile connectivity in Meghalaya resulting in affordable and equitable access of communication, information and governance to people.

They also agreed that proper management of the bilateral relationship will be conducive for the development and prosperity of the region, and will create the conditions for the Asian Century.
The two leaders underscored the importance of maintaining peace and tranquility in all areas of the India-China border region in the larger interest of the overall development of bilateral relations.
These include combating diseases, coordinating action for disaster risk reduction and mitigation, addressing climate change and ushering digital empowerment.
They agreed to pool together their expertise and resources in these areas and create a global network dedicated to these challenges for the larger benefit of humanity.
The two leaders highly assessed the opportunity for direct, free and candid exchange of views offered by the Informal Summit and agreed on the utility of holding more such dialogues in the future.
Greeting the jawans on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that their devotion to duty in the remote icy heights, is enabling the strength of the nation, and securing the future and the dreams of 125 crore Indians.
He said that Diwali is the festival of lights; it spreads the light of goodness and dispels fear.
He said that the jawans, through their commitment and discipline, are also helping to spread the sense of security and fearlessness among the people.
The Prime Minister recalled that he has been visiting soldiers on Diwali, ever since he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
He also spoke of his interactions with the jawans of ITBP, years ago when he was part of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.
The Prime Minister said India is taking great strides forward in the defence sector.

The JIN includes interpretative notes to be jointly adopted for many clauses, including, the definition of investor, definition of investment, exclusion of taxation measures, Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET), National Treatment (NT) and Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment, expropriation, essential security interests and Settlement of Disputes between an Investor-and a Contracting Party.
Joint Interpretative Statements in general play an important supplementary role in strengthening the investment treaty regime.
With increasing Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) disputes, issuance of such statements is likely to have strong persuasive value before tribunals.
With a view to achieve above mentioned benefits, Deptt. of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource Development has brought about this amendment.
Further, the courses of such recognised Institutions/Universities have to be permitted under section 15, of the NCTE Act.

He said these projects will improve ease of living.
Making a strong pitch to rise above the “administrative mechanisms of earlier centuries”, the Prime Minister said the Secretaries had an opportunity to transform the lives of one-sixth of humanity.
He asked them to identify concrete goals to be achieved by 2022 – the seventy-fifth anniversary of independence.
The Prime Minister exhorted the Secretaries to work beyond the silos of their respective Ministries for the development of the country.
Giving examples such as Financial Inclusion (Jan Dhan Yojana) and Universal Immunization (Mission Indradhanush), the Prime Minister said the some of the best results in the last three years had been achieved when the entire Government machinery worked in unison, as a team.
He said institutions must be made outcome-oriented.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for signing of an Inter-Governmental Agreement between India and Mauritius on cooperation in cooperatives and related fields.
A work plan will be drawn up by mutual Agreement between the two parties to give effect to the objectives of this Agreement.
The Government of Mauritius has shown keen Interest to develop Institutional Mechanism between Cooperative Development Fund (CDF) set up by it and National Cooperative Union of India (NCUI) so as to benefit from NCUI’s experience in Cooperative Development.
A delegation of two senior officials from the Mauritius Government visited cooperative organisations of India to explore the possibilities of bilateral cooperation in the field of cooperatives.
The schemes are – Gold Monetization Scheme, Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme, and Indian Gold Coins.
In his remarks on the occasion, the Prime Minister described the schemes as an example of “sone pe suhaaga” (icing on the cake).
He said the gold available with the country should be put to productive use, and these schemes show us the way to achieve this goal.
The Prime Minister spoke of the great bond of trust that the family goldsmith enjoys in India.
He said that once the goldsmiths of India gain familiarity with the schemes, they could become the biggest agents of these schemes.
Shri Narendra Modi described the launch of the India Gold Coins, bearing the Ashok Chakra, as a matter of pride for the nation.
He said people would no longer have to depend on foreign minted gold bullion or coins.
Union Finance Minister Shri Arun Jaitley, Union Minister of State (I/c) for Commerce Smt.
Nirmala Sitharaman, and Union Minister of State for Finance Shri Jayant Sinha were present on the occasion.
The certificate had been given to the Prime Minister in the presence of the Prime Minister of UK, David Cameron, during his visit to London last month.
The function was organised at Bhuj, Gujarat.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said Shyamji Krishna Varma was a learned man, who had received great recognition in Kashi.
He had actively taken up the cause of Indian Independence in London.
The Prime Minister said he is visiting Kutch to attend the conference of Directors General of Police, which had always been held in Delhi, until he had taken the initiative to shift it out of the Capital last year.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the introduction of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites Remains (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the Parliament.
To make way for certain constructions limited strictly to public works and projects essential to public within the prohibited area, the following amendments have been approved:
i) Insertion of a new definition of “public works” in section 2 of the Act.
iii) Insertion of a new clause (ea) to section 20-I of the principal Act
The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites Remains Act, 1958 (as amended in the year 2010) prohibits grant of any permission for new construction within the prohibited area of a centrally protected monument/ site.
Prohibition of new construction within prohibited area is adversely impacting various public works and developmental projects of the Central Government.
This would be done by amending the decision of the Union Cabinet taken in its meeting held on 15.06.2016 for removal of difficulties experienced in effective implementation of this decision.
The decision will make available more experienced doctors for patient / clinical care, medical teaching activities and implementation of National Health Programmes etc., which is likely to benefit society at large.
The benefits of this proposal will percolate down the line throughout the country.
In order to tackle the problem of shortage of doctors, low joining and high attrition rate in Central Health Service, Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 15.06.2016, approved increase in age of superannuation of doctors of the Central Health Service to 65 years.
Subsequently, in its meeting held on 27.09.2017, the Union Cabinet increased age of superannuation of doctors working in various other Ministries/Departments including those of Indian Railways, AYUSH, Central Universities and NTs, etc. to 65 years.
At present, Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 4 at Delhi Cantt has been functioning from a temporary re-appropriated building in Survey No. 14, Delhi Cantt., since its establishment in 1994.

Construction of own permanent school building by KVS will provide proper and comfortable academic environment with all required amenities for the school going children of serving personnel families, ex-servicemen families and children of civilians in and around Delhi Cantt.
This is the last edition of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ this year and it’s a coincidence that this day happens to be the last day of the year of 2017.
The pious occasion of Christmas reminds us of the great teachings of Jesus Christ who laid much emphasis on the spirit of service, ‘Sewa bhaav’.
Be it any religion, caste or creed, tradition or colour in this world; the spirit of service is an invaluable hallmark of the highest human values.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhans used to cite, ‘serve living beings as if worshipping the almighty.
The inference is that the world over, these are shared, common human values.
The 1st of January, 2018, i.e. tomorrow, in my view, is a special day.
One should decide one’s own path and also decide a way for connecting along those attached to one and the Caravan should get going.
Right now, while taking to you I got an idea whether we could organize a mock parliament in every district of India?
I am reminded of one Sanskrit Shloka-
I talked to them, there was no sign of despair; there was only enthusiasm, optimism, energy, dreams and a sense of resolve.
One police officer P. Vijayan initiated a programme Punyam Poonkavanam and commenced a voluntary campaign of creating awareness on cleanliness.
Every devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a part of the Lord’s worship.
However big a celebrity be, or however rich one might be or however high an official be – each one contributes as an ordinary devotee in this Punyan Poonkavanam programme and becomes a part of this cleanliness drive.
Who would have drafted such rules?
And when I went into the depth of the matter I was surprised to find that – even after seventy years of our independence, we were the ones who had imposed these restrictions.
Today, Muslim women can perform Haj without ‘mahram’ or male Guardian and I am happy to note that this time about thirteen hundred Muslim women have applied to perform Haj without ‘mahram’ and women from different parts of the country from Kerala to North India, have expressed their wish to go for the Haj pilgrimage.
We have gathered at a very auspicious time.
Yesterday my Telugu sisters and brothers celebrated the festival of Bhogi.
Friends in the northern part of India, especially Punjab marked Lohri.
Today is Makar Sankranti.
In Gujarat, the sky is fully of kites on this day, which is also known as Uttarayan.
Harmony with nature is the strength of our culture, our traditions.
From north to south, east to west, we can see how there is a festive spirit across the nation.
Festivals are celebrations of life.
My greetings to people across India on all these festivals.
Makar Sankranti marks the transition of the Sun into the zodiac sign of Makara Rashi on its celestial path.
For most people, Makar Sankranti means a break from the harrowing winter and warmer, brighter days.
Some of the festivals we celebrate today are harvest festivals.
We pray that these festivals bring prosperity and joy in the lives of our farmers, who work hard to keep our nation fed.
I wish I could be present with you in person – but the exigencies of work did not so permit.
I pay my tribute to my dear friend Sri Cho Ramaswamy on the 47th anniversary of Thuglak.
He was one of the most multi-faceted personalities I have ever come across.
He was an actor, a director, a journalist, an editor, a writer, a playwright, a politician, a political commentator, a cultural critic, a highly talented writer, a religious and social critic, a lawyer and so much more.
Of all his roles, his role as the editor of the Thuglak magazine was the jewel in the crown.
For 47 years the Thuglak magazine played a stellar role in the cause of safeguarding democratic values and national interest.
Thuglak and Cho – it is difficult to imagine one without the other.
For nearly five decades, he was in charge of Thuglak.
To understand him, one needs to understand his courage, conviction, his sense of nationalism which went beyond parochial, regional, linguistic and other divisions.
His greatest achievement is that he made Thuglak a weapon against all divisive forces.
He was fighting for a clean and non-corrupt political system.
In that struggle, he never spared anyone.
The Nation was his central message.
This is reflected in his writings, in the movies, plays and television serials he directed, in the movies for which he wrote the screenplay.
His satire made his criticism loveable even to those he criticized.
That was a gift from the divine to him, which he used only to promote public interest.
It was his gift also to communicate ideas in one cartoon or in one sentence which a book or volumes of books could not.
I am reminded of one incident related to Cho.
Once some people annoyed with Cho started pelting eggs.
On this Cho said “Aiyya, why throw raw eggs at me when you can make me an omelette.”
The pelters started laughing.
He had this incredible ability to mould conditions in his favour.
Thuglak was a platform for all.
Cho would carry views contrary, even hostile to him, and even abusive of him in his own magazine.
This made no one excluded in Thuglak.
Even those he criticized would find their views carried with the same prominence as Cho’s in Thuglak.
This is the truest democratic spirit in media and in public life.
In my opinion, his thought and contributions were not merely limited to Tamil milieu and Tamil people.
He inspired many generations of aspiring journalists and politicians spanning many societies in India.
And all of us know that Thuglak magazine was not a mere political commentary.
It was the ears and eyes of millions of Tamil people.
Cho, through Thuglak, was the connecting bridge between masses and rulers.
I am glad that Thuglak will continue its journey in objective journalism as envisaged by Cho.
Those who have inherited the legacy of Thuglak have great responsibility on their shoulders.
To be guided by Cho’s vision and commitment will be a big challenge.
Adherence to this vision will be a great service to the people of Tamil Nadu.
I wish Mr. Gurumurthy and his team all the very best in this endeavour.
Knowing Gurumurthy ji, I am confident that he will be successful.
Humour brings happiness in our lives.
Humour is the best healer.
The power of a smile or the power of laughter is more than the power of abuse or any other weapon.
Humour builds bridges instead of breaking them.
Humour brings out human creativity.
We are living in an age where one speech or one event can create multiple memes, forwards.
I have participated in Thuglak’s annual readers’ meet before, in person in Chennai.
Since you have a tradition at this event to play verses from the Shrimad Bhagwad Gita in Mr. Cho’s voice, let me end with a Shlok in Mr. Cho’s honour:
The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the creation of the Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) to give a major push for creation of high quality infrastructure in premier educational institutions.
The HEFA would be jointly promoted by the identified Promoter and the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) with an authorised capital of Rs.2,000 crore.
The Government equity would be Rs.1,000 crore.
The HEFA would be formed as a SPV within a PSU Bank/ Government-owned-NBFC (Promoter).
The HEFA would finance the civil and lab infrastructure projects through a 10-year loan.
The principal portion of the loan will be repaid through the ‘internal accruals’ (earned through the fee receipts, research earnings etc) of the institutions.
The Government would service the interest portion through the regular Plan assistance.
All the Centrally Funded Higher Educational Institutions would be eligible for joining as members of the HEFA.
For joining as members, the Institution should agree to escrow a specific amount from their internal accruals to HEFA for a period of 10 years.
This secured future flows would be securitised by the HEFA for mobilising the funds from the market.
Each member institution would be eligible for a credit limit as decided by HEFA based on the amount agreed to be escrowed from the internal accruals.
I am delighted that we are meeting again as Heads of Government after ten years.
As I had reflected in my letter on the 70th anniversary of the United Nations, we live in a fundamentally different world from the time the UN was born.
The number of Member States has grown four-fold.
Threats to peace and security have become more complex, unpredictable and undefined.
Cyber and Space are entirely new frontiers of opportunities and challenges.
It will carry greater credibility and legitimacy and will be more representative and effective in addressing the challenges of the 21st century.
After decades, we finally see some movement.
The 69th Session of the General Assembly has taken a significant step forward to commence text-based negotiations.
This would not have been possible but for the dynamic leadership of H.E. Mr. Sam Kutesa and Ambassador Courtney Rattray.
However, this is just the first step.
We should aim to take this process to its logical conclusion during the 70th session.
This would enable the Ministry of Railways to implement the recommendations contained in Para Nos. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the Railway Convention Committee (2014)’s first report.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Rajasva Gyan Sangam at New Delhi, and addressed the tax administrators of both the Union and State Governments.
The Prime Minister exhorted the officers to improve their work-culture, to incorporate both a “sense of urgency”, and “measurability”, in their performance.
Mentioning the benefits of the GST, the Prime Minister said that besides economic integration of the country, and transparency in the system; more than 17 lakh new traders have been brought into the indirect tax system within two months.
The Prime Minister said that in order to enable all traders to take maximum benefit of GST, we should work towards ensuring that all traders, including even relatively smaller traders with a turnover below Rs. 20 lakhs, should register with the GST system.
He asked the officers to make efforts in this regard by designing a system for this category.
He said that the Union Government is working towards creation of an environment which shatters the confidence of the corrupt, and instills confidence and trust among the honest taxpayer.
In this regard, he mentioned steps taken by the Union Government, such as demonetization, and implementation of stringent laws against black money and benami property.
The Prime Minister said human interface must be kept to a minimum in the tax administration’s dealings.
He asked for a push to be given to “e-assessment” and anonymity of proceedings using technology, so that vested interests do not impede the due course of law.
Shri Narendra Modi expressed his dismay at the huge pendency of tax-related cases in adjudication and appeal.
The Prime Minister asked officers to use data analytical tools to proactively track and determine undeclared income and wealth.
He said that though efforts to increase tax revenue are made by officers each year, the estimated amounts of tax that should accrue to the system, are often not realised.
The Prime Minister asked officers to come up with a time-bound solution to ‘tax raised and not realised’, and asserted that the honest cannot continue to pay the price for the misdeeds of the dishonest.
In this regard he also suggested complete reworking of human resource management in the tax departments to strengthen the data analytics and investigation wing.

The Amendment will strengthen data collection mechanism in the State of Jammu & Kashmir.
The Amendment will:
(a) Provide for extending the jurisdiction of the Act to Jammu & Kashmir State in respect of matters not reserved for the State as per the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954;
(b) Provide for appointing a nodal officer at the Centre and in each State/Union Territory to effectively coordinate data collection activities and provide consultation to Government Departments for avoiding unnecessary duplication, etc.

“On his Jayanti, I bow to Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee .
I am deeply honoured by the invitation to address this Joint Meeting of the U.S. Congress.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker for opening the doors of this magnificent Capitol.
This temple of democracy has encouraged and empowered other democracies the world over.
It manifests the spirit of this great nation, which in Abraham Lincoln’s words, “was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”
In granting me this opportunity, you have honoured the world’s largest democracy and its 1.25 billion people.
As a representative of world’s largest democracy, it is indeed a privilege to speak to the leaders of its oldest.
Mr. Speaker,
Two days ago, I began my visit by going to the Arlington National Cemetery -the final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land.
I honoured their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy.
It was also the seventy-second Anniversary of the D-Day.
On that day, thousands from this great country fought to protect the torch of liberty on the remote shores of a land that they did not know.
They sacrificed their lives so that the world lives in freedom.
I applaud …India applauds, the great sacrifices of the men and women from ‘The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave’ in service of mankind.
India knows what this means because our soldiers too have fallen in distant battlefields for the same ideals.
That is why the threads of freedom and liberty form a strong bond between our two democracies.
Our nations may have been shaped by differing histories, cultures, and faiths.
Yet, our belief in democracy for our nations and liberty for our countrymen is common.
The idea that all citizens are created equal is a central pillar of the American constitution.
Our founding fathers too shared the same belief and sought individual liberty for every citizen of India.
There were many who doubted India when, as a newly independent nation, we reposed our faith in democracy.
Indeed, wagers were made on our failure.
But, the people of India did not waver.
Our founders created a modern nation with freedom, democracy, and equality as the essence of its soul.
And, in doing so, they ensured that we continued to celebrate our age old diversity.
Today, across its streets and institutions, in its villages and cities, anchored in equal respect for all faiths; and in the melody of hundreds of its languages and dialects.
India lives as one; India grows as one; India celebrates as one.
Modern India is in its 70th year.
For my government, the Constitution is its real holy book.
And, in that holy book, freedom of faith, speech and franchise, and equality of all citizens, regardless of background, are enshrined as fundamental rights.
800 million of my countrymen may exercise the freedom of franchise once every five years.
But, all the 1.25 billion of our citizens have freedom from fear, a freedom they exercise every moment of their lives.
Engagement between our democracies has been visible in the manner in which our thinkers impacted one another, and shaped the course of our societies.
Thoreau’s idea of civil disobedience influenced our political thoughts.
And, similarly the call by the great sage of India Swami Vivekananda to embrace humanity was most famously delivered in Chicago.
Gandhi’s non-violence inspired the heroism of Martin Luther King.
Today, a mere distance of 3 miles separates the Martin Luther King memorial at Tidal Basin from the statue of Gandhi at Massachusetts Avenue.
This proximity of their memorials in Washington mirrors the closeness of ideals and values they believed in.
The genius of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was nurtured in the years he spent at the Columbia University a century ago.
The impact of the U.S. constitution on him was reflected in his drafting of the Indian constitution some three decades later.
Our independence was ignited by the same idealism that fuelled your struggle for freedom.
No wonder then that former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee called India and the U.S. ‘natural allies’.
No wonder that the shared ideals and common philosophy of freedom shaped the bedrock of our ties.
No wonder then, that President Obama has called our ties the defining partnership of the 21st century.
More than fifteen years ago, Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee stood here and gave a call to step out of the ‘shadow of hesitation’ of the past.
The pages of our friendship since then tell a remarkable story.
Today, our relationship has overcome the hesitations of history.
Comfort, candour and convergence define our conversations.
Through the cycle of elections and transitions of Administrations the intensity of our engagements has only grown.
And, in this exciting journey, the U.S. Congress has acted as its compass.
You helped us turn barriers into bridges of partnership.
In the fall of 2008, when the Congress passed the India-U.S. Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, it changed the very colours of leaves of our relationship.
We thank you for being there when the partnership needed you the most.
You have also stood by us in times of sorrow.
India will never forget the solidarity shown by the U.S. Congress when terrorists from across our border attacked Mumbai in November of 2008.
And for this, we are grateful.
I am informed that the working of the U.S. Congress is harmonious.
I am also told that you are well-known for your bipartisanship.
Well, you are not alone.
Time and again, I have also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament, especially in our Upper House.
So, as you can see, we have many shared practices.
As this country knows well, every journey has its pioneers.
Very early on, they shaped a development partnership even when the meeting ground was more limited.
The genius of Norman Borlaug brought the Green Revolution and food security to India.
The excellence of the American Universities nurtured Institutes of Technology and Management in India.
Our S&T collaboration continues to helps us in cracking the age-old problems in the fields of public health, education, food, and agriculture.
Ties of commerce and investment are flourishing.
We trade more with the U.S. than with any other nation.
And, the flow of goods, services and capital between us generates jobs in both our societies.
As in trade, so in defence.
India exercises with the United States more than we do with any other partner.
Defence purchases have moved from almost zero to ten billion dollars in less than a decade.
Our cooperation also secures our cities and citizens from terrorists, and protects our critical infrastructure from cyber threats.
Civil Nuclear Cooperation, as I told President Obama yesterday, is a reality.
Mr. Speaker,
Our people to people links are strong; and there is close cultural connect between our societies.
And, no Mr. Speaker, we have not yet claimed intellectual property right on Yoga.
Connecting our two nations is also a unique and dynamic bridge of three million Indian Americans.
Today, they are among your best CEOs; academics; astronauts; scientists; economists; doctors; even spelling bee champions.
They are your strength.
They are also the pride of India.
They symbolize the best of both our societies.
My understanding of your great country began long before I entered public office.
Long before assuming office, I travelled coast to coast, covering more than 25 States of America.
I realized then that the real strength of the U.S. was in the dreams of its people and the boldness of their ambitions.
Today, Mr. Speaker, a similar spirit animates India.
Our 800 million youth, especially, are particularly impatient.
India is undergoing a profound social and economic change.
A billion of its citizens are already politically empowered.
My dream is to economically empower them through many social and economic transformations.
And, do so by 2022, the seventy-fifth anniversary of India’s independence.
These are not just aspirations; they are goals to be reached in a finite time-frame.
And, to be achieved with a light carbon foot print, with greater emphasis on renewables.
In every sector of India’s forward march, I see the U.S. as an indispensable partner.
Many of you also believe that a stronger and prosperous India is in America’s strategic interest.
Let us work together to convert shared ideals into practical cooperation.
There can be no doubt that in advancing this relationship, both nations stand to gain in great measure.
As the U.S. businesses search for new areas of economic growth, markets for their goods, a pool of skilled resources, and global locations to produce and manufacture, India could be their ideal partner.
India’s strong economy, and growth rate of 7.6% per annum, is creating new opportunities for our mutual prosperity.
Transformative American technologies in India and growing investment by Indian companies in the United States both have a positive impact on the lives of our citizens.
Today, for their global research and development centres, India is the destination of choice for the U.S. companies.
The 21st century has brought with it great opportunities.
But, it also comes with its own set of challenges.
Inter-dependence is increasing.
But, while some parts of the world are islands of growing economic prosperity; other are mired in conflicts.
In Asia, the absence of an agreed security architecture creates uncertainty.
Threats of terror are expanding, and new challenges are emerging in cyber and outer-space.
And, global institutions conceived in 20th century, seem unable to cope with new challenges or take on new responsibilities.
It can also help ensure security of the sea lanes of commerce and freedom of navigation on seas.
But, the effectiveness of our cooperation would increase if international institutions framed with the mindset of the 20th century were to reflect the realities of today.
Before arriving in Washington D.C., I had visited Herat in Western Afghanistan to inaugurate Afghan-India Friendship Dam, a 42 MW hydro-electric project built with Indian assistance.
I was also there on the Christmas day last year to dedicate to that proud nation its Parliament, a testimony to our democratic ties.
Afghans naturally recognize that the sacrifices of American have helped create a better life.
But, your contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated even beyond.
India too has made an enormous contribution and sacrifices to support our friendship with Afghan people.
A commitment to rebuild a peaceful, and stable and prosperous Afghanistan our shared objective.
Yet, Distinguished Members, not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere in South Asia, and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat.
But, it’s philosophy is common: of hate, murder and violence.
Although it’s shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India’s neighbourhood.
I commend the members of the U.S. Congress for sending a clear message to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains.
Refusing to reward them is the first step towards holding them accountable for their actions.
The fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels.
And, the traditional tools of military, intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight.
We have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it.
The need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation.
And, base it on a policy:
Terrorism must be delegitimized.
The benefits of our partnership extend not just to the nations and regions that need it most.
We are also one of the largest contributors of troops to UN Peace Keeping Operations.
Often, India and the U.S. have combined their strengths in science, technology and innovation to help fight hunger, poverty, diseases and illiteracy in different parts of the world.
The success of our partnership is also opening up new opportunities for learning, security and development from Asia to Africa.
And, the protection of environment and caring for the planet is central to our shared vision of a just world.
For us in India, to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient belief.
And, to take from nature only what is most essential is part of our civilizational ethos.
Our partnership, therefore, aims to balance responsibilities with capabilities.
And, it also focuses on new ways to increase the availability and use of renewable energy.
A strong U.S. support for our initiative to form an International Solar Alliance is one such effort.
We are working together not just for a better future for ourselves, but for the whole world.
This has also been the goal of our efforts in G-20, East Asia Summit and Climate Change summits.
Mr. Speaker and Distinguished Members
As we deepen our partnership, there would be times when we would have differing perspectives.
But, since our interests and concerns converge, the autonomy in decision making and diversity in our perspectives can only add value to our partnership.
So, as we embark on a new journey, and seek new goals, let us focus not just on matters routine but transformational ideas.
Ideas which can focus:
And, important for the success of this journey would be a need to view it with new eyes and new sensitivities.
When we do this, we will realise the full promise of this extraordinary relationship.
My final thoughts and words would reiterate that our relationship is primed for a momentous future.
The constraints of the past are behind us and foundations of the future are firmly in place.
In the lines of Walt Whitman,
And to that, if I might add, there is a new symphony in play.
Thank you Mr. Speaker and Distinguished members for this honour.

Hers was a life devoted to the empowerment of the poor and marginalised.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I welcome you all to New Delhi for this landmark conference, the first after the adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
I commend the national disaster risk management agencies, their governments in the Asia-Pacific region, the United Nations, and other stakeholders for coming together for this important cause.
Apart from the Sendai Framework, the international community adopted two other major frameworks to shape the future of humanity:
– the Sustainable Development Goals,
– and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
The spirit of inter-connectedness, highlighted in the film, is the hallmark of these global frameworks.
The success of each one of these depends on the success of the other two.
Disaster Risk Reduction has a pivotal role in supporting adaptation to climate change as well as sustainable development.
It is in this context that this conference becomes timely and relevant.
Many countries in our region have transformed their economies and become engines of global economic growth.
Hundreds of millions of our people have been lifted out of poverty.
The Asia-Pacific region has been a global leader in more ways than one.
But we must not take this progress for granted.
There are challenges as well.
I have seen for myself the human suffering caused by disasters.
I witnessed the Gujarat earthquake of 2001, and later, as Chief Minister of the State, I worked with my people to support post-earthquake recovery.
This was not limited only to owner driven reconstruction of houses, but also to construction of community buildings.
For example, when we entrusted the community the task of reconstructing a school, the earthquake-resistant building was completed in time, at a lesser cost, and the savings were returned to Government.
We in Asia have learnt from disasters.
A quarter century ago, only a handful of Asian nations had national disaster management institutions.
Today, over thirty Asian countries have dedicated institutions leading disaster risk management efforts.
This would be an occasion to celebrate the huge improvements we have made in tsunami early warning.
In December 2004, the Indian Ocean Tsunami caught us unprepared, and there was no warning.
We now have a fully functional Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System.
Along with its Australian and Indonesian counterparts, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services is mandated to issue regional tsunami bulletins.
Similar progress has been made in many countries.
For example, after the 1991 cyclone, the Government of Bangladesh launched a large community-based cyclone preparedness programme.
It led to a significant reduction in loss of lives from cyclones.
The Asia-Pacific is rapidly urbanizing.
Perhaps within a decade more people in the region will live in cities than in villages.
This will ensure that all development projects – airports, roads, canals, hospitals, schools, bridges – are built to appropriate standards and contribute to the resilience of communities they seek to serve.
This is a smart strategy, which pays off in the long term.
All our public expenditure must take into account risk considerations.
In India, the ‘housing for all’ programme and ‘smart cities’ initiative represent such opportunities.
This will help generate new knowledge for hazard risk assessment, disaster resilient technologies and mechanisms for integrating risk reduction in infrastructure financing.
We need to think big and also think innovatively.
States have an important role in not just regulating but also encouraging coverage for those who need it the most.
In India, we have taken bold steps to ensure financial inclusion and risk insurance for the poorest.
Women are disproportionately affected by disasters.
We must train a large number of women volunteers to support special needs of women affected by disasters.
We need women engineers, masons and building artisans supporting reconstruction, and women self help groups assisting livelihood recovery.
Based on these, in India, we have mapped seismic zones, with five as highest seismic risk and two as low risk.
For disaster risk related to other hazards such as chemical hazards, forest fires, cyclones, different types of floods, we need to evolve similar globally accepted risk categories.
This will help us ensure that we have a common understanding of the nature and severity of disaster risks in different parts of the world.
Fifth, leverage technology to enhance the efficiency of our disaster risk management efforts.
An e-platform that brings together organizations and individuals and helps them map and exchange expertise, technology and resources would go a long way in maximizing our collective impact.
Sixth, develop a network of universities to work on disaster issues.
After all, universities have social responsibilities too.
Over the first five years of the Sendai Framework, we should develop a global network of universities working together on problems of disaster risk management.
Universities located in coastal areas could specialize in managing risks from coastal hazards, and the ones located in the hill cities could focus on mountain hazards.
Seventh, utilize the opportunities provided by social media and mobile technologies.
We must recognize the potential of social media and develop applications for all aspects of disaster risk management.
Eighth, build on local capacity and initiative.
Over the last two decades, most community based efforts have been confined to disaster preparedness and contingency planning for the short term.
Response agencies need to interact with their communities, and make them familiar with the essential drill of disaster response.
Ninth, ensure that the opportunity to learn from a disaster is not wasted.
Post-disaster recovery is an opportunity to not just ‘build back better’ in terms of physical infrastructure, but also in terms of improved institutional systems for managing risk.
For this we need to put in place systems that can quickly provide risk assessments.
India will work with partner countries and multilateral development agencies to establish a facility for technical support to post-disaster reconstruction of houses.
Armed Forces protect nation states against external security threats.
But to deal with disasters, we need to equip society with the right education.
We have to wholeheartedly embrace the spirit of Sendai, which calls for an all-of-society approach to disaster risk management.
In India, we are committed to walk the talk on the implementation of Sendai Framework.
In June this year, India’s National Disaster Management Plan was released which is aligned with the priorities set out in the Sendai Framework.
The capabilities of this satellite and other space-based technologies can support the full disaster risk management cycle – risk assessment, risk mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.
India is ready to make its space capabilities available to any country for purposes of disaster risk management.
I am sure, this conference will energize our efforts and the outcomes of the conference will provide a solid blueprint for collective action.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the MoU on Cooperation in the field of Mass Media between India and Bangladesh.
Salient features of the MoU
The main areas of cooperation are:
i. Both the countries to facilitate training/study tour of personnel in the field of mass media and public relations.
ii. Encouraging the exchange of experts in the field of Mass Media
iii. Encourage cooperation between educational, training and research institutions in the field of Mass Media & Communication.
Also facilitating exchange of publications generated by these institutions.
iv. Co-operation and Sharing experiences in the field of regulations of the Mass Media activities and statistical data relating to the Mass Media.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and United States Geological Survey (USGS) for Cooperation in the exchange and use of U.S. Land Remote Sensing Satellite Data.
The MoU was signed on 9th July 2016 at Bengaluru.
Data from Landsat series of satellites operated by USGS was used by Indian scientists during the inception of Indian remote sensing programme.
ISRO received Landsat data during 1984 to 2001 through its ground station at Shadnagar.
USGS has launched Landsat -8 satellite in February 2013.
ISRO expressed interest in direct reception of the Landsat-8 data in India, while USGS expressed interest in obtaining data from ISRO’s RESOURCESAT-2 satellite.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its ex-post facto approval to provide an additional 50 days of unskilled manual work in the financial year over and above the 100 days assured to job card holders, in such rural areas where drought or natural calamities have been notified.
This will enable States to provide additional wage employment to the rural poor in drought affected areas.
The poorest rural households will benefit from this, as it will help in immediate absorption of rural seasonal unemployment, and reduce rural distress.
To provide immediate relief to farmers, in view of the deficit monsoon during Kharif 2015, the Government of India has already taken a number of decisions.
Orders on these measures have already been issued to all State Governments, which will implement them on the basis of assessed need.
The various decisions are:-
1. Diesel Subsidy Scheme for farmers in affected areas: It has been decided to provide diesel subsidy to farmers to enable them to provide life saving irrigation through diesel pump sets in drought and deficit rainfall areas to protect standing crops (allocation of Rs.100 crore).
Farmers in the affected regions will be covered during the current South-West monsoon period till 30th September, 2015.
It is proposed to provide 50 percent subsidy on the cost of diesel (Rs 2000 per hectare) to affected farmers, limited to a maximum of two hectares per farmer.
In order to compensate farmers in drought affected districts for the additional expenditure incurred in the sowing and /or purchasing appropriate varieties of drought resistant seeds, it has been decided to raise the extant ceiling on seed subsidy by 50 percent over existing levels for distribution in drought notified districts.
The enhancement is valid till 31.12.2015.
3. Interventions for saving perennial horticulture crops: Appropriate input support measures will be provided to rejuvenate water stressed horticulture crops, with an additional allocation of Rs.150 crore.
The scheme is to be implemented in all drought affected districts / blocks in the country which are covered under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), being implemented by Dept. of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare.
4. Implementation of additional fodder development programme: Assistance will be provided for additional interventions for production of fodder for mitigating adverse impact of drought on livestock (allocation of Rs.50 crore).
Assistance so provided through subsidy shall be shared between the Government of India and the State Government/UT Administration concerned on 50:50 basis.
10 percent of the allocation under Centrally Sponsored Scheme may be utilized in flexible manner by States to meet contingent requirement arising out of deficient rains.
6. Crop contingency plan: Ministry of Agriculture, through ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Hyderabad has prepared detailed crop Contingency Plans for 600 districts.
As seen from the experience of last year, these are highly useful in case of a deviant monsoon.
These plans are available at the website of Dept. of Agriculture & Cooperation, Minstry of Agriculture as well as Central Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Hyderabad.
7. Advisories to the states: State Governments have already been advised to initiate advance remedial action e.g. constructing water harvesting structures under MGNREGA and other such schemes, promoting agronomic practices for moisture conservation, promoting cultivation of less water consuming crops and restoring irrigation infrastructure by desilting canals, energizing tube-wells, replacing/repairing faulty pumps.
9. SMS Advisory: The Ministry, through the m-kisan portal sends SMS advisories to registered farmers.
These advisories include weather based SMS advisories, advisories to suggest measures to minimize adverse impact of extreme weather event.
Ministry through various operators has sent about 700 crores SMS in the last one year.
These SMS are sent by ICAR/SAU, KVK, AMFU etc. and district level state Government officials.
10. Crisis management plan for drought for the year 2015: A Crisis Management Plan (CMP) for Drought has been in place and is available at the website of Dept. of Agriculture & Cooperation, Min. of Agriculture.
The plan has also been updated recently in consultation with Stakeholder Ministries/Departments.
The Agriculture Minister has also requested all Chief Ministers, vide his letter dated 12.05.2015, to direct the officers concerned to expedite preparation of State level Management Plans on Drought.
11. SDRF/NDRF funds: First Instalment of SDRF released: The State Government is primarily responsible for providing necessary relief in the wake of natural calamities.
Government of India supplements the efforts of state Governments with financial assistance.
For undertaking relief measures, funds are available with State Governments in the form of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).
The first instalment of SDRF has already been released to State Governments.

I welcome you all to World Food India 2017.
This event will provide you a glimpse of the opportunities that await you, in India.
It will showcase our potential in the food processing value chain.
It will provide a platform to connect with various stakeholders, and collaborate for mutual prosperity.
And, it will present to you, some of our most delightful cuisine, which has stimulated taste buds across the world.
We are second, globally, in terms of production of rice, wheat, fish, fruits and vegetables.
Our horticulture sector has shown an average growth rate of 5.5 per cent annually over the last ten years.
For centuries, India has welcomed traders from distant lands, who came in search of our distinctive spices.
Their travels to India, often shaped the course of history.
Even Christopher Columbus was attracted to Indian spices, and reached America, as he searched for an alternate sea route to India.
It has been practiced for ages, even in the humblest of households.
Simple, home-based techniques, such as fermentation, have resulted in the creation of our famous pickles, papads, chutneys and murabbas that now excite both the elite and the masses, across the world.
India was ranked number one in the world in 2016 in greenfield investment.
Archaic laws have been repealed, and the burden of compliances has been reduced.
It is a priority sector in our “Make in India” programme.
100% FDI, is now permitted, for trading, including through e-commerce, of food products manufactured or produced in India.
There are attractive fiscal incentives from the Union and State Governments.
Loans to food and agro-based processing units, and cold chains, are classified under priority sector lending, making them easier and cheaper to obtain.
It maps resources upto the local level, with processing requirements.
Many international companies in India have taken a lead in contract farming initiatives.
This is a clear opportunity for global super-market chains considering India as a major outsourcing hub.
Each one of them, is a potential customer for the food processing industry.
India can provide solutions, and offer a win-win partnership.
The combination of traditional Indian food, with modern technology, processing and packaging, can help the world rediscover the health benefits, and refreshing taste of Indian food ingredients such as turmeric, ginger, and tulsi, to name just a few.
The perfect blend of hygienic, nutritious and tasty processed food, with the added benefits of preventive healthcare, can be produced economically, here in India.
Recently, we launched a national level programme, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana, to create world-class food processing infrastructure.
The creation of Mega Food Parks is a key component of this scheme.
This will offer immense value proposition in crops such as potato, pineapple, oranges and apples.
We plan to link our villages through broadband connectivity, within a clear timeframe.
We are digitising land records, and providing various services to the people on mobile platforms.
These steps are building momentum towards real-time transfer of information, knowledge and skills to farmers.
The e-NAM, our national agricultural e-Market, is connecting our agricultural markets nationwide, thereby giving our farmers the benefit of competitive pricing, and freedom of choice.
Many States have come up with attractive food processing policies to attract investment.
I urge each State of India to identify at least one food product for specialisation.
It offers several valuable by-products, such as bee wax.
It has the potential to increase farm incomes.
Our commitment to sustainable development, is at the heart of our thrust for organic farming.
Sikkim, in north-eastern India, has become India’s first fully organic state.
To give you just one example, milk based products and fruit-juice based drinks are an intrinsic part of Indian food habits.
That is why, I have been suggesting to manufacturers of aerated drinks, the potential of blending five per cent fruit juice in their products.
Food processing also holds solutions to nutrition security.
For example, our coarse grains and millets have high nutritional value.
Can we take up a venture based on these?
This will raise incomes of some of the poorest of our farmers, and also enhance our nutrition levels.
Such products, shall, of course, find resonance across the world.
Can we link our potential, to the world’s requirements?
Can we link Indian traditions with the future of mankind?
Can we connect India’s farmers with markets around the world?
It will also provide valuable insights into our rich culinary landscape, and highlight our ancient wisdom of food processing.
I invite each one of you to become a part of the exciting growth journey of India’s food processing sector.
I assure you of my whole-hearted support, whenever required.
For India, and for the world.

And what is further heartening is the fact that this was PSLV’s 38th successive successful launch.
This important matter has not been discussed much, but it has drawn Shobha Ji’s attention.
And those gifted with extra-ordinary intelligence do not let inquisitiveness to remain just that; they begin further questioning it, look around for newer queries, and try to create new realms in the spirit of enquiry.
If we try to take a bird’s eye view of thousands of years of the onward march of human life and progress, we can easily say that this great journey has no point of culmination.
It is a simple mobile App.
But it is so powerful that when a fisherman goes to sea for fishing, this App is able to provide guidance for direction to locate the most productive fishing zones and also provide multifarious types of information such as the direction and speed of the wind, the height of waves and so on.
This whole array of information is available on this mobile App which can be utilised by our fishermen brethren for moving to those areas with maximum fish presence in a very short time and thus earning their livelihood.
I urge my countrymen, especially the youth of our country and those who have won prizes under ‘Lucky Grahak Yojana’ or ‘Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana’ to become ambassadors of these schemes on their own.
Also teach them about the procedure of making transactions through this App; teach this specially to small traders in your neighbourhood.
This decomposed waste can be safely handled quite conveniently and can be used as ‘NPK’ which is a very useful fertilizer.
‘Beti Bachao – Beti Padhao’ movement is moving forward with rapid strides.

The conference on the theme of “Mines to Market 2017”, brings together miners, diamond companies, experts, retailers, bankers and analysts from across the globe.
This is one of India’s success stories.
From just twenty eight million dollars in 1966-67, exports reached one billion dollars in 1982-83 and two billion dollars in 1987-88.
This reduced the efficiency of the supply chain.
Many of you wanted us to enable viewing and trading to happen in India.
In December, 2014 at the World Diamond Conference held in Delhi, I had announced in the presence of the Russian President that we would set up a Special Notified Zone to achieve this.
This promise has been kept.
Amendments have been made to our laws to enable rough diamonds to enter and exit, duty free for the purpose of viewing.
Many of the most reputed international names in the diamond industry have conducted over two hundred and forty four days of viewings.
My intention is to make India, which is already the cutting and polishing hub, into an International Diamond Trading Hub.
Ladies and Gentlemen, our goal is to transform India in one generation.
Since taking office, this government has placed emphasis on many transformative initiatives.
‘Make in India’ is one of them.
Our aim is to make India a preferred destination for manufacturing.
In the last fifty years, the gems and jewellery sector has accounted for four hundred and seventy five billion dollars of exports.
This is despite the fact that India has little diamond or gold production.
Another important initiative is Skill India.
India cherishes its excellent relations with Africa.
Our shared post-colonial heritage and the similarity of the challenges we face, make us natural partners.
I take this opportunity to assure my friends from Africa that India will be happy to support them in developing their gems and jewellery sector, and in training their technicians.
I began by saying that this sector has come a long way from where it was.
However it is still far behind where it should be.
Our strongest area is diamond cutting and polishing.
In terms of the global value in the gems and jewellery market, our share is lower than it should be.
Our future is much bigger than cutting and polishing alone.
I am told that to a significant extent, Indian exports are importer-led: the specifications and designs are based on preferences given by importers.
This means that India is a follower of global fashion rather than a leader of global taste.
Let me give an example.
India has many famous icons, sculptures and statues dating back over two thousand years.
Many of them are shown wearing jewellery.
These works of art have captivated people from around the world.
Have we documented these?
Have we thought of promoting jewellery based on these works of art?
We live in an era where cloth retailers change people’s preferences.
Can’t our jewellers, with their skills, strengths and heritage, create and change global tastes and fashions?
In order to be able to influence and change global fashion, our industry first needs to have a thorough knowledge of its market.
Today, India has acquired a global brand for high skills and excellence in software.
We are yet to do that in jewellery.
If we do that, the potential is huge.
This is a task which the Council should take up in right earnest.
But the states also have a role to play.
Since taking office, we have encouraged state governments to take an active role in export promotion.
Apart from exports, India as the fastest growing economy in the world will also see increased domestic demand.
It is important for the industry to plan its growth.
But that is not enough.
A bank deposit of approximately five thousand rupees would earn enough interest to pay these premia permanently.
India will celebrate the seventy fifth anniversary of its Independence in 2022.
What can you do for the country by then?
If changes are needed in regulations, I ask you to come up, with specific and practical suggestions.
I conclude by thanking you for this opportunity to share my thoughts.
The Project will be completed in five years.
The residential areas along thisMetro Rail corridorsshall be immensely benefitted by this project, as the people of these areas will be able to travel on trains from their own neighborhoods to reach different areas of the city conveniently.
This will fulfil the long term demand of ‘Parivara’ and Talawara’ communities for granting Scheduled Tribes status in the State of Karnataka.

Pranaam Amma
Respected Dignitaries on the Dais
On this pious and sacred occasion, I offer my deep regards to Amma.
I also pray to the Almighty to give long life and good health to her.
She is the guiding light for millions of devotees.
Not only that, she has become the synonym of life for many devotees.
Like a real Maa, she nurtures her devotees through direct and indirect acts; visible and invisible hands.
I am very fortunate to be among those who have been receiving Amma’s blessings and unconditional love.
Three years ago, I had the opportunity to be present at Amritapuri, to pay my respects on the occasion of Amma’s 60th birthday celebrations.
India is the land of such saints who have seen God in everything that can be seen.
Mankind is prominent among those things.
That is why service to mankind has become their main motto.
I am aware that even in her childhood Amma was fond of giving her own food to others.
Serving the old and the aged, and helping the needy have been her childhood passions.
Also, she used to worship Lord Krishna in her childhood.
These two qualities have been her strength.
Devotion to God and Dedication to the Poor is thus, the message which I have personally taken from my association with Amma.
Millions of devotees from all over the world also believe in the same.
I am aware of the social and charitable works done by various institutions and programmes run by Amma.
She is always keen to help the world’s poor in meeting their five basic needs: food, shelter, health care, education, and livelihood.
I would like to particularly mention the works done and donations made in the field of sanitation, water, housing, education and health.
I understand that some of those beneficiaries will get their certificates today.
Particularly, Amma’s initiative on building toilets has been a great help in our Swachh Bharat Programme.
Amma has pledged to contribute one hundred crore rupees towards sanitation efforts in Kerala.
This pledge includes the construction of fifteen thousand toilets for the poor.
Today, I am informed that throughout the State, Amma’s ashram has already completed construction of two thousand toilets.
I know that this is just one example of various works being done in the fields of environmental conservation and sustainability.
One year ago, Amma generously donated one hundred crore rupees to the Namami Gange programme.
I am also aware of Amma’s helping hands to mitigate the sufferings in the aftermath of natural disasters.
It is also heartening to note that the Researchers at Amrita University are innovating new approaches to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems.
At the end, I would like to convey my sincere thanks for giving me the opportunity of joining the celebrations.

The Union Cabinet under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the proposal for Amendment to the Resolutions dated 3rd March 1987 of the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB).
The proposed amendments are as under:
(a) selection of candidates from State Public Enterprises and Private Sector as non-internal candidates for a period of five years for appointment in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs);
(b) holding of office by the Chairperson and Members of the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) for a period of 3 years from assumption of charge or until attaining the age of 65 years or until further orders whichever is earlier;
To broadbase the catchment for senior positions in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), the policy of allowing candidates from State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and Private Sector has been in place.
This is proposed to be further extended for another five years with other requisite changes for effective discharge of Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) functions.
The amendment will continue to provide a wider pool of professionals for selection by impact allowing the candidates from State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and private Sector to be considered for senior positions in the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).
Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) would also benefit by the skill-sets and domain expertise of those coming from the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) as well the private sector.
It would also ensure that the Central PSE senior management gets the benefit of the perspective gained both within and outside.

Q1- What’s your ideal holiday destination?
Thank you for asking this question.
Infact, this question brings back a lot of memories.
Every place has been special, it brings a new experience to be cherished.
Q2- Which book changed your life?
There are many aspects of life.
Merely one aspect changing cannot transform lives.
The journey of life is a process of evolution, more than being revolutionary in nature.
In our culture, we are taught to imbibe the best thoughts from all sides, to learn from a very wide range of texts, scriptures, from respected seers, saints and other knowledgeable men and women.
I am fortunate to have experienced that, hearing diverse thoughts and ideas from people.
I am also an avid reader.
A task completed in time and in its entirety – there is nothing that gives me greater relaxation.
This meant I had to learn cooking and subsequently it became a habit.
By nature, I like to do a thing well, and I tried the same while attempting to cook!
Q5- What would you say are your main qualities?
Even today, I am trying to discover myself and I keep discovering myself through the help of my friends and well-wishers.
Q6- Do you have any hobbies?
I also like to spend time reflecting in solitude.
Q7- What’s your favourite place in India?
The Himalayas.
Q8- Which politician do you admire the most?
For his efforts to unify and integrate India, I deeply admire Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I admire people like Bhagat Singh for their valour, sacrifice and martyrdom for the nation, that too at a remarkably young age.
Mahatma Gandhi for igniting the consciousness of the masses and integrating them in the struggle for freedom.
There are several other great men and women whose lives have left a deep impact on my mind.
We must learn from them in our quest to make this world a better place.
Q9- What is your earliest memory?
I have memories of growing up in a small town in my home state at a time when my country had just attained Independence.
I do not belong to a very wealthy family so one does remember the hardships one faced while growing up.
Among other things I remember the time when I would sell tea at my father’s tea stall at the local railway station.
I recall the time when I served tea to the soldiers in transit when our country was fighting a war.
Another memory is when my friends and I set up a food stall and donated the proceeds for flood relief to those affected by a local flood.
Q10 What would your super power be?
Should I ponder about super power or the Supreme Power?!
I believe we are all under the benign gaze of the Supreme One.
Q11- What is the most important lesson life has taught you?
From my hardships, a heart that works and hands that deliver.
Q12- What is your greatest fear?
The journey of my life has been such that fear doesn’t have much space in my life.
But, I do always have it at the back of my mind that I should not become a burden for anybody till my very last breath.
I dread that prospect (of becoming a burden on anybody.)
By nature I do not get angry.
It is not in my style to do that.
But yes, as I said earlier I do not like it when a person does not give it his or her best.
I also do not like it when people have double standards.
It is very important to be what one is.
Q14- What did you dream of becoming when you were growing up?
However, I wasn’t sure about the path forward to realize my inner urgings.
I used to go along whatever path fate nudged me on at any given time.
One thing, however, that remained constant was to live life in the service of others.
Q15- What’s your favourite film?
I am generally not inclined towards movies.
But I used to watch them in my youth, out of that curiosity which only youth brings.
Even then, it was never my temperament to watch movies just for entertainment.
Instead, it was in my habit to search for lessons for life in the stories those movies told.
And, after the movie, I got into an intense debate with my friends.
My argument was that the central idea in the movie was that, ultimately, everyone gets guided by his or her inner soul.
But since I was too young, my friends did not take me seriously!
Q16- In the film of your life, who would you choose to play you?
Every life has its own philosophy.
Why should we have an urge that people should remember me after I am gone?
If at all they have to remember, it should be our work, our contribution in the service of others.
And, if your life work has been worthy, anybody who can carry it forward would be playing the role of my life as well as the role of his life!
Q17- If you could go back in time, where would you go?
It is a very old question.
My instinctive reaction will be to see that the fire does spread to anything in the vicinity.
If I am able to do that, a lot would get saved automatically.
Q19- If you could invite three people, dead or alive, to dinner, who would they be?
By nature, I am a person given to fasting for spiritual purposes.
These are highly elevated souls who do not need a dinner!
Q20: Your favourite quote?

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi delivered the following inaugural address at PETROTECH 2019 in Noida.
At the outset, I apologise for the delay due to logistical reasons.
I am delighted to welcome you all to PETROTECH-2019, the thirteenth edition of India’s flagship hydrocarbon Conference.
I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Dr. Sultan Al Jaber for his contribution to the energy sector and vision for the future.
Over the last quarter century, PETROTECH has served as a platform to discuss solutions to challenges that we face in the energy sector.
In each of our respective countries, we seek to deliver affordable, efficient, clean and assured energy supplies to our citizens.
The presence of over sixty countries and seven thousand delegates here, is a reflection of that common quest.
Several decades of public life have convinced me that energy is a key driver of socio-economic growth.
Suitably priced, stable and sustainable energy supply, is essential for rapid growth of the economy.
It also helps the poor and deprived sections of society, to partake of economic benefits.
At the macro level, the energy sector is a pivot and key enabler of growth.
As we gather here to discuss the present and future of global energy, winds of change are evident in the global energy arena.
Energy supply, energy sources and energy consumption patterns are changing.
Perhaps, this could be a historic transition.
There is a shift in energy consumption from West to East.
The United States has become the world’s largest oil and gas producer after the shale revolution.
Solar energy and other renewable sources of energy have become more competitive.
They are emerging as sustainable substitutes for traditional energy forms.
Natural Gas is fast becoming one of the largest fuels in the global energy mix.
There are signs of convergence, between cheaper renewable energy, technologies, and digital applications.
This may expedite the achievement of many sustainable development goals.
Nations are coming together to tackle climate change.
This is visible in global partnerships, such as the International Solar Alliance, promoted by India and France.
We are entering an era of greater energy availability.
Many more do not have access to clean cooking fuel.
India has taken a lead in addressing these issues of energy access.
In our success, I see hope for the world that problems of energy availability can be suitably addressed.
People must have universal access to clean, affordable, sustainable and equitable supply of energy.
India’s contribution in the onset of an era based on energy justice is significant.
Currently, India is the fastest growing large economy in the world.
Leading agencies such as IMF and World Bank, project the same trend to continue in the coming years.
We are also the third largest energy consumer in the world, with demand growing at more than five percent annually.
India remains an attractive market for energy companies with energy demand expected to more than double by 2040.
We have adopted an integrated approach towards energy planning.
During the last PETROTECH Conference in December 2016, I mentioned four pillars for India’s energy future.
These are energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security.
Energy justice is also a key objective for me, and a top priority for India.
Towards this end, we have developed and implemented many policies.
Electricity has reached all our rural areas.
This year we aim to achieve hundred per cent electrification of households in India, through a targeted programme called SAUBHAGYA.
As we raise production, we also aim to reduce losses in transmission and distribution.
Under our UDAY scheme, we are working towards this objective.
India’s World Bank Ease of Getting Electricity Ranking, improved from one hundred and eleven in 2014 to twenty-nine in 2018.
LPG connections have been given to over sixty four million or 6.4 crore households in just under three years under the Ujjwala Scheme.
A ‘Blue Flame Revolution’ is underway.
LPG coverage has reached more than ninety percent, from fifty-five percent five years ago.
Clean Transportation is getting a boost.
We are jumping directly from BS four to BS six fuel by April 2020.
This is the equivalent of EURO six standards.
Achievements such as hundred percent electrification, and increased LPG coverage, are possible only through people’s involvement.
Energy justice can be done only when people believe in their collective power.
Government is only an enabler in converting that belief into a reality.
The bidding criterion has been changed to revenue sharing.
This has helped reduce government intervention.
An Open Acreage Licensing Policy and a National Data Repository is helping to increase exploration interest in Indian fields.
Gas pricing reforms have also been introduced.
The Enhanced Oil Recovery Policy aims to promote the use of latest technology in improving productivity of upstream fields.
Our downstream sector has been completely liberalized.
Market driven petrol and diesel prices reflect changes in the international price of crude oil.
India has the fourth largest refining capacity in the world.
This will further grow by about 200 million metric tons by 2030.
A National Biofuel Policy was enacted last year.
Research on second and third generation biofuels is being promoted.
Twelve second generation bio-refineries are being set up in eleven states.
The ethanol blending and biodiesel programme is reducing carbon emissions, and raising farmers’ incomes.
Bio Aviation Turbine Fuel has already been tried out in our civil aviation sector.
Our government has encouraged private participation across the entire oil and gas value chain.
India is becoming an attractive FDI destination.
Companies like Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, TOTAL, Exxon-Mobil, BP and Shell are looking to increase their investments across the value chain.
India is making rapid strides towards a gas based economy.
This will connect North East India with the National Gas Grid.
The tenth bid round for City Gas Distribution will be complete in a month’s time.
This will cover over four hundred districts.
It will extend coverage of City Gas Distribution to seventy percent of our population.
We are gearing up for Industry 4.0.
This will change the way industry operates, with new technology and processes.
Our companies are adopting latest technologies to improve efficiency, increase safety and reduce costs.
This is being done in downstream retail, as well as in upstream oil and gas production, asset maintenance and remote monitoring.
We have been able to convert our traditional buyer-seller engagements into strategic partnerships through bilateral investments.
We have also promoted our ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy by strengthening energy engagement with Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Myanmar.
I have regularly engaged with global CEOs from the oil and gas sector.
In my interactions with world leaders and CEOs, I have always maintained that Oil and Gas are not only a commodity of trade but also of necessity.
Whether it is for the kitchen of a common man or for an aircraft, energy is essential.
For too long, the world has seen crude prices on a roller-coaster.
We need to move to responsible pricing, which balances the interests of both the producer and consumer.
Only then can we serve the energy needs of humanity in an optimal manner.
Another key issue that needs the world to come together is climate change.
Together, we can achieve the targets we set for ourselves at COP-21 in Paris.
India has made rapid strides in meeting its commitment.
We are on our way to reaching the target.
PETROTECH provides the perfect setting to ponder over the future of the energy sector.
It is a good platform to reflect on how global shifts, transitions, policies and new technologies will influence market stability and future investments in the sector.
I wish you all a successful and fruitful Conference.

I am sure, it shall be of mutual benefit to investors, innovators, think-tanks and other stakeholders from across the world.
I would have liked to be there in person.
I am happy, however, that the power of IT enables me to address you remotely.
To all the delegates joining us from abroad: Welcome to India.
Welcome to Hyderabad.
On the side-lines of this conference, I hope you shall have some time to explore the vibrant history, and delectable cuisine of Hyderabad.
I am sure, it shall encourage you to visit other parts of India as well.
The concept of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam– the world is one family”, is deeply imbibed in Indian philosophy.
It reflects our inclusive traditions.
IN the twenty-first century, technology is becoming an enabler or this concept.
It helps us create a seam-less, integrated world.
A world where geographical distance no longer remains a barrier in collaborating for a better future.
Today, India is the hot-spot of digital innovation, across all sectors.
India is best placed to leverage the power of technology and leap-frog into the future while ensuring empowerment of every citizen.
Leveraging technology in such a holistic manner was unthinkable some years ago.
We have successfully completed this life-cycle in the last 3 and a half years.
This has been possible through a change in public behavior and processes.
Digital India has not remained merely a Government initiative, but has become a way of life.
Technology has transcended power-point presentations and has become an inseparable part of people’s lives.
Around 22 million digital hospital transactions across 172 hospitals in India are bringing comfort in the lives of patients.
The National Scholarship Portal for easy Scholarships today has 14 million students registered on it.
The unique Umang app launched only three months back is already offering 185 Government services.
Today 2.8 lakh Common Services Centers are there in different parts of the country giving many digital services to people.
Government e-Market-place has been developed as the National Procurement Portal of India.
It enables small and medium enterprises to compete in meeting the procurement requirements of the Government.
This simple IT framework has improved transparency in Government procurement.
Yesterday, at Mumbai University, I had the opportunity to dedicate to the nation, the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
This is an independent, non-profit research institute, with a mission of Artificial Intelligence for Social Good.
They are helping to secure a better, more comfortable future for humanity.
We stand today, at the cusp of the fourth Industrial Revolution.
It is in this context, that I place the World Conference on Information Technology, in India today.
The key themes at this Conference, reflect the opportunities that await us.
I am told, NASSCOM has identified eight important technologies.
NASSCOM has also identified fifty-five job roles that are going to be in high demand globally.
I am sure, the “skills of future” platform will greatly help India maintain its competitive edge.
Digital technology is now at the heart of every business.
New technologies must be embedded in various operations and processes of a business entity.
How can we prepare our millions of small and medium businesses for this transformation, in a short time?
Keeping in mind the importance of innovation, in the future of economy and business, the Government of India has launched the Start-up India initiative.
We believe our startups are the key to finding viable and economical solutions across sectors and verticals.
Under the Atal Innovation Mission, we are building Atal Tinkering Labs in schools across India.
The objective of this scheme is to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds.
I am sure, that as you deliberate on various themes of Information Technology, you shall keep the interests of the common man at the back of your mind.
I once again welcome the distinguished delegates from across the world, to India.
May your deliberations be productive?
May the outcomes benefit the poor and the under-privileged across the world?
My dear countrymen, my greetings (namaskar) to you all
Last year, we had to endure so many trials – the scorching heat of the summer, scarcity of water, drought conditions and so on.
Going by the predictions of the scientists, this time there should be good rainfall, far and wide and throughout the rainy season.
This news in itself charges us with a lot of enthusiasm.
I extend my greetings to all our farmer brethren hoping for a bountiful rainfall.
In our country, like the toiling farmers, our scientists are also achieving success on many fronts to take our country to new heights.
I have believed it right from the beginning that the new generation should nurture the dream of becoming scientists, should have keen interest in Science, and our youngsters should step forward with the zeal to do something for the coming generations.
I also want to share another bright news with you.
For the past many years, several students have made their contributions to this project.
In a way, this academic satellite is a living example of the soaring flight of courage and ambition of the young India.
That has led these our students to make this satellite.
All these students deserve hearty congratulations.
Along with America, the satellites of many other countries were launched on Indian soil by Indian scientists and along with these, those two satellites made by our students also reached outer space.
Still, some incidents infuse a new life into this slogan.
You get goose pimples just at the mention of ‘women fighter pilots’; we feel so proud that these three Flying Officer daughters of ours- Avni Chaturvedi, Bhawna Kanth and Mohana, have achieved this great feat.
You must have noticed that all these three daughters do not hail from metro cities of India.
They do not even come from the capital cities of their respective states.
Despite hailing from small cities and towns, they nurtured dreams as high as the sky, and they also made them come true.
I extend my heartiest wishes to these three daughters Avni, Bhawana and Mohana as well as their parents.
My dear Countrymen, a few days ago on 21st June, the whole world organised grand shows in observance of the anniversary of the International Day for Yoga.
As an Indian, when we witness the entire world coming together through Yoga, we realize that the entire world is getting linked with our past, present and future.
We are forging a unique bond with the rest of the world.
In India too, the International Yoga Day was celebrated at over 1 lakh places, with a lot of fervour and enthusiasm in myriad forms and hues, and in an atmosphere of gaiety.
I also got an opportunity to perform Yoga in Chandigarh amidst thousands of Yoga lovers.
It was worth watching the zeal of the young and old alike.
You must have seen that last week the Indian government issued a postage stamp on ‘Surya Namaskar’ on the occasion of International Yoga Day.
This time, people all over the world, on Yoga Day, were witness to two special events.
Yoga by itself means adding – getting connected.
Yoga has the power to connect the entire world.
But for that to happen, first all of us need to get connected to Yoga.
Swati Srivastava from Satna in Madhya Pradesh, called me up on telephone after the Yoga Day and left a message for all of you but it seems that it pertains more to me: –
Sound Byte: “I wish that my entire country should be healthy and all the poor people also should remain free from diseases.
For this I want that among the many ads that are played on Doordarshan, there should be one ad on Yoga, how it is to be done, and what are its benefits?”
And I have seen that there are some countries in the world which have T.V. channels exclusively dedicated to Yoga 24 hours a day.
And you probably know that, during the month of June, in view of the International Yoga Day, I used to share a video everyday of one particular asana of Yoga through Twitter and Face Book.
If you go to the website of the Ministry of Ayush, you will see available there a 40-45 minutes very good video demonstrating one after another, different kinds of yog asanas for different parts of the body that you can do, people of all ages can do.
When we say that Yoga is a way to rid oneself of illnesses, then why don’t we bring together all the different schools of thought of Yoga, which have their own methods, their own priorities and their own experiences.
All the rights of the citizens were suspended.
The country was turned into a prison.
Lakhs of people along with Jai Prakash Narain, thousands of leaders, many organisations were put behind bars.
Many books have been written on that dark period.
My endeavour has always been to ensure that the nation moves forward on the strength of people’s participation.
Recently, when my government completed two years of functioning, some young people of modern thinking suggested, “When you talk such big things about democracy, then why don’t you get your government rated by the people also.”
In a way it had a tone of challenge as well as advice.
But that stirred my mind.
We should give it a try and see what happens.
Lakhs of you displayed your interest in this but 3 lakh people devoted their time and put in serious effort for giving an answer to each and every question.
Thus, my primary impression is that there has been a large and active participation of people connected to rural India and poverty issues.
This I liked the most.
There was a time when taxes were so pervasive, that it became a habit to avoid taxation.
There was a time when there were many restrictions imposed on bringing foreign goods into the country which gave rise to a lot of smuggling.
Today I want to impress upon you that we end up losing our peace of mind by trying to escape from rules and regulations.
As a result, anybody can trouble and harass us.
Why should we let this happen?
Not once will it be asked as to from where all this wealth came and how it was acquired.
And so, this is a good chance for you to become a part of a transparent system.
My dear countrymen, I had to talk about this in Mann Ki Baat today because recently I held a two-day conclave with the Revenue Departments- all the officials of the Income Tax, Customs and Excise Departments.
And I have told them in clear words that we should not perceive citizens as crooks.
If they want to follow rules, we should encourage them, and lovingly help them cross over.
And when I was taking inputs from them in this conclave, I gathered information which I want to share with you as well.
None of you will believe that in a country of 125 crore people, one and a half, only one and a half lakh people exist, whose taxable income is more than 50 lakh rupees.
Nobody will be able to swallow something like this.
People having a taxable income of more than 50 lakh rupees can be seen in big cities in large numbers.
And in another way, this is the way out to save yourself from any trouble that could arise after 30th September.
My dear countrymen, the common man of this country is always looking for a chance to do something for the country.
When I asked the people to give up their cooking gas subsidy, more than 1 crore families of this country voluntarily gave up their subsidy.
Do you know what the reason is?
And not just this, he sent me 52 cheques, post dated, which bear a date for each forthcoming month.
We certainly do not have any right to evade tax in this country where there is one such government employee, who after retirement, out of a pension of mere sixteen thousand rupees, gives five thousand for the Cleanliness Campaign.
No one could be a greater source of inspiration than Chandrakant Kulkarni.
And for the people who are associated with the Cleanliness Campaign also, there could be no better inspiring example than Chandrakant Kulkarni.
I express my felicitations and admiration for the Kulkarni family, I congratulate them.
And surely there must be countless people like them about whom I have no information.
These are the very people… and this is the power and strength of the masses.
A man with a pension of sixteen thousand rupees sends me cheques worth two lakhs, sixty thousand in advance, is this a small thing?
Come, let us search deep down inside our hearts, and ponder over the fact that the government has given us an opportunity to disclose our incomes.
While thinking of Chandrkant Kulkarni, let us also follow him.
My dear countrymen, Santosh Negi from Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, has called up to relate one of his experiences.
He has given a message regarding water conservation.
Friends, his experience can be of use to you as well: –
Sound Byte: “Drawing inspiration from you, in our school, before the onset of monsoon we dug 250 small trenches which were 4 feet deep, along the side of the playground, so that rainwater could be collected in these.
This way the play ground remained unspoilt and there was no danger of children drowning in these… and we managed to save crores of litres of rainwater which fell on the playfield.”
Santoshji, I would like to thank you for sending me this message.
How can we retain the rainwater of the villages there itself and similarly preserve rainwater of cities therein.
To recharge Mother Earth once again, how can we replenish water back to the earth?
An atmosphere has certainly been created in the country.
Lately, in all the states a lot of measures have been taken for water conservation.
But now that we are going to have the bounty of rain water, we must see to it that it doesn’t just flow away.
We are so concerned about saving lives; we should be equally concerned about saving water.
This 1922 is one such number that if you give a missed call to it, you can listen to Mann Ki Baat in the language of your choice.
By listening to Mann Ki Baat, at the time of your convenience, in the language of your choice, you too can make up your mind and resolve to contribute to the journey of the nation’s progress.
From regions in conflict to the streets of distant cities, terrorism extracts a deadly price.
Old structures of terrorism remain.
There are countries that still use it as an instrument of state policy.
But, we also see the changing character of terrorism: global links, franchise relations, home-grown terrorism and use of cyber space for recruitment and propaganda.
There is a new level of threat to pluralist and open societies.
We don’t have a comprehensive global strategy to combat terrorism.
And, we tend to be selective in using the instruments that we have.
Even more important than what we face is how we respond to the threat.
There should be no distinction between terrorist groups or discrimination between states.
We have to help each other secure our cyber space, and minimize use of internet and social media for terrorist activities.
It is equally important to promote broader peace and stability in West Asia and Africa.
This is also required for addressing the current refugee crisis.
Today, there are an estimated 60 million people in need of protection worldwide.
The West Asian crisis has focused global attention on this acute humanitarian challenge.

It is a day of enormous significance for you here in Sri Lanka, for us in India, and for Buddhists around the world.
And, I am most grateful to Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, Excellency Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the people of Sri Lanka for extending to me the honourto be the Chief Guest at the International Vesak Day festivitiesin Colombo.
On this auspicious occasion, I also bring with me the greetings of 1.25 billion people from the land of the Samyaksambuddha,the perfectly self awakened one.
Excellencies, and Friends,
Our region is blessed to have given to the world the invaluable gift of Buddha and his teachings.
Mahindra and Sanghamitra, the worthy children of King Ashokamade their journey from India to Sri Lankaas धम्मा दूत to spread the biggest gift of धम्मा.
And, as Buddha had himself said:सब्ब्दानामधम्मादानं जनाती, meaning, the gift of धम्मा is the biggest gift of all.
Today, Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important nerve centres of Buddhist teachings and learning.
The friendship between India and Sri Lanka was etched in time by the “Great Master”.
Buddhism imparts an ever present radiance to our relationship.
It draws its strength as much through our interconnected values of Buddhism as it does from the limitless possibilities of our shared future.
Ours is a friendship that lives in the hearts of our peopleand in the fabric of our societies.
To honour and deepen our links of Buddhist heritage, I have the great pleasure to announce that from August this year,Air India will operate direct flights between Colombo and Varanasi.
Venerable Monks, Excellencies and Friends,
India’s rapid growthcan bring dividends for the entire region, especially in Sri Lanka.
Today,India’s development cooperation with Sri Lankaamounts toUS Dollars 2.6 billion.
Because, the economic and social well being of the people of Sri Lankais linked with that of 1.25 billion Indians.
My conversations with President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have only reinforced our will to join hands in achieving our common goals.
The मध्यम प्रतिपदा , the Middle Path shown by Buddha, speaks to all of us.
Its universality and evergreen nature is striking.
The themes of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace,chosen for the Vesak day,resonate deeply with Buddha’s teachings.
The themes may appear independent.
But, they are both deeply interdependentand interconnected.
The issue of Social justiceis linked to conflictwithin and among communities.
This arises principally because of तन्हा or (तृष्णा in Sanskrit), the thirst, which in turn stems from greed .
Our desire to achieve all our wants has created income inequalities in communities and disturbed social harmony.
Similarly, the biggest challenge to Sustainable World Peace today may not be necessarily from conflict between the nation states.
It is from the mindsets,thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence.
The menace of terrorism in our region is a concrete manifestation of this destructive emotion.
And, not just a negative notion of peace defined by the absence of conflict.
But, a positive peace where we all work to promote dialogue, harmony and justice, based on compassion and wisdom.
As Buddha said,”नत्तीसंतिपरणसुखं”, “there is no higher bliss than peace”.
This is the true path to free individuals, families, societies, nations and the world at large from the three poisons of greed, hatred and ignorance.
I look forward to paying homage at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, in Kandy today afternoon.
May the Triple Gem of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha bless us all.

Your Excellency Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
It is a great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on his first ever visit to India.
Your visit, Prime Minister, is a long-anticipated moment in the journey of friendship between India and Israel.
Your visit is also a fitting climax to the comemoration of 25 years of diplomatic relations between India and Israel.
As our first honoured guest in 2018, your visit marks a special beginning to our New Year calendar.
It comes at an especially auspicious time as people all over India are rejoicing the arrival of spring, renewal, hope and harvest.
The festivals of Lohri, Bihu, MakarSankranti, and Pongal celebrate the splendour of India’s diversity and unity.
Last year in July, I carried the greetings and friendship of 1.25 billion Indians during my momentous journey to Israel.
Our discussions were wide-ranging and intensive.
They were marked by the desire to do more.
Prime Minister, I have a reputation of being impatient in getting results.
If I may let out an open secret, I know that so are you.
Last year in Tel Aviv, you had expressed the intent to cut down bureaucratic red tape with a machete and forge ahead with speed.
Prime Minister, I am happy to tell you that in India, we are well on our way to doing just that.
We have imparted our shared impatience to the implemntation of our earlier decisions.
The results are already visible on the ground.
Our discussions today were marked by convergence to accelerate our engagement and to scale up our partnership.
We will pursue this in three ways:

Government approval no longer required for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT)
It has now been decided to permit 100% FDI under automatic route for SBRT.

Civil Aviation
As per the extant policy, foreign airlines are allowed to invest under Government approval route in the capital of Indian companies operating scheduled and non-scheduled air transport services, up to the limit of 49% of their paid-up capital.
It has now been decided to do away with this restriction and allow foreign airlines to invest up to 49% under approval route in Air India subject to the conditions that:

Cases under the government approval route, also requiring security clearance with respect to countries of concern, will continue to be processed by concerned Administrative Department/Ministry.
FDI policy on Pharmaceuticals sector inter-alia provides that definition of medical device as contained in the FDI Policy would be subject to amendment in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

Yunmo Sung, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy,
Distinguished Business Leaders,
A very good afternoon.
I am delighted to meet you all today in Seoul.
This is my third interaction with the Korean business leaders in the span of just 12 months.
This intensity is intentional.
I wish to see more and more Korean businesses turning their attention to India.
Even when I was the Chief Minister of the state of Gujarat, I traveled to Korea.
Korea was, and still remains, a role-model of economic growth for me.
India today, a country of 1.25 billion people, is going through a great transition.
It is changing from:
· An agriculture dominated economy to an economy led by industry and services;
· An economy that is closed to one that is globally inter-linked;
· An economy that is known for its red tape, to one known for its red carpet.
India has emerged as a land of opportunities.
While we work for realizing the ‘Indian Dream’, we seek like-minded partners.
And, among them, we see South Korea is truly natural partner.
The negotiations to upgrade Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement have been fast-tracked to achieve the bilateral trade target of 50 billion Dollars by 2030.
Not just trade, in investment terms also we are seeing a positive turn.
And, Korean investments into India have reached a cumulative figure of almost 6 billion Dollars.
After my visit to Korea in 2015, we launched a Korea specific facilitation cell “Korea Plus” under ‘Invest India’ to guide, assist and handhold investors during the entire life-cycle of the business.
Hyundai, Samsung, LG electronics have become trustworthy brands in India.
And, Kia is soon to join this club.
Over 600 Korean companies have invested in India.
And, we aspire to welcome many more.
And, to ease your path, Visa on Arrival for Korean nationals has been put in place since October last year.
We encourage the presence of Korean Trade Offices in India.
And, I am glad that we recently had the sixth office of KOTRA opened in Ahmedabad.
Let me tell you a little more about what is happening in India now.
The fundamentals of our economy are sound.
We are well set to become a 5 trillion dollar economy in the near future.
Hard policy decisions such as the introduction of Goods and Services Tax have been taken.
In the last four years, we have jumped 65 places in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking, to 77th.
And, we are determined to move into the top 50 next year.
We are one of the most open countries for Foreign Direct Investment today.
More than 90 percent of our sectors are now on automatic route for approval.
As a result of this and the confidence in India, we have received FDI worth over 250 billion Dollars over the past four years.
In India, we are also focused on making our growth inclusive.
It is for this reason that we have taken strong initiatives for financial inclusion.
In the course of the past three years, we have opened over 300 million bank accounts for those who never had a bank account.
They now have access to affordable pensions and insurance.
Under the Mudra scheme, we have extended micro credit worth more than 90 billion dollars to 128 million persons over the past three years.
74 percent of these loans have gone to women.
We have leveraged the power of a biometric identity system, bank accounts and mobile phones, to deliver subsidies and services to the previously unbanked.
Government benefits worth more than 50 billion Dollars are now transferred directly to the beneficiaries, thus eliminating leakages.
We have taken huge strides in rural electrification.
India is now recognised by the International Energy Agency as one of the greatest success stories in bringing about rural access to energy in 2018.
In renewable energy, we have become the sixth largest producer in the world.
This, and our initiative of the International Solar Alliance, will enable India to be a pioneer in moving towards a green Global economy.
That is our commitment to a green and sustainable future.
Through these steps, the way of life of our people in all corners of the country is being transformed.
This, in turn, is transforming governance and public service.
Economic progress is closely tied to world-class infrastructure.
Be it Transport, Power, Ports, Shipbuilding, Housing and Urban Infrastructure, there is huge demand in India while there are strong technological capabilities and capacities in Korea.
We estimate the investment requirements in Infrastructure at over 700 billion Dollars by 2022.
Under the Sagarmala Project, Port projects involving Investment of over 10 billion Dollars have been identified for award in the upcoming five years.
For example in Automobile sector, The National electric mobility mission aims for affordable and efficient Electric Vehicles.
South Korea being a leading manufacturer of Electric Vehicles has a huge opportunity in this sector in India.
Research and innovation would be the driving force in 4th industrial revolution era.
And, we do understand that the role of government is to provide the support system.
In this regard, we have introduced flagship program Start-up India with 1.4 billion Dollars fund for four years to create a startup ecosystem in India.
This synergy in policy regimes is a reflection of areas of common interest for both India and Korea.
Our vision of an India-Korea Startup Centre – will provide a hub for Korean startups and Indian talent to freely communicate.
South Korean National IT Industry promotion Agency has already opened their Indian office in Bengaluru to facilitate Korean startups to India.
It is our earnest desire to work with Republic of Korea more closely to realize the dream of our citizens.
The Prime Minister said that as maritime neighbours, there is a vast scope for cooperation between India and Indonesia on development of Blue Economy as well as in the domain of maritime security.
Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, India
Secretary General, International Energy Forum
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Welcome to India.
Welcome to the 16thInternational Energy Forum Ministerial Meeting.
As you come together today to discuss the future of global energy,the world is seeing a great transition in energy supply and consumption.
• Consumption growth has shifted to non OECD countries: Middle East, Africa and developing Asia;
• The US may soon become the largest producer of oil.It is predicted to meet a major portion of the additional oil demand in the next few decades;
• Coal may gradually go out of favour as a major contributor to primary energy in the OECD World and later in developing countries;
Let me share with you some of my thoughtson the hydrocarbon sector and our endeavourto achieve energy security.
Oil and Gas are a commodity of tradebut also of necessity.
Whether it is for the kitchen of a common manor for an aircraft,energy is essential.
We need to move to responsible pricing,which balances the interests of both the producer and consumer.
Efforts at artificially distorting prices are self-defeating,as history has shown us.
As a responsible global member of the comity of nations,India is committed to combating climate change,curbing emissions and ensuring a sustainable future.The launch of the International Solar Allianceis a step towards fulfilling this commitment.
Our Down-stream sectorhas been completely liberalizedwith market driven petrol and diesel pricesreflecting the changes in price of crude oil.
Our Government believesin an integrated approach to energy planning.
And,our energy agenda in Indiais inclusive,market based,and climate-sensitive.
Universal access to modern energy by 2030;
Urgent action to tackle climate change – in line with the Paris agreement;
Measures to improve air quality;
We believe access to clean cooking fuelis very important to improve standards of living.
Women benefit the most from it.
In fact, here in New Delhi,we have already started offering BS Six standard fuel this month.
Our oil companies are assessing all their investmentskeeping in view the energy diversification strategies.
These are all pertinentsubjects for the future of our collective energy security.
I wish you all a successful and fruitful Ministerial Conference.

This policy also provides for marketing freedom for crude oil and natural gas produced from these blocks.
This is in tune with Government’s policy of “Minimum Government –Maximum Governance”

The prices of sugar are being monitored by the Department of Food & Public Distribution regularly at factory gate as well as in the domestic market.
In order to regulate supply of sugar and address issue of speculative prices, fixing of appropriate stock limit on need basis was essential.
In addition, despite adequate availability of stocks for consumption in the current season, hoarding and consequent profiteering is anticipated due to drop in production over previous year and hence further extension of stock limit would be needed.
Also a performance based production subsidy has been extended @Rs.4.50 per quintal of cane crushed which was directly credited to the farmers account on behalf of sugar mills.
In order to maintain domestic prices at reasonable levels, the Government has allowed import of a restricted quantity of 5 lakh MT of raw sugar at zero duty by millers/refiners having their own refining capacity.
This restricted quantity will help the sugar industry to augment their liquidity and enable them to pay cane dues of farmers.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
We in India believe in researching both the frontiers of science and technology, as also, researching deep within our souls, that is, both Science, and Yoga.
Perhaps, there can be no better place than Rishikesh, to host the International Yoga Festival.
This, indeed, is a place that has drawn sages, pilgrims, commoners and celebrities alike, over millennia, in quest for peace, and for the true essence of Yoga.
And in most cases, that quest, has led them, to Yoga.
It expands our limited sense of self, to see our families, societies and mankind, as extensions of our own self.
Oneness with our families, with the society we live in, with fellow humans, with all the birds, animals and trees with whom we share our beautiful planet…this is Yoga.
Yoga is the journey from ‘me’ to ‘we.’
It would be very unfair to see Yoga only as a set of exercises that keeps the body fit.
Yoga offers a timeless, simple, and healthy alternative.
There is ample evidence that practicing yoga helps combat stress and chronic lifestyle-related conditions.
When we talk of global peace, there should be peace among nations.
That is possible only when there is peace within the society.
Only peaceful families can constitute peaceful society.
Only peaceful individuals can make peaceful families.
Yoga is the way to create such a harmony and peace within individuals, family, society, nation and ultimately all over the world.
When we talk of combating climate change, we seek to move away from a lifestyle of consumption, or “Bhoga”, to one of Yoga.
Therefore, instead of attainment, Yoga shows us the path to liberation, or Mukti, as we call it in this part of the world.
Swami Chidanand Saraswati ji, through his work at Parmarth Niketan has shown a way to live these noble ideals.
I appreciate the work being done by Parmarth Niketan in bringing Yoga to people across the world.
I recall the active role played by Swami ji, in compiling the 11 volume Encyclopaedia of Hinduism.
Remarkably, Swamiji and his team have accomplished this mission in less than a quarter of a century.
And the depth of their work is amazing.
This increased under-standing, in turn, reduces hatred, misunderstanding and increases cooperation, peace and amity among communities.
Let me also take this opportunity, to compliment Parmarth Niketan, for the active role played by them in the Swachh Bharat Mission – a mass movement towards Clean India.
Indian traditions lay a strong emphasis on personal hygiene.
Not only is keeping one’s body clean and pure emphasized, but also cleanliness in one’s house, place of work and place of worship is given a lot of priority.
This is not true for western and other developed countries, where the link between community hygiene and public health is more clearly understood.
Awareness and observance of hygiene of public goods like water bodies, land and air is crucial.
Through the Swachh Bharat Mission, we are attempting to establish the link between community hygiene and personal health.
In the first phase, we have taken Kamakhya Temple, Jagannath Puri, Meenakshi Temple, Tirupati, Golden Temple, and Vaishno Devi temple for making them and their surroundings clean.
And now, every year, on the occasion of Summer Solstice – June 21 – the world comes together, for Yoga.
Yoga has the potential to herald in a new Yuga (a new era) – a Yuga of peace, compassion, brotherhood and all-round progress of the human race.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
May you find fulfilment and bliss, in this great festival of Yoga, on the banks of the River Ganga, where our sages and rishis have meditated for millennia.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved setting up of six new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in Andhra Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Goa, Jammu, Kerala and Karnataka.
The Cabinet further gave its approval for operationalisation of these IITs initially by forming of Societies under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 in order to give a legal status to them till the amendment for their incorporation in The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 is enacted.
Each new IIT will have an initial intake of 180 students in its first year from temporary / transit which would increase to 450 in the second year and to 928 (840 Undergraduates, 80 Postgraduates and 8 Ph.D.) in the third year of their operation.
The total cost for running these IITs is Rs. 1,411.80 crore and will be incurred between 2015-16 and 2018-19.
The new IITs will be operated from their temporary campuses for the initial period of three years before shifting into their permanent campuses in the 4th year.
Each IIT will have a sanctioned strength of faculty members, with a faculty-student ratio of 1:10.
The present approval for the establishment of the six new IITs to be registered as Societies under the Societies under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 to create new legal IIT entities, as passing the Bill for amendment of the IT Act, 1961 for incorporation of the six new IITs in the Parliament will take some time.
The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, contains no provision to enable establishment of new IITs.
Every new IIT commenced since its enactment has required an amendment to the Act itself.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to carry out official amendments in “The National Waterways Bill, 2015”.
The amendments are based on the recommendations of the Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture and comments of State Governments.
It provides for enacting a Central Legislation to declare 106 additional inland waterways, as the National waterways.
The following changes have been effected in the original list of 101 waterways that was introduced with the National Waterways Bill 2015, on 05.05.2015:-
In order to carry out these changes, an official amendment to the National Waterways Bill, 2015 will have to be moved in the Lok Sabha in the current Session of Parliament.
Declaration of the above additional 106 waterways as National Waterways would not have any immediate financial implications.
Financial approval of the competent authority for each waterway would, however, be taken based on the outcome of the techno-economic feasibility studies etc. that are being undertaken by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) currently.
IWAI will develop the feasible stretch of National Waterways for shipping and navigation purpose through mobilization of financial resources.
The declaration of these National Waterways would enable IWAI to develop the feasible stretches for Shipping and Navigation.
The right over the use of water, river bed and the appurtenant land will remain with the State Government.
In addition, other benefits to States are: fewer accidents, less congestion on roads, cheaper mode of ferrying passengers, reduced logistics costs in cargo movement and development of adjoining areas.
The expeditious declaration of National Waterways and its subsequent development will enhance the industrial growth and tourism potential of the hinterland along the waterway.
This will also provide an additional, cheaper and environment friendly mode of transportation throughout the country.
Inland Water Transport is considered as the most cost effective and economical mode of transport from the point of view of fuel efficiency.
Further in a study as highlighted by the World Bank, 1 litre of fuel can move 105 ton-Km by inland water transport, whereas the same amount of fuel can move only 85 ton-Km by rail and 24 ton-Km by road.
My heartfelt thanks to Finance Minister Sri Arun Jaitley ji for this budget.
Our focus is on the villages, poor, farmers, women and the youth.
The budget has plans for ambitious schemes to bring in a qualitative change in their lives.
This budget presents a comprehensive , time bound action plan for poverty alleviation.
Several measures have been outlined to double the income of the farmers.
Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana is one of them where a substantial allocation has been made to ensure water to every farm.
All of us know the importance of power and road infrastructure .
There is a vision in this budget to connect every village to road by 2019.
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana has been allocated substantial funds to connect the rural India by roads.
Besides there is a clear plan to provide electricity to every village by 2018.
Owning a house is his biggest dream.
Everyone from a middle class or neo middle class wants to own a house.
How are we going to help them realize this dream?
This is not possible without the help of the government.
That’s why provisions have been made this time to give impetus to the housing sector and ensure a house to general household.
People who are living in rented house have also got increased rebate in Income Tax over House Rent.
Those who are earning up to 5 lakhs will have to pay lesser tax.
There has been a lot of politics over the poor.
You will be amazed to know that if a poor lady who cooks food for her children using a Chulha faces adverse impact on her and her children’s health.
Experts say that the smoke of that chulha , is equivalent to the smoke of 400 cigarettes per day.
We have to help people below the poverty line and that’s why we have decided to provide free gas connection to such people.
5 crore families who use chulha for cooking will get freedom from smoke.
Poor will get health benefits and environment will protected as well.
Our government is also taking important decisions in health sector.
At times, an ailment can destroy life of a poor family or a middle class family or a neo middle class family.
We have presented schemes for senior citizens who are in dire need of help.
This budget has made provisions for boosting defence manufacturing and providing the armed forces with modern and potent equipment.
You might have seen that in infrastructure a provision of more than 2 lakh crore Rupees has been made.
This will benefit our forces who are guarding our borders.
The youth of the country is moving ahead.
In order to provide him employment opportunities we are going to come out with two new initiatives, ‘formalizing the informal’ and ‘employing the unemployed.’
My Mantra is Start Up India, Stand Up India.
To provide a favorable ecosystem for startups, the budget has provided plans in the taxes.
Our Dalit and Tribal youth now wants to become an entrepreneur.
He doesn’t want to be Job Seeker anymore but a Job Creator.
In order to make him realize his dream, the government has decided to establish an entrepreneurial hub.
These institutes will be provided financial aid as well.
This is a great initiative in educations sector.
Once there will be an environment of competition among higher education institutes, you can imagine what impact will it bring.
Primary education is equally important.
And this budget presents priorities to such qualitative issues.
Traders and professionals who are facing such problems should be made free from it.
A common man who earns livelihood will be free from processes involving presumptive tax payment on turn over.
The Scheme is intended to facilitate at least two such projects per bank branch, on an average one for eachcategory of entrepreneur.
It is expected to benefit atleast 2.5 lakh borrowers.
The expected date of reaching the target of at least 2.5 lakh approvals is 36 months from the launch of the Scheme.
The Stand Up India Scheme provides for:
• Refinance window through Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) with an initial amount of Rs. 10,000 crore.
• Creation of a credit guarantee mechanism through the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company (NCGTC).
• Handholding support for borrowers both at the pre loan stage and during operations.
This would include increasing their familiarity with factoring services, registration with online platforms and e-market places as well as sessions on best practices and problem solving.
The details of the scheme are as follows:
• Focus is on handholding support for both SC/ST and Women borrowers.
• The overall intent of the approval is to leverage the institutional credit structure to reach out to these under-served sectors of the population by facilitating bank loans repayable up to 7 years and between Rs. 10 lakh to Rs. 100 lakh for greenfield enterprises in the non farm sector set up by such SC, ST and Women borrowers.
The “Start up India Stand up India” initiative was announced by the PrimeMinister in his address to the nation on 15th August, 2015.
President Hollande, Excellencies,
The pain of Paris is yet to heal.
So, I speak in admiration for your resilience and resolve.
And, I salute the world for standing, in full strength, with France and Paris.
Over the next few days, we will decide the fate of this planet.
We do so when the consequences of the industrial age powered by fossil fuel are evident, especially on the lives of the poor.
The prosperous still have a strong carbon footprint.
And, the world’s billions at the bottom of the development ladder are seeking space to grow.
So, the choices are not easy.
But, we have awareness and technology.
We need now national will and a genuine global partnership.
We are determined to do so, guided by our ancient belief that people and planet are inseparable; that human well being and Nature are indivisible.
So, we have set ambitious targets.
We will achieve it by expanding renewable energy – for, example, by adding 175 Gigawatts of renewable generation by 2022.
We will enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2.5 billion tonnes worth of carbon dioxide.
We are reducing dependence on fossil fuel through levies and reduction in subsidies; switching sources of fuel where possible; and, transforming cities and public transportation.
We hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely.
It is not just a question of historical responsibility.
They also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact.
And, climate justice demands that, with the little carbon space we still have, developing countries should have enough scope to grow.
This also means aggressive mitigation action by developed countries before 2020, including ratification of 2nd Commitment period of Kyoto Protocol, removing conditions and revisiting targets.
The principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities must remain the bedrock of our collective enterprise across all areas – mitigation, adaptation and means for implementation.
Anything else would be morally wrong; and disparities.
Equity means that national commitments must be consistent with the carbon space nations occupy.
We also need a strong Agreement on Adaptation and Loss and Damage.
Developed countries must fulfill their responsibility to make clean energy available, affordable and accessible to all in the developing world.
This is in our collective interest.
So, we look to the developed countries to mobilize 100 billion US Dollars annually by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in the developing countries.
They must fulfill their commitment in a credible, transparent and meaningful manner.
Energy is a basic human need.
So, we need an ambitious technology initiative, driven by a public purpose, not just market incentives.
For this, we need to scale up Green Climate Fund that will improve access to technology and intellectual property.
We still need conventional energy.
We should make it clean, not impose an end to its use.
And, there should be no place for unilateral steps that become economic barriers for others.
We welcome stocktaking that is transparent, covers both support and commitments, and based on differentiation.
Ultimately, for success, moderating our lifestyle is necessary, and possible, for a low carbon future.
The presence of 196 countries tells us that we have a chance to unite behind a common purpose.
We will succeed if we have the wisdom and courage to craft a genuinely collective partnership that balances responsibilities and capabilities with aspirations and needs.

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval to the US $ 1,500 million project of World Bank Support to Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [(SBM(G)].
The Project basically provides for incentivising States on the basis of their performance in the existing SBM-G.
Incentivisation of States was approved by the Cabinet while approving the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) on 24th September, 2014.
The current approval provides for the mechanism of such incentivisation through World Bank credit.
The States will pass on a substantial portion (more than 95 percent) of the Performance Incentive Grant Funds received from the MOWS, to the appropriate implementing levels of districts, Blocks, GPs etc.
The project will also put in place a robust and credible independent verification system for annual measurement of improvement in rural sanitation.
The project will support the SBM(G) programme in achievement of its objectives of attaining open defecation- free and clean environment.
Since poor sanitation is related to ill-health, malnutrition, poor education and poverty; achievement of SBM(G) objectives will have a beneficial effect on all of these.
It will therefore ensure a better quality of life for the rural population.
In other words, a Performance- based Incentive Grant Scheme, as part of SBM (G), is proposed to be launched through World Bank support credit funds.
The project comes in the background of acceleration of efforts under Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) which has a goal to accelerate efforts to achieve universal sanitation coverage, improve cleanliness and eliminate open defecation in rural India by 2019.
The program is considered India’s biggest drive to improve sanitation and cleanliness in the country.

Let’s give a big hand to our outstanding young exhibitors today.
And, I know that many of you think that the only problems that have not been solved are the ones for which you have not written the apps yet.
The course of human history and progress has been shaped by imagination, inspiration, invention and innovation.
The idea of Start Ups is as ancient as this world.
Each economic age has been defined by disruption of the previous one, by the evolution of ideas and products that displace the old ones.
Start Ups have always been the engine of progress.
The mega corporations of today were Startsup of yesterday.
What is different now is that the digital age has created a fertile new environment for Startups.
Today, the Startups defy the natural rates of growth.
An idea can become a global name within a year.
Customers can multiply at the rate of millions, employees at the rate of thousands and valuation at the rate of billions.
That underlines America’s success and inspires the world.
When each of the five hundred odd towns produces ten Startups and each of our six hundred thousand villages produce six small businesses, on a regular basis, we will create an enormous economic momentum and generate a huge number of jobs in our country.
It is driven by the energy, enterprise and innovation of our youth.
We now have the institutions, incentives and interest for new ventures.
We have incubators, accelerators and investors willing to back an idea and assume risks.
India has woken up to the potential of Startup Ventures with great enthusiasm and energy.
In the past few years, they have grown exponentially.
We have here an outstanding group of Startups from India.
They are applying technology to transform healthcare, education, agriculture, clean energy, security, financial inclusion of the poor and access to clean water.
Our Startups represent not just commercial success stories, but are powerful examples of social innovation.
The pace at which people in India are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income.
There are nearly a billion people with cell phones in India; smart phones and internet users are in hundred millions, growing at high double digits.
The scale of India’s development needs is huge.
And, the need to achieve it is urgent.
We cannot simply continue on the traditional paths to development.
This is the vision and the spirit behind Digital India, which I spoke about last night: to use technology to transform governance, empower our citizens, eliminate barriers to opportunities, deepen social change, impart scale and speed to development, improve delivery of services, design affordable products for the poor, customize services for specific groups,and build a more sustainable future for our planet.
Startups will have an important role in achieving our vision.
From creating infrastructure to providing services, from manufacture of products to human resource development, from supporting governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy, Digital India is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you.
I see Startups, not as short term investments, but as long term commitments.
Our application and enterprise is limited only by our imagination.
We have here today our Department of Space that provides free data on its portal.
In the course of past few months, we have put together 170 applications of space technology in governance and development.
Many of these could become the vehicles of new ventures in India.
But, it is not just about the opportunities generated on the digital platform and advanced science by urban enterprises.
I want to see the idea and the spirit of Startups light up the economies and the fortunes of people in rural India.
From handicrafts to tourism, the frontiers of possibilities and the scale of reach in India is immense.
I want this especially for our rural women, who have shown marvelous success in enterprise, whenever they have had opportunity.
They transform not only our rural economy, but also our society.
Our development models speak of Public Sector and Private Sector.
I speak of a third sector, Personal Sector, of individual enterprises, micro enterprises and micro finances.
That is why I focused on Startup India in the Independence Day Address this year.
We are launching schemes that will support our mission.
And, I assure you that they won’t trap your creativity in long government procedures.
One is the Atal Innovation Mission, after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji to promote innovation.
Another is SETU, which means bridge in Hindi – Self Employment & Talent Utilisation (SETU).
This will be an incubation and facilitation programme.
We are also setting up Electronics Development Fund to support design, development and launch of new products.
We are reforming our regulations and processes, and making it easier to start and do business in India.
We are making our digital infrastructure and services accessible and affordable that will also bring broadband to six hundred thousand villages, and free Wi Fi to schools, universities and public places.
We are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security, intellectual property rights and cyber security.
So, Make in India, Skill India and Design India will create a surge of opportunities.
For, India and the United States have a natural partnership of innovation and technology that has shaped the knowledge economy.
I am told thatIndians account for 15% of startups here.
Hundreds of thousands of Indian professionals here and in India are contributing to the global success of U.S. enterprises.
Many are leading them today.
Our universities, labs and firms are working together for next generation advanced bio fuels, solar energy and energy efficiency.
Young Stanford scholars are teaming up with Indian counterparts in Delhi to make affordable biomedical devices for rural India.
MIT Tata Centre’s Khethworks is changing the lives of small farmers with solar-based irrigation systems.
We have here with us Manu Prakash, a young Indian scientist in Stanford, who has a lab to his name at the university.
This is the power of our cooperation and collaboration.
Sitting here, you can touch the life of a young child in a remote village.
I also hope that a young girl in a small town in India will look at the exhibitors today and dream of her own project.
And, someone in Mumbai or the Bay Area will be the angel to her dreams.
This is the possibility of the digital bridge – to connect distant lives and change fortunes and future.
This is the potential of youth and innovation.
It can ignite a partnership between India and the United States, which can advance prosperity in our two countries and give new content to our strategic partnership.
It can enable us to lead in the digital century and find solutions to enduring human problems and emerging global challenges.
I am delighted to see so many new partnerships formed today.
I want to than TiE for its valued suggestions for creating a more supportive environment for Startups.
I know you will succeed on the strength of your genius and enterprise.
But, when you need a helping hand, or when you find hurdles in your way, we will be there for you.

Your Excellency Dr Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Your Excellency Salahuddin Rabbani, Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, My colleague Minister Arun Jaitley ji, Foreign Ministers, Heads of Delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is an honour to speak at the inaugural session of the 6th Ministerial Conference of the Heart of Asia- Istanbul Process on Afghanistan.
I thank Excellency Ghani for accepting my invitation and for gracing this conference.
Its streets and parks tell stories of great valour and immense sacrifice.
It is a city whose character has been shaped by proud patriotism and generous philanthropy of its residents.
And, by their spirit of enterprise, creativity and hard work.
Amritsar also happens to nurture an old and steadfast connection of warmth and affection with Afghanistan.
Among the earliest disciples of the first Guru of Sikhs, Baba Guru Nanak Dev ji, were Afghans he had preached to in Kabul in the 15th century.
Even today, the shrine of an Afghan-origin sufi saint Baba Hazrat Sheikh in Punjab is revered by all faiths, including visitors from Afghanistan.
The flow of trade, people and ideas through our region has often intersected in Amritsar on one of Asia’s oldest and longest surface arteries, the Grand Trunk Road.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Since the turn of this century, the international community has extensively engaged in Afghanistan.
Major powers, regional countries and concerned nations from around the world have cooperated through multiple programmes of political, social, military, economic, and developmental support.
Our gathering today re-affirms the commitment of the international community to durable peace and lasting political stability in Afghanistan.
Our words and actions remain focused at advancing a critical unfinished mission of our time.
And, that is to help Afghanistan:
*Build and strengthen its social, political and institutional fabric;
*Secure its territory and citizens from external threats,
*Spur its economic and development activity,
*and Stitch a stable and prosperous future for its people.
We have no doubt about the scale of the challenge.
But, we are equally determined to succeed.
The results of our collective efforts thus far have been hard-won, but mixed.
There have been important successes.
Much more remains to be done.
The need of the hour is to stand our ground and continue with our line of effort.
We must protect and build on the gains of the last fifteen years and march ahead.
Because, at stake is not just the future of Afghanistan that has invested in a vision of development, democracy, and pluralism.
But, the peace and stability of this entire region, and beyond.
Let us also reflect with urgency on what more must be done and what we must avoid in Afghanistan so that its citizens can self-sustain peace and economic growth.
The answers are all there.
The question is of resolve and action.
And, of putting Afghanistan and its people first.
For this, First, an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled process is key.
It is the only guarantor of durability of solutions.
Second, we must demonstrate strong collective will to defeat terror networks that cause bloodshed and spread fear.
Terrorism and externally induced instability pose the gravest threat to Afghanistan’s peace, stability and prosperity.
And, the growing arc of terrorist violence endangers our entire region.
As such, support for voices of peace in Afghanistan alone is not enough.
It must be backed by resolute action.
Not just against forces of terrorism, but also against those who support, shelter, train and finance them.
Silence and inaction against terrorism in Afghanistan and our region will only embolden terrorists and their masters.
Third, our bilateral and regional commitments of material assistance for Afghanistan’s development and humanitarian needs must continue and increase.
Our cooperative endeavours in Afghanistan should contribute to its infrastructure and institutional capacity, and self-propelling engines of growth.
Fourth,we should all work to build stronger positive connectivity between Afghanistan and other countries of the region.
Afghanistan should be at the centre of our connectivity networks, not peripheral to them.
On our part, we see Afghanistan as the hub for strengthening links of connectivity between South Asia and Central Asia.
We cannot deny that the more connected Afghanistan is with the regional arteries of trade, capital and markets, the more assured would be its economic growth and progress.
President Ghani and I have converged on the priority of strengthening trade and transport linkages with other partners in the region.
On India’s part, our commitment to our brave Afghan brothers and sisters is absolute and unwavering.
The welfare of Afghanistan and its people is close to our hearts and minds.
The successful record of our partnership in projects, big and small, in Afghanistan speaks for itself.
The principal dimension of our cooperation has always been its people centric nature.
Our joint efforts:
*educate Afghanistan’s young and nurture their skills;
*provide health care and improve agriculture;
*build infrastructure and institutions; and
*allow traders and small businesses in Afghanistan to connect with immense commercial and economic opportunities in India.
And, the reach and benefit of such efforts extends to all corners of Afghanistan.
Herat’s India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam, also called the Salma Dam, that was launched a few months ago, will help revive economic activity for the people there.
The Parliament Building in Kabul represents our strong commitment to Afghanistan’s democratic future.
Zeranj-Deleram highway and India-Afghanistan-Iran cooperation on Chahbahar would enable Afghanistan to link its economy with centres of strong economic growth in South Asia and beyond.
We also plan to connect Afghanistan with India through an air transport corridor
President Ghani and I have discussed additional measures for deepening our bilateral cooperation.
We are making progress in developing plans for utilization of the additional 1 billion US Dollar earmarked by India for capacity and capability building in Afghanistan.
It will extend to areas like water management, health, infrastructure, energy and skill development.
As India implements its additional commitments, we are open to work with other like-minded partners for the development of Afghanistan.
We are also happy to note the international commitments at the Brussels Conference in October and NATO’s Warsaw Summit in July this year.
We will continue efforts to scale up our ambition and dedication to assist Afghanistan.
In this, we draw upon lessons learned and best practices derived from our shared experience in working on projects.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen
Let us remember that every passing day we help Afghanistan to achieve successful political, security and economic transitions, we are also helping ourselves create a more peaceful region and world.
I hope that your deliberations will produce constructive and forward looking pathways for action that:
*promote cooperation in place of conflict,
*development in place of need, and security in place of terrorism.
Let us re-dedicate ourselves to making Afghanistan a Geography of Peace.
A place where reason and peace succeeds; progress and prosperity prevails and democracy and plurality wins.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved MoU between India and Bangladesh for fairway development of Ashuganj-Zakiganj stretch of Kushiyara river and Sirajganj-Daikhawa stretch of Jamuna river in the Indo-Bangladesh protocol route by undertaking necessary dredging jointly by the two countries.
The MoU will considerably reduce the logistics cost of cargo movement to North Eastern India.
It will also reduce the congestion through the Siliguri Chicken’s Neck corridor.
This will benefit about 50 lakh Government employees and 58 lakh pensioners.
The availability of power and water through the project upon its successful completion will lead to the overall economic development of the western region of Afghanistan and generate goodwill for India in Afghanistan.
The completion of this project will address the energy requirements and irrigation needs of western Afghanistan.
The foreign exchange rate variation between Indian rupee and US dollar, increase in consultancy charges due to extended period of project completion, escalation, training of Afghan personnel etc. have necessitated revision in the project cost.
It also has a provision for releasing water for irrigation of 75,000 hectares of land.

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for introduction of steps for promotion of payments through cards and digital means.
The move aims at reducing cash transactions.
Several short term (to be implemented within one year) and medium term measures (to be implemented within two years) have been approved for implementation by the Government Ministries/ Departments/ Organisations.
Promotion of payments through cards and digital means will be instrumental in reducing tax avoidance, migration of Government payments and collections to cashless mode, discourage transactions in cash by providing access to financial payment services to the citizens to conduct transactions through card/ digital means and shifting payment ecosystem from cash dominated to non-cash/less cash payments.
The essential features of the proposals for promotion of payments through cards and digital means include steps for withdrawal of surcharge/service charge/ convenience fee on card/ digital payments currently imposed by various Government Departments/organisations and introduction of appropriate acceptance infrastructure in Government Departments/ organisations; rationalization of Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on card transactions and a differentiated MDR framework for some key transaction segments; mandating payments beyond a prescribed threshold only in card/ digital mode; introduction of formulae linked acceptance infrastructure by the stakeholders of certain card products; rationalisation of telecom service charges for digital financial transactions; promotion of mobile banking; and creation of necessary assurance mechanisms for quick resolution of fraudulent transactions and review the payments ecosystem in the country.
The infrastructure of card/ digital payments is growing, but remains modest in comparison to cash payments.
For card/ digital payments to increase, they should be easy to use, readily available and accepted, should not impose any undue financial burden on the merchant and user, and should offer an appropriate level of security.
Current experience and evidence indicates that the penetration and success of modern card/ digital payment products and services is concentrated to a large extent in the tier-l and tier-ll locations of the country and mostly to those citizens who have access to the formal banking channels.

To prepare communities to cope with disasters, it emphasizes on a greater need for Information, Education and Communication activities.

Monsoon Session: Respect for the time, resources and dignity of the Parliament
• Monsoon Session of the parliament gets underway tomorrow.
The need of the hour is to ensure that we make maximum use of the time in this session.
Barring a few exceptions, there has been a considerable increase in parliament productivity over the past three years.
My thanks to all the political parties for this.
• The budget session was convened was convened about a month ago.
All political parties extended their co-operation.
• A major impact of advancing the budgetary process by a month has been that the funds allotted to several departments for various schemes reached before the monsoon season.
Earlier, it used to take two to three months for the funds allocated to the schemes to reach up to the departments.
The implementation was delayed due to the monsoon.
It has also provided three months additional time for the completion of infrastructure projects.
• According to the estimates from Controller General of Accounts, the expenditure in April-June this year has been 30% more than the same time previous year.
• The trend of expenditure in the schemes reflects that the funds allocated would be spent in a balanced manner throughout the year.
Earlier, the expenditure used to begin after the monsoon and unnecessary pressure was there to spend the money before March.
It was one of the reasons for the faults in the system.
Floods in North Eastern States
• Incessant rains in many parts of the country and the floods in the north eastern states has been a cause of concern.
Many Central Government agencies are engaged in flood rescue and relief operations.
State Governments have been told to inform urgently whenever they need any assistance.
Tough on terrorism
• Entire nation has been in a state of shock in the wake of the attack on Amarnath pilgrims by the terrorists.
The Government will ensure that the perpetrators of this attack are brought to book.
• We are fully committed to maintain peace in Jammu and Kashmir and to wipe out the anti national elements from the state.
The Government is trading the path laid down by Atal ji.
• Some anti social elements have incited violence in the name of cow protection.
Those engaged in disturbing the harmony in the country are trying to take advantage of the situation.
• It has an impact on the image of the nation.
State Governments must deal sternly against such anti-social elements.
Public sentiments are attached with the cow.
However, people must know that there is a law to protect the cow and the violation of law is not an alternative.
The State Governments must also see to it that in the name of cow protection some people are settling their personal rivalry.
• All the political parties should condemn strongly this goondaism in the name of cow protection.
• Over the past few decades, the image of political leadership has been at crossroads due to the deeds of some of the leaders amongst us.
We need to convince the people that every leader is not tainted and every leader is not only running after money.
• What is required that we have to be transparent in our public life and yet there should be action against corrupt leaders.
• 75th anniversary of uit India Movement falls on 9th August .
Parliament should discuss it.
• It would have been better had the Presidential election been held by consensus.
However, it is a matter of satisfaction and pride that the election campaign has been a dignified one.
All the political parties need to be congratulated.
He asked, “Do you have pictures of your own Northeast visits or glimpses of the spectacular natural beauty of the region?”
I warmly welcome you all to India and to Delhi.
I hope you will have time to see some of them.
Madam Lagarde, this event is another example of your fondness for India and Asia.
I congratulate you on being appointed as Managing Director for a second term.
The quotas of emerging countries will now better reflect their weight in the world economy.
This will give them more say in collective decisions in the IMF.
You have demonstrated exceptional leadership, in managing the tensions that emerged due to the delay.
You played a major role in finally persuading all members to ratify the decisions taken in 2010.
It must reflect changes in the global economy, and the rising share of emerging economies.
Even now, IMF quotas do not reflect the global economic realities.
Change in quotas is not an issue of increasing the ‘power’ of certain countries.
It is an issue of fairness and legitimacy.
I am, therefore, very happy that the IMF has decided to finalize the next round of quota changes by October 2017.
India has always had great faith in multi-lateralism.
Our ties, therefore, are more than seventy years old.
We are a Founding Member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank.
We are confident that these banks will play an important role in the development of Asia.
The Fund has built up an immense stock of economic expertise.
All its members should take advantage of this.
All of us need to pursue policies that provide a stable macro economy, enhance growth and further inclusion.
The Fund can be of great assistance in this.
Apart from advice, the IMF can help in building capacity for policy making.
I am happy to announce a new partnership with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India and the IMF.
We have agreed to set up the South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Centre.
The centre will provide training to government and public sector employees.
It will enhance their skills and improve the quality of their policy inputs.
It will also provide technical assistance to governments and public institutions.
Let me now turn to the theme of this conference.
Many knowledgeable people have said that the twenty first century is, and will be, the Asian Century.
Three out of every five people in the world live in Asia.
Its share in global output and trade is now close to one-third.
Its share in global foreign direct investment is about forty percent.
It has also been one of the world’s most dynamic regions.
Although Asia has slowed down, it is still growing at a rate three times greater than that of the advanced countries.
It is, therefore, the ray of hope for global economic recovery.
When we think about Asia, we must recognize that it is distinct in many ways.
For example, the theme of this conference is ‘Investing for the Future’.
Asian Families tend naturally to save more than people in other parts of the world.
Thus they invest for the future.
Economists have commented on the savings ethic of Asian countries.
Asians tend to save to buy a house, rather than borrow to buy a house.
Many Asian countries have relied more on developmental financial institutions and banks than on capital markets.
This provides an alternative model for the financial sector.
Social stability built on strong family values is another feature of Asia’s development.
Madam Lagarde, you are one of the world’s top women leaders.
Asia has done so to a much greater degree than other continents.
Today, four large states of India – West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan – are headed by democratically elected women.
The Speaker of the Lower House of Parliament in India is also a woman.
India has a special place in Asia.
It has historically contributed to Asia in several ways.
Buddhism spread to China, Japan, and other parts of South East Asia from India.
It has had a lasting influence on the continent’s culture.
Kingdoms in the South and West of India have engaged in maritime trade with other parts of Asia for over a thousand years.
The Indian national movement showed other Asian countries that freedom from colonial rule could be achieved without violence.
It also demonstrated clearly that the sense of nationhood, could be broad and inclusive.
It need not be defined by narrow linguistic or religious identities.
The Sanskrit saying “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – the world is one family – refers to this sense of the oneness of all identities.
India has dispelled the myth that democracy and rapid economic growth cannot go together.
India’s growth rate of over seven per cent is being achieved in a country that is also a vibrant democracy.
It is sometimes assumed that democracy is a colonial gift to India.
But historians tell us that India had produced forms of democratic self governance, many centuries ago, when democracy was unknown in many parts of the world.
India has also shown that a large, diverse country can be managed in a way that can promote economic growth and maintain social stability.
One way in which we are doing this is through cooperative and competitive federalism.
The states and the Centre come together to pursue common objectives.
States which pursue good policies and deliver essential services for the poor, induce others to follow.
Our rapid economic growth is also very distinct in Asia.
We have never tried to gain in trade at the expense of our partners.
We do not follow “beggar thy neighbour” macro-economic policies.
We have never undervalued our exchange rate.
We add to world and Asian demand by running current account deficits.
We are therefore good Asian and good global economic citizens, and a source of demand to our trading partners.
We all want Asia to succeed.
I firmly believe that India can contribute to Asian prosperity and development by being economically strong.
Madam Lagarde, you have referred to India as the “bright spot” in the global economy.
I view this as a great privilege and, at the same time, a major responsibility.
Let me outline our achievements in the last few months and our priorities for the period ahead.
We have achieved major gains in macro-economic stability.
A durable reduction in inflation, steady fiscal consolidation, a comfortable balance of payments position and build-up of foreign exchange reserves are the highlights.
We have improved our economic governance.
Thanks to our financial inclusion programme, we now have the world’s largest and most successful programme of direct benefit transfers, in cooking gas.
We plan to extend it to other sectors such as food, kerosene, and fertilizers.
This has improved targeting and the quality of public expenditure.
We have opened up nearly all sectors of our economy to FDI.
India achieved the highest ever rank in the World Bank Doing Business indicators in 2015.
India reached an all-time high in many physical indicators in 2015, including
I am very happy to note that all our colleagues have expressed one voice and one sentiment.
Today, when we talk of Jammu & Kashmir, we should talk about four parts of the State of Jammu & Kashmir: Jammu, Kashmir Valley, Ladakh, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.
I am thankful to leaders of all political parties for the concerns they have expressed about the current situation in parts of Jammu & Kashmir.
They are our strength, our source of energy; In fact, people’s power is a vital part of our public life.
Irrespective of whether a civilian or security force personnel is injured or killed, the pain is felt by all of us.
I express deep sympathies to their families.
We are committed to a permanent and peaceful solution to the issue of Jammu & Kashmir in accordance with the basic principles of the Constitution.
We have an open mind and our doors are always open.
We are committed to the welfare of every citizen of the entire State of Jammu & Kashmir.
We have been following the path shown by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji to find a solution.
Jammu & Kashmir is often called the crown of India.
Jammu & Kashmir is not only a matter of our territorial integrity but also defines our nationhood.
We cannot deny the fact that the security forces have suffered a lot of injuries; that they have been the target of planned attacks.
Despite this, our security forces have shown restraint.
Statistics reveal that security personnel have been injured in large numbers.
Even just prior to the recent disturbances, high votes were cast in the constituency of Chief Minister Mehbooba ji.
Therefore, to spread the myth that this is a public agitation is far from the truth.
In some areas certain restrictions were imposed in order to maintain law and order.
This is an administrative way of maintaining law and order.
Otherwise the lives of peace loving people will be affected adversely.
In reality, a common man was not troubled as much by such restrictions, as he was troubled by continuous strikes declared by separatist elements.
During this period, the Amarnath Yatra proceeded smoothly.
In addition, the State Government has taken up a number of initiatives on solar energy in the Ladakh region.
The NEET, CET, and UPSC Civil Services Exams were organised as per schedule.
All essential commodities were provided to citizens.
We are now approaching the crucial season for tourism.
The Apple crop will also be ready for harvest.
This is of paramount importance for the livelihood of a common Kashmiri.
Certain separatist elements are trying to take advantage of this time and disturb the peace in Kashmir, and unnecessarily disrupt the lives of peace-loving citizens.
The fundamental reason for disturbances in Kashmir is cross-border terrorism promoted by our neighbouring country.
Due to terrorism normal life in Kashmir Valley is affected.
Since the start of Terrorist activities in Kashmir in 1989-1990, in action by the Security Forces:
• More than 34,000 AK 47 Rifles were seized.
• More than 5000 Grenade launchers were seized.
• Around 90 LMGs were seized.
• More than 12,000 Revolvers were seized.
• 3 Anti Tank Guns and 4 Anti Aircraft Guns were seized.
• More than 350 Missile Launchers were seized.
• 63,000 kilograms of explosives including RDX and more than one lakh Grenades were seized.
Pakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes.
The time has come when Pakistan shall have to answer to the world for the atrocities committed by it against people in Baluchistan and PoK.
We are fully committed to the fundamental rights of the people.
Our anti-terror laws are more humane than those of any other democracy in the world.
Our governments and our security forces have shown restraint in dealing with these incidents.
India will fight against terrorism with full might and resolve.
This is our national duty.
It is also a fact that Kashmiri Pandits have been displaced from their centuries-old ancestral dwellings in Kashmir Valley.
Such atrocity against a particular community is the misdeed of terrorists trained and armed with weapons by Pakistan, and their sympathizers.
These can never be the deeds of those who believe in “Kashmiriyat.”
For the all round development of Jammu and Kashmir, a decision has been taken for implementing a development package of more than Rs. 80 thousand crore (800 billion rupees) in consultation with the State Government.
This package not only has proposals for roads and electricity projects, it actually envisages development of every region and every section of society of Jammu and Kashmir.
This includes better facility for education of children, employment to youths, modern facility for treatment, facilities for promotion of tourism in the state and special arrangements for production of fruits in the State.
In order to provide employment immediately, the government has decided that 10 thousand Special Police Officers (SPOs), about 1200 Para Military and about 4000 candidates in 5 IR battalions will be recruited.
The PDP-BJP government led by Ms. Mehbooba Mufti is making best efforts to address the State’s problems.
During the last one month, the Government has tackled the situation very carefully in spite of extremely adverse circumstances.
The whole nation stands with her.
I would like to reiterate that the Central and State Governments are committed to address the people’s genuine grievances and restore peace in the state.
We will deal strictly with acts of violence, terrorism and anti India activities.
At the same time, genuine grievances of every person will be heard and addressed.
I would like to reiterate that all the political parties and all Indians will have to stand united in the fight against terrorism and destructive forces.
At a time when terrorism is spreading its wings across the world, and terrorism is being instigated by our neighbour, we will have to fight this battle unitedly.
The government has an expectation of constructive cooperation from all political parties in this matter.
All political parties will have to bury their differences and cooperate to restore peace and prosperity in the state.
I fully believe that with the active efforts of the state government and with your full cooperation, we will be able to restore normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir very soon.
I would like to reiterate our main steps and our policy in respect of Kashmir:
1) It is the duty of any Government to maintain law and order.
There will be no compromise with terrorism.
2) In today’s age, in accordance with democratic traditions, we will encourage involvement of civil society with citizen activities.
3) We will take forward the political process, in accordance with democratic traditions.
4) The process of connecting Kashmiri youth with economic activities of the State will be speeded up.
5) The States in which people of Jammu & Kashmir are residing, whether they are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or Buddhists or of any religion, should approach them and should make efforts so that they can establish contact with their relatives in Jammu & Kashmir and can apprise them about their own progress and the progress in other States of India.
6) Ministry of External Affairs should make efforts to approach the people of PoK residing in different parts of world and collect information about the miserable conditions in PoK and bring them to the knowledge of the world community.
I once again thank you all for giving your important views and suggestions in this meeting.
I thank you all for supporting the Government.
We are ready to address grievances of all sections within the framework of the Constitution.
And, Excellency, your personal attention and leadership has contributed much to the steady direction, strength and vibrancy in our ties.
Your contributions have been instrumental in forging a wide-ranging Strategic Partnership with India.
The contributions of a large Indian community in Malaysia are of special value.
They have not only nurtured our shared heritage.
Modelled on the Torana Gates of the Sanchi Stupa this stands as a symbol of our abiding friendship.
Malaysian companies are participating in many of our infrastructure projects across different states in India.
We are also converging efforts aimed at food security that are linked to the wellbeing of our farmers.
And, an Ayurveda Chair in the same University is in the pipeline.Its early finalization would further cement our cooperation in this field.Our educational exchanges have always been a strong promoter of people to people ties between our countries.
The signing today of the MOU on Mutual Recognition of Degrees is a landmark development that will benefit the students and societies of both our countries.
Our wide-ranging defence partnership has already brought our armed forces closer.
We are cooperating in:
Excellency Prime Minister Najib,
Let me welcome you once again to India.I thank you for very productive discussions.
I wish you an enjoyable and fruitful stay in India.
Both the countries desire to further strengthen cooperation in fighting international criminality and serious organized crime.
The Prime Minister said all major religions of the world are present in India, and in big numbers too.
He said the Indian diaspora carries these values with it wherever they go, and hence they are great ambassadors for India.
The Prime Minister spoke of his Government’s initiatives so far, and of his plans especially on Swachh Bharat and Clean Energy, to transform the lives of India’s citizens.
He said India would lead a global “Solar Alliance” of countries blessed with abundant solar radiation, to pursue the goal of economical solar energy generation.
India is much bigger and far greater than what you see on TV screens and newspaper headlines, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the loss of lives and devastation due to tsunami and earthquake in Central Sulawesi in Indonesia.
“Deeply saddened by the loss of lives and devastation due to tsunami and earthquake in Central Sulawesi in Indonesia.
I offer deepest condolences.
India stands with its maritime neighbour in this difficult hour”, the Prime Minister said.
All the distinguished dignitaries present here,
First of all, I would like to congratulate the 5 award winners from the bottom of my heart.
The country must be watching this event on T.V. and wondering that they are the same Parliamentarians whom they see during the day.
Even the Vice President and the Speaker Madam must be really delighted to be a witness to this event as everyone is calm and composed.
I hope that such a scenario will also exist in both the houses of the Parliament and may we and our Parliamentarians who are associated with the sorrows of the common man, get the opportunity to speak.
The government must be compelled to prioritize their issues.
The voices of the poor, the villages and the forests must reach the government through these Parliamentarians in such a way that the government too is compelled to empathize with their feelings and work towards addressing those issues.
Unfortunately, that opportunity of a Parliamentarian is often lost.
He must have attained his field of perfection with a lot of hard work.
He is definitely rich in terms of the work done; he is an authority in his own field.
However, because of pandemonium, chaos and noise the government per se is not that much affected as much as the country is.
It also does tremendous amount of damage to the representatives who have come here after a lot of hardwork and struggle to speak about the problems of the people but are not given the opportunity to speak.
Therefore, it is also a loss of that region and the local people of that region to which he belongs.
The chaos is shown on the T.V. for a few minutes or an hour or for the entire day.
Thereafter, it ends.
But, the MP who gets the opportunity to speak, even if he launches a scathing attack on the government, even if he has points to make, his words become a part of the history.
It’s the responsibility of everyone to ensure that the words of every Parliamentarian go on record.
It’s the responsibility of all of us to ensure that the issues related to the villages, poor and farmers, spoken by the Parliamentarians must compel the government to take action.
We can create such a scenario in the House.
The better the atmosphere is, stronger will be the force to carry our nation ahead.
As per my experience, the Parliamentarians never speak anything that is valueless.
Therefore, it is not easy to be a Parliamentarian.
They carry the dreams of 125 crore Indians and the resolutions of the people of their region and with the promise of a bright future.
When our colleagues are honoured, we feel proud that we work with such colleagues.
We feel proud that we areco-workers; we are the Parliamentarians in the same time period.
It is a matter of immense pride and prestige for us.
I once again congratulate you all from the core of my heart and my best wishes are with you.

In this context, expansion of bilateral trade, greater flow of capital between two economies, and stronger developmental partnership are a priority.
Yesterday, President Kenyatta led a strong and high level delegation to the eighth Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit.

Shri Ramnath Kovind, Governor of Bihar,
Venerable KHAMBA LAMA CH.
DEMBEREL from Mongolia,
Venerable MING KUANG SHI from Taiwan,
Venerable THICH THIEN TAM from Vietnam,
Venerable TELO TULKU RINPOCHE from Russia,
Venerable Banagala Upatissa from Sri Lanka,
Venerable LAMA LOBZANG,
My Ministerial colleague Shri Kiren Rijiju,
Venerable members of the Maha Sanga, visiting Ministers and Diplomats from foreign countries,
I am very happy to be in the midst of all of you.
I feel very blessed to be here at Bodh Gaya.
After Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, I have the opportunity to visit this sacred place.
In this symposium we have been talking about one of the most impactful teachers in world history, Gautama Buddha.
His teachings have inspired millions of people over centuries.
Today, we are also celebrating Janmashtami, the day Lord Krishna was born.
The world has so much to learn from Lord Krishna.
When we talk about Lord Krishna we say, श्री कृष्णम वंदे जगतगुरुम -Shri Krishna, the teacher of all teachers; the Guru of all Gurus.
Both, Gautama Buddha and Lord Krishna have taught the world so much.
The themes of this conference, in a way are inspired by the values and ideals given by these two greats.
Gautama Buddha gave the eight-fold path and the Panchsheel. while Shri Krishna gave invaluable lessons of life in the form of Karma Yoga.
This is, therefore the ideal venue for a dialogue and meeting here on the auspicious day of Janmashtami and the special day of Teachers’ Day makes this unique.
Spiritual and religious leaders and also intellectuals, largely from Buddhist societies participated in the two day conference and deliberated on the two issues.
At the end of the two day conference, and after a churning in which spiritual, religious and intellectual leaders participated, the Tokyo Foundation has announced that they have decided to hold a similar conference in January 2016.
And other Buddhist nations have also offered to hold similar conferences in their countries.
This is an extraordinary development which coincides with the rise of Asia as an economic and civilisational phenomenon.
The themes of the conference, informed and shaped by the Hindu-Buddhist civilisational and cultural perspectives, promise to deepen the notion of conflict avoidance philosophy and environmental consciousness in Asia and beyond.
The two day conference seems to have arrived at a broad consensus on both issues.
I may add that the United Nations too has arrived at the view that sustainable development is achievable only through aligning development to the local culture of the people.
This, in my view, is a positive turn in the development modelling of the world of diversity.
I may add that the turn in thinking at the global level has created the eco-system for the Hindu-Buddhist societies to carry forward their consensual ideas to the global fora.
I personally consider the Hindu Buddhist Conference on Conflict Avoidance and Environmental Consciousness as an important development in a world that seems to be short of durable ideas on both issues.
Hindu philosophy was one of the greatest beneficiaries of the advent and the teachings of the Lord Buddha.
Many scholars have analysed the impact of Buddha on Hinduism.
In fact, Adi Sankara was even critiqued for the way he was influenced by the Buddha and Sankara was called as “Prachhanna Boudha” — meaning Sankara was Buddha in disguised form.
That was the extent of influence of the Buddha on Adi Sankara, regarded by many as the tallest Hindu philosopher.
At the mass level Buddha was so venerated that Jayadeva in his Geeta Govinda even praised him as Mahavishnu or God himself who descended to preach Ahimsa.
So, Hinduism after the Buddha’s advent became Buddhist Hinduism or Hindu Buddhism.
They are today an inseparable amalgam.
Buddha never bowed down to anything, neither Veda, nor caste, nor priest, nor custom.
Buddha was more brave and sincere than any teacher.
Buddha was the first human being to give to this world a complete system of morality.
He was good for good’s sake, he loved for love’s sake.
Buddha was the great preacher of equality.
Every man and woman has the same right to attain spirituality— that was his teaching.
I would personally call India Buddhist India as it has imbibed all the values and virtues of the teachings of Buddha by their religious scholars incorporating them in their literature.
And this is what sustains the secular character of India.
The Enlightenment which Buddha attained in Bodh Gaya also lit the light of enlightenment in Hinduism.
As the first Servant of this ancient nation I revere Buddha as a reformer of not only Hinduism but also the world, who has given all of us a new world view and vision which is critical for the survival of all of us and the entire world.
I recognise how Buddhists all over the world revere Bodh Gaya as a place of pilgrimage.
I am happy to read the Declaration of Buddhist Religions and Spiritual Leaders.
I also echo Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who the other day highlighted the importance of tolerance, appreciation of diversity, and spirit of compassion and fraternity.
His message to this august gathering and his continuous support for furthering this initiative is a matter of great strength for us.
Once again, my congratulations and best wishes to you all.
This conference has raised a hope and urge to go beyond clash and create a dialogue framework for civilizational harmony and world peace.
I wish you well in your constant and determined efforts to ensure that our wisdom reaches the future generations and that too in a manner in which they can practically relate to.
This is essential not for us or them but for the progress of the entire human race and the beautiful surroundings which we have got from Mother Nature.
The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the MoU between India and Finland for collaborating based on mutual interest in the field of Biotechnology, for funding and implementing ambitious industry-led innovative and transnational projects within the broad scope of research development and innovation.

Thousands of you have travelled from far-off lands to join us here today.
Millions more are connected through digital platforms.
We are celebrating this event in the beautiful city of Bengaluru.
Friends, For my government and for me personally, engagement with the overseas Indian community has been a key area of priority.
Tomorrow, 30 overseas Indians will receive from the President, the prestigious Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards, which recognize contributions made by them in various fields, both in India and abroad.
Whether it is on loss of their passports, need for legal advice, medical assistance, shelter, or even transportation of mortal remains to India, I have directed all Indian embassies to be proactive to address problems of Indian nationals abroad.
Prior to that, we evacuated several thousands of our citizens from conflict situations in Yemen in well-coordinated, smooth and swift operations.
We are aware of difficulties faced by Persons of Indian Origin from these countries in obtaining an OCI Card if they moved abroad four or five generations ago.
We remain committed to addressing similar difficulties of PIOs in Fiji, Reunion Islands, Suriname, Guyana and other Caribbean States.
Under the scheme an overseas Indian can work for one to three months in an institution in India.
To provide the young Indian-origin youth an opportunity to visit their motherland and reconnect with their Indian roots, culture, and heritage– we have expanded the Government’s Know India Program, under which for the first time, six groups of young over-seas Indians are visiting India this year.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, attended the CPSE Conclave at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi today.

Complimenting the PSE employees for their contribution, the Prime Minister said that major objectives of the Government, such as electrifying all unelectrified villages, and providing LPG connections to the poor, could not have been fulfilled without the hard work of the PSE workers.
He said Incentives, Imagination and Institution Building would be the three keys to success.
The Prime Minister exhorted PSEs to help in making the New India, through changes in technology and processes.
For this he said, PSEs would need a 5-P formula – Performance, Process, Persona, Procurement and Prepare.
Elaborating the same, he mentionedimproving operational and financial performance; transparency and accountability in processes; procurement through the GeM platform and from MSMEs; and preparation for technological disruptions such as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing and Robotics.

By 2022, what new development model will Indian PSUs give the country?
He said PSUs can also play a key role in reducing India’s import bill.
Noting that CPSEs have modern R&D infrastructure, in addition to the facilities that exist in CSIR and ICAR etc, the Prime Minister said that innovation and research now need to be integrated.
In this context, he called for greater information sharing among CPSEs and Government Departments.
The Prime Minister suggested that the CSR spend of CPSEs should be focused largely on one specific theme each year.
In this context, he noted the success that was achieved when this CSR spend was utilized for toilet construction in schools.
He said one good theme could be the development of aspirational districts.
He said CPSEs can also take up skill development programmes, as part of CSR.
The Prime Minister said CPSEs can work as role models in many areas such as paperless work culture, cashless transactions, and waste management.
The Prime Minister expressed hope that CPSEs would participate in a big way in realizing the resolve of New India.

His Excellency, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Distinguished
I’m delighted that I got the opportunity to welcome my unique friend, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in India, especially in Gujarat.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the Sabarmati Ashram with him.
Today both of us visited the Dandi Kutir.
This is a very big step.
This is not just the beginning of high speed rail.
While looking forward at our future needs, I consider this new railway philosophy as the lifeline of a New India.
India’s uninterrupted progress has now been attached to a much faster pace.
Mutual trust and faith, understanding of each other’s interests and concerns, and continuous high level interactions, this is the uniqueness of Indo-Japan relations.
The scope of our special strategic and global partnership is not confined to bilateral or regional levels only.
We also have close cooperation on global issues.
Last year, during my visit to Japan, we had a historic agreement for peaceful use of nuclear energy.
I express my gratitude to the people of Japan, Parliament of Japan, and especially Prime Minister Abe for its ratification.
This agreement has added a new chapter to our cooperation on the issue of clean energy and climate change.
Now Japan is the third largest investor in India.
At the same time, I would also request the Japanese business community to open more Japanese restaurants in India!
Today, India is on the path of a radical change at many levels.
Whether it is ease of doing business or Skill India, taxation reforms or Make in India, India is transforming completely.
This is a huge opportunity for Japanese businesses.
And I’m glad that many Japanese companies are deeply involved with our flagship programs.
We will also get to see its direct benefit during our conversation in today’s evening program with the business leaders of both the countries.
I am confident that our dialogue and the agreements signed by us today will further strengthen the partnership between India and Japan in all areas.
With these words, I once again warmly welcome Prime Minister Abe and the high level delegation accompanying him.
